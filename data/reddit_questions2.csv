0,TrueAskReddit,Why does the president seem so personally interested in action against Syria?,"I've been reading through these comments, and I don't think any of them strike at the truth of the matter. I apologize if this seems blunt. Hereafter I will provide a detailed examination of US interest in Syria.

[Realpolitik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik)
>refers to politics or diplomacy based primarily on power and on practical and material factors and considerations, rather than ideological notions or moral or ethical premises. In this respect, it shares aspects of its philosophical approach with those of realism and pragmatism.

Chemical weapons aren't why the president is interested in Syria. The US has [actually](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:5tUKceCYXx0J:online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204524604576611443084688006.html+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) been [interested](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9064433/Syria-what-can-Britain-France-and-America-do-after-UN-security-council-veto.html) in [helping the Syrian rebels](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/russia-calls-urgent-council-meeting-syria-20107320) for a long time. That last link is from the past few days, but they're all connected, which I'll get to.

The US has brought several motions to the UN. Things involving military force, military aid, or war in general are brought to the [UN Security Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_council), a 12 member group consisting of 5 permanent members: US, UK, France, China, and Russia. The permanent members of the council have a special privilege: if any one of them vetoes a motion, it fails automatically. As I said, the US has brought several motions to the UN, which I linked above. All of them have failed, and all of them have failed because Russia (and China) have vetoed them using their veto powers.

So the US has long been interested in helping the Syrian rebels-- why is Russia concerned with vetoing efforts to help them? This is what it's all about: the politics of power. Realpolitik.

Syria, ruled by Bashar al-Assad (who functions basically as a dictator) is Russia's only ally in the Middle East region. The Russians sell a lot of arms to the Syrian government, and importantly the Russian's only naval base in the Mediterranean is based in Tartus, Syria. So, for geostrategic reasons alone, we can see that Russia is interested in keeping the friendly Syrian government in power. Though this isn't the Cold War, Russia is a competitor, so to some extent the US is interested in seeing the Syrian government fall because it would reduce the influence of a competitor in the region.

Another ally of Syria is Iran. You see, al-Assad is an Alawite-- a sect of Shiite Islam. Iran is majority Shiite Islam. The history is too long to recount here, but basically: Islam is divided into two major branches, Sunni and Shiite, [which are not friends with each other](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations). Iran and Syria are the only countries in the Middle East with Shiites in power, and Iran is the only country that actually has a majority of its citizens Shiites. It's in Iran's interest to keep the Syrian government in power, as they are the only other Shiite buddy in the region. This, too, is a reason why the US wants the Syrian government to fall; one of our longstanding goals is to remove the Iranian theocracy and prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Removing a friend of Iran reduces their power and influence. Recently to this end of stopping Iran, the US has [spent several years encouraging international adoption of economic sanctions against Iran.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15983302)

Then, there is Israel to consider. Syria borders Israel to its north, and the two have had quite a lot of tension before; during the [Six-Day War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War), Israel occupied the Golan Heights and effectively annexed it, in contravention of international law. The two have not been on good terms. In 2006, Israel got into a short war with its other neighbor to the north, Lebanon, during which time [Syria threatened to join the war on Lebanon's side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Syria_relations#Syrian_alliance_with_Iran:_2006-present). Naturally, Israel would rather the Syrian government fall. As the US is an ally of Israel and Israel in turn provides an ally to us in the region, it's in our interest to help Israel's interest.

Looking more broadly, there are regional issues. As I mentioned earlier, Syria's government is Shiite, while the majority of the Middle East is Sunni. Another element is that the majority of **Syria** is also Sunni; [the Shiites comprise 10-20% of Syria's population, while Sunnis are 60-70%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Syria). However, Bashar al-Assad and his father before him (also a dictator) are Alawite Shiites, and so Shiites have reigned supreme in Syria, building up resentment among the Sunni citizens because of decades-long minority rule by a group that the Sunnis consider to be heretical. This tension in the Middle East as a whole, Sunni vs. Shia, and in the country of Syria specifically, have provided sectarian lines for the population to divide themselves among. And because people in other countries want to see their particular side win, this means that [foreign-based sectarian groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war#Sectarianism) have rushed to help their side win the war, making it a regional proxy for the division between Sunni and Shia. Those groups, by the way, include [Hezbollah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah), a Shia paramilitary group who has long been an enemy of Israel, as well as the [Al-Nusra Front](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Nusra_Front), a Sunni Islamist paramilitary group who are associates of Al-Qaeda. Obviously, this situation could easily cross borders outside of Syria and develop into a regional war. Since the US depends on the Middle East for oil, this would obviously be a bad situation for the US.

BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE! And as always, it involves oil (and natural gas). 

Qatar, a small country next to Saudi Arabia, (and coincidentally a good US ally) sought a few years ago [to build a natural gas pipeline from itself up to Turkey](http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/qatar-seeks-gas-pipeline-to-turkey), and from there on to Europe. Turkey (also a good US ally) was also interested in this deal, as it would make Turkey a key player in Europe's energy sector by being the transit conduit for a large component of Europe's oil and gas, which would go through the proposed [Nabucco pipeline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabucco_Pipeline#Motivation) connecting Turkey to Europe. However, this all fell through. Instead, [Iran, Iraq, and Syria](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:OyQkp4wvmvcJ:online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903591104576467631289250392.html+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a) came to a deal to transport gas from the [South Pars gas field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pars_/_North_Dome_Gas-Condensate_field) in Iran through Iraq and then to port in Syria, from where it could be sold to Europe, bypassing Turkey. The kicker? The South Pars gas field is shared between Iran and Qatar, so if Iran got a pipeline in place first, there would be no need for a pipeline from Qatar to Turkey, meaning both Qatar and Turkey don't get the money and influence they desire. So, obviously, Turkey and Qatar are interested in seeing the Syrian government *change its mind*, and unsurprisingly, [have both condemned the Syrian government and encouraged support for the rebels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_reactions_to_the_Syrian_civil_war#UN_member_governments). So, being that Turkey and Qatar are both allies of the US, it is once again in US interests to help their allies. But the US is interested in the Turkish-Qatari gas line for an entirely separate reason as well.

Russia is a big natural gas exporter. In fact, [they supply much of Europe with its natural gas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_in_the_European_energy_sector#Natural_gas_deliveries), to the point where they are a monopoly in most Eastern European countries, and double-digit percentages to France, Germany, and Italy. This dominance has also given them monopoly-pricing, which has caused friction between Russia and other European countries. In 2009, [this got so bad that Russia cut all gas deliveries to Europe for 13 days](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Russia%E2%80%93Ukraine_gas_dispute), creating an energy crisis in Europe that was only resolved after Ukraine (the main country Russia's pipelines go through) basically folded to Russian demands. Now, this is obviously terrible for our European allies, as they have little or no options when it comes to Russia's demands. So, [Europe has been trying to diversify its natural gas suppliers.](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/07/18/uk-energy-gas-europe-analysis-idUKBRE96H0SE20130718) Unfortunately, it has not done so successfully so far. Guess who was one potential supplier? That pipeline from Turkey. Europe badly needs another supplier of gas, though, so they'd likely be willing to accept gas from the Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline even though that would involve buying gas from Iran, helping its economy. This is bad for the US, precisely because we sought economic sanctions on Iran to *stop* Europe from buying oil and helping its economy. So, once again it is in the United States' interest for Syria to change its mind on the pipelines. Additionally, since Russia is a rival, reducing its control over European energy markets is a strategic goal for the US in and of itself, so helping our European counterparts also helps us. Helping them, of course, means overthrowing the Syrian government.

Tl;dr The US has strategic and geopolitical reasons for needing to overthrow the Syrian government. Inevitably, this also includes trade deals regarding oil."
1,TrueAskReddit,"Why does the world come together spending hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to launch rescue efforts for a group of people who simply made an unwise decision, but nobody lifts a finger if a one-off person makes an unwise financial decision or suffers an accident that cripples them?","Being blunt but here are my two big factors:

1. **The story is relatable**. Anyone who has kids who go to soccer practice can imagine some sort of weather event. We can't all imagine being homeless, or losing access to clean water and food.

2. **The story will have a resolution**. At the end of the story, these kids will go back to a pretty normal life or be dead. The homeless and 3rd-world folks will still face other struggles. Flint residents will have to move on to deal w/the many other systemic issues you'd expect from a majority African American city that's been on the decline since the 1960s.

As others say, it's not fair that this is the case. But these are what I see as the main causes."
2,TrueAskReddit,"What atrocities are occurring around the world right now, and what actions can an individual take to help rectify them?","My heart is particularly called out to the Congo. 

On the Eastern shores of the DRC, on the border with Rwanda, there's a lake called Kivu. In the provinces around Lake Kivu, armed militia men have been fighting a scattered and desperate war for years, enslaving locals, killing indiscriminately, and all too often using rape as a weapon of war. They seek separation from Kabila's government, and in theory, want their own separate country. They are the remnants of warriors in the Rwandan Civil War -- a genocide that claimed a million lives, and in the years after, due to the Great Congo War, millions more. 

How do those rebels stay afloat? Partially through monies from foreign governments, likely Rwanda and Uganda. But on a more regular day basis? Consumer electronics our country buys by the millions. The minerals in your phone, laptop, ipod, ipad, etc., etc., largely come from the Congo -- and many of the mines that hold these minerals are run by vicious rebels. 

If you want to help put an end to the crisis, I'd point you to [The Enough Project](http://www.enoughproject.org/). Find out which of your electronics are most likely to fund a war, and check out steps you can take to see it end. 

EDIT: Some have expressed problems figuring out which of their electronics are most likely funding war -- here's the direct link:

3,TrueAskReddit,How can a male boss better lookout and protect his female employees from being sexually harassed?,"By firing the guy you already did more than you think. The girl working for you didn't regret standing up for herself. That is already a step in a right direction, and if anything similar ever happens they won't be afraid or embarrassed to come talk to you."
4,TrueAskReddit,"Our society needs to address complex problems that require huge amounts of cooperation. Yet, I can't even convince my neighbor upstairs to be considerate of the people living below him. How are we not doomed as a species?","You want optimism out of nihilism? Our greed is a stronger vice than our stupidity. 

As a social animal, our survival goals really do require cooperation. Selfishness is a luxury we can only afford when things are good. When things get bad enough, we end up cooperating because we like being alive more than we like being fractious douchebags."
5,TrueAskReddit,"If the U.S. economy is ""booming"" why does it still feel like it sucks so much?","A lot of it is the stock market is doing well, which doesn't help a lot of people.  Also, we have historic ROI in the market.  It is really unsustainable, yet investors push companies to keep it up.  (the market tripling in 8 year when it didn't triple in decades is unsustainable.   Part of the way you keep that ROI up is to push for higher productivity, which translates into getting more out of people without paying them more."
6,TrueAskReddit,Covid 19 stay-at-home rules cut California traffic deaths in half. Is it inappropriate to discuss why we are more accepting of some untimely deaths and less accepting of others?,"Wait, what? Your takeaway shouldn’t be, “we should accept recurring covid-19 deaths because people die of other things”, it should be, “why do we accept commuting on a massive scale, and city design that requires tons of driving, thus resulting in way more deaths than should be acceptable”. 

We have the technology to work remotely for many knowledge/office jobs.

We know how to build healthy, livable, walkable towns. 

It’s obviously a massive change, and it can’t/won’t happen overnight ... but we should begin reshaping our world *precisely* because of what this unprecedented event has shown us."
7,TrueAskReddit,"I feel as if the years of internet use has re-wired my brain to seek constant instant gratification. I'm sick of it, how can I undo this?","Go unplug for a weekend. The desert, the mountains,  what ever is close to you. Or take a roadtrip with a friend. Go outside with a book and leave your phone at home. You need to take some conscious time to unhook yourself and let your brain remember what it's like to focus on one thing at a time. Sure, camping or a hike might sound boring to you, but it seems like you need a change of pace to try and shed some bad habits."

9,TrueAskReddit,What are the best arguments AGAINST legalizing marijuana?,"Here are some of the arguments that I'm aware of - I make no judgment on how strong the argument is.

- the science is inconclusive on the health effects of prolonged use of cannabis via smoking
- criminal enterprises will set up legal shops and use the legally gotten money to finance illegal activities
- making it legal will give children the impression that its use is safe and okay, even though studies have shown that young teens experience various setbacks from using marijuana
- there is no reliable way to prevent users from driving while impaired, or to measure drivers suspected of being impaired
- legalization of recreational use diminishes (somehow) the ability of medical users to legitimize their use (or some variation of this argument - isn't that one of the ones used to defeat legalization in California in the 2010 election on prop 19)
- legalization would lead to a surge in use, compounding already-high rates of substance use problems

Again, not saying that any of these are *good* arguments, just that they are arguments against legalizing."
10,TrueAskReddit,Why are Millennials seemingly suffering so much more with mental health?,Millennials are the first generation to come of age since cultural attitudes about mental health started changing. This has been partially caused by research that has lead us to a better understanding of what actually causes mental illness. A lot of that research has identified actual causes for issues that were previously passed off as behavioral or revealed that known conditions have a spectrum of less severe effects. This has lead to more people being diagnosed because we understand what constitutes mental illness better than we did before.
11,TrueAskReddit,"As someone from another country, why do americans have such a highly competitive culture and are so mad about getting college degrees?","I've spent a very small amount of time in Germany, both on my own and living with some friends. What I observed is that, in general, people are neither poor nor wealthy. That lines up with what you're saying with, ""you have a job, you get paid ok, not super high, not low, and that's it."" The big difference between what I would describe as middle class, or comfortable, in Germany and that same quality of life in the USA is *risk.*

In Germany, you are never at risk of going bankrupt and becoming homeless because you got sick. You won't be fired from your job because you got sick and had to miss work. You get time off from work to rest (vacation), and even get mental healthcare. None of these things are a given in the USA.

The only way to decrease the risk for us is to get a better job, but even that is no guarantee. In most states, we can be fired for no reason and with no notice. So we always have to be working extra hard to prove to our employers that we are worthy and should get to keep our jobs. If we lose our jobs, we risk destitution and homelessness, not just for us, but for our families.

Because employers in Germany can't fire an employee at will, that has resulted in longer-term relationships between employers and employees, which results in loyalty. And because people are generally less afraid due to decreased risk in Germany, they can afford to stick around. We don't have that.

So you get a college degree so you can get a better job. You switch from job to job so you can get more money. You don't develop loyalty to a company because companies aren't loyal to you. The end-goal is to amass enough wealth so that one can rest without worrying too much. But the worry never fully goes away, because unless you have tens of millions in the bank, all it takes is an illness that puts you out of work (and our health insurance is provided by our employers, so if you lose your job and your health insurance, you're screwed) and costs a lot to treat (like cancer) and you could lose it all.

I had a friend who had twins a couple of years ago. Due to complications, she was in the hospital for a while and her bills were over $1 million. She had a job and insurance, but just imagine if she had been unemployed at the time. Stuff like that can be devastating.

I have a great job with a high salary and I work for a British company that has different values than an American one. But even I can't shake that fear that US work culture instills. Even though I love my job and they seem to like me pretty well and it's probably quite secure, I'm still focused on paying off debt (at this point, really just our mortgage) to decrease our monthly expenses so that, if I lose my job, I can afford to take a big pay cut and we'll still be OK. That's the kind of thing that has to be on our minds a lot: what happens if? what will I do if? where will I go if?

In Germany, the government provides a lot of that security. You don't have to worry about these things. In the USA, we really only have ourselves."
12,TrueAskReddit,Roommate installed a key-logger. Suggestions?,"1. This should be obvious and hopefully you've already done it. Set up two-factor authentication on any and all of your accounts that allow it.

2. From a computer that you can be reasonably sure hasn't been compromised (perhaps a family member's) change the passwords of all the services that don't have two-step authentication. Change the verification email too, if possible.

3. As soon as you can, go to your bank and ask them what else to do. You probably won't get much more than ""Change your passwords and be more careful"", but it doesn't hurt to find out. Maybe there's extra security stuff they can do for you.

4. Even if you don't have money to actually hire a lawyer, many of them offer free consultations. At least listen to what they might have to say, the legal ramifications might be a lot more far-reaching than we'd know offhand. What if your roommate had been conducting illegal activity on your accounts? You'll want to protect yourself even if you don't think the situation's likely.

5. I'm not sure what kind of keylogger we're talking about here, but if it's a software one then using another OS should be enough to avoid it (as far as I know). Look into booting from a Live CD or something every time you need to do important stuff on your computer. Hopefully someone can chime in here and confirm/deny whether this will work for sure. That way you can leave the evidence and hopefully still keep using your computer, but I'd avoid using it for important stuff if you have an alternative.

6. Put a lock on your door, try to kick the roommate out, etc. Hopefully you can get the second roommate to side with you, after all how would he know if the same thing has been happening to him."
13,TrueAskReddit,Why does it seem like more is happening about the college scandal than the Panama Papers?,"Because the college scandal is about a specific thing that most people can get their heads around; even people who didn't go to college have a pretty solid idea of how hard it is to get in, how much a middle-class family has to reorganize their lives to be able to pay for it.

In other words, the average person can easily understand exactly WHAT these people stole, and understand that your cousin Sarah might have gotten into USC if it hadn't been for these assholes. 

The violation is tangible.

With the Panama Papers, it's so big and ill-defined as to be abstract. Everyone thinks ""Hey, a bunch of rich people did some more of that tricky financial shit we all know rich people do. Bastards."" but nobody REALLY understands the nature of the crimes involved."
14,TrueAskReddit,"Why do we tell kids things like “appearances don’t matter” and “it’s not about winning, it’s about having fun” when that is so clearly bull at best and actively causing problems at worst?","I was told by parents and coaches ""it doesn't matter if you win our lose, it's how you play the game"" and as a kid I thought that was BS. Now that I'm a bit older, I see the kernel of truth that wining isn't as important as improvement. If you spend all of your time fighting below your weight class, the only thing you're working out is your ego. Your real opponent It's always your past self. It's how you play the game."
15,TrueAskReddit,"How is it that we, as a society, are richer than ever, but cannot afford to pay people living wages or to keep important institutions funded?","An early writer addressing some of these thoughts wrote [a book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread) that appeared in 1892, for example, writing about how the people of Paris could feed and support themselves on around 4hrs of work per day.

The reason is ultimately socio-political -- it's completely against the interests of the most powerful members of society to let us share our resources efficiently and to organize in a way which would allow technology to deliver on it's ever tantalizing promise of freeing us from daily mindless drudgery."
16,TrueAskReddit,What can actually be done about police in the United States?,"Well, Let’s see.  Take away their military gear.  Start a national bad cop database so they can’t move and be rehired.  Make them carry the equivalent of malpractice insurance instead of having a tax payer funded defense when they go over the top.  Raise pay to attract a better group of candidates.  Institute oversight like civilian review boards with real teeth.  That’s just off the top of my head.    Edit: wow. Thanks for the gold.  :)"
17,TrueAskReddit,"Why is a celebrity that has raped (Kobe Bryant, Mike Tyson) still acceptable in the social eye, but somebody like Mel Gibson and Michael Richards shunned for saying racist things?","Mike Tyson took nearly two decades to reach a point he would be accepted on the Today Show or able to do a nationwide tour of a one-man show. He spent most of his boxing career saying and doing completely vile things and was largely pushed to the perimeter of the sports world. However, as others have pointed out, if you serve the punishment, it certainly leads you towards a comeback (and as a former Philly resident, I can tell you the Michael Vick stains are still quite raw).

Also, I believe Mel Gibson's decline in movie-making is largely self-imposed (he's been focusing on a megachurch he has in Beverly Hills) and Michael Richards didn't really have that long to fall (it's notable he joined a Seinfeld reunion on *Curb Your Enthusiasm* about a year after his incident and participated in Jerry Seinfeld's online project *Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee*)."
18,TrueAskReddit,Why are we still so busy and working full work days despite having technology?,"Oh, it's not just technology. Methodology and organization have become better, too. As a result? Economic productivity is way, way up. GDP, or gross domestic product, is way, way up. Corporate profits are way, way up. 

What matters is what's happening to all of this extra efficient labor and profit. For the vast majority of workers, hours have not decreased and wages have not increased, either at the rate of productivity and profit increase. Instead, as is often the case, economic growth disproportionately goes to members of the top economic class. Some of this is in the form of salary, some of it is in the form of investment, and some of it is in the form of dynastic wealth or inheritance. 

[Check out the interactive graph listed under #1 on this site](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/), based on data from the Urban Institute. Start at 1963 and go through to 2016, looking at how the distribution of family wealth has changed. Now, don't ignore that the numbers at the bottom are changing, too, some of the benefits of the economic have reached the lower and middle classes, but the vast majority clearly have gone to the upper classes. 

It's like a machine. In one end you put in more effective human labor and better technology, and on the other end you see wealth grow primarily for the wealthy. That's why you're not working less hours, because the rewards are not being funneled to reduce average worker hours."
19,TrueAskReddit,Why do so many people treat the humanitarian crisis in North Korea like a joke?,"We feel like there's not much we can do about the situation- military action would be a South Korean bloodbath even if it didn't lead to nuclear attacks or conflict with China, North Korea regularly ignores diplomatic agreements, and humanitarian aid doesn't address the underlying issues, and may be used as an excuse by the government to focus on military development at the expense of agriculture and infrastructure.

When people feel powerless to change something horrible, gallows humor is one way of dealing with that."
20,TrueAskReddit,Should a father be able to terminate parental rights if he doesn’t want a baby but the mother does?,"A man already has the ability to prevent a pregnancy - by wearing a condom. Why should the onus to prevent pregnancy fall completely on the woman?

And if you think men should have more options to prevent pregnancy then why not call for more resources to be put towards creating a male contraceptive pill?"
21,TrueAskReddit,"Why are ISPs so monopolized in the US? How did it get this way, and how can we get to a situation with more market competition?","It’s partly because they own the cables, partly because of regulations, and partly because of politics. Cable companies invested money early on to lay cable to individual homes. Since they own the cable, they’re not required to allow any other provider to access them. The idea here is if you wanted to choose between cable companies, you would have to have several different cables drawn to your house, and you would choose which one to connect your modem to. This is obviously impractical.

The other side is regulation. The same thing happened with telephone lines, but the government decided to regulate phone lines as a utility, meaning AT&T had to allow other providers to access the lines. This is why you could choose between long distance providers back in the day. The internet is not regulated as a utility. This was a battle during the Obama administration, but he lost.

In addition to regulation, these cable companies were able to convince local municipalities to sign ridiculous non-compete contracts. Basically a cable company would say “you want us to run cable in your town? Well we have to protect our investment, so give us a local monopoly.” And the towns said yes. That’s why you’re now seeing news stories about cities fighting to build municipal broadband networks, and the cable companies are taking them to court. These contracts also prevent other competitors from running additional cables. This was an issue Google Fiber faced in a lot of areas.

From the cable company perspective, the argument is this. It’s very expensive to build out cable networks to every home. So in order for us to take on the risk, we need assurance that we will be able to make gobs of profit. So we need exclusive rights to the cables, and local monopolies.

My only hope now is for 5G wireless to upend this system. 5G is supposed to be able to provide high speed wireless internet to your home. So you will at least be able to choose between the handful of wireless providers you have today. Of course the challenge there is data caps, but we are seeing at least some competition driving unlimited plans, so hopefully they will adopt a bandwidth model for the home, rather than a data cap."
22,TrueAskReddit,"Redditors who are advanced in years, how does the current political climate relate to other times of political upheaval such as the civil rights era?","I'm 63, there has always been some political discord.  I think that the biggest difference today is social media and the ease of being trollish, spamy, and just downright nasty and abhorrent a greater sense of us vs them that allows acceptance of these behaviors of the anonymous."
23,TrueAskReddit,"Is America really the kind of liberal, wealthy, educated and powerful country portrayed in foreign media?",">That means America supports extreme form of free speech, that anyone can insult anyone or any authority

>That people there have lots of sex, and consume a lot of alcohol.

Some do, some don't.

>That women and men can wear almost anything without being criticized (like women can go around in bikinis and no one bats an eye).

Nah, people get judgemental over the clothing choices of others all the time. If you are at the beach, nobody will bat an eye, but if you wear a bikini on the street you might get some angry looks.

>That people there support LGBT and promiscuity to the fullest

These are controversial issues in the US. Gay marriage is legal and has popular support, but there is a sizable contingent of people who don't like it. Promiscuity is also a big part of the ""culture war."" 

>That parents there divorce and marry all the time

The majority do not, but a sizable amount of married couples divorce.

>and have no time for kids.

Not true.

>That parents don't have any control over their children's lives or future. 

You don't dictate your child's future, but that doesn't mean parents don't play a significant role in their children's lives and futures,

>That you can talk to them about anything freely without hesitation

Eh. You can, but a lot of parents won't talk about sex with their kids.

>Is really wealthy - that most people there are rich and earn enough money to live comfortably and often luxuriously. That number of poor people are really less and even those who are poor have income more than a third world country. 

Not exactly. Yes people here earn a lot more than people in 3rd world countries, but things cost a lot more here and expenses like insurance, student, housing, and credit debt can make things difficult. 
There is generally a higher standard of living, but maintaining that is very difficult for a lot of Americans and you have to keep a close eye on your finances.

>Also, they say that your  economy is the best in the world with a lot of money spent on Military and Science

If by best you mean largest, then yes. And yes a lot is spent on military and tech.

>That American education system 'opens students' minds' - that America has the best education system in the world which focuses on 'practicals' rather than rote learning. That the school in America prepares students for real life applications than just prepare them for exams.

Oh that is definitely not true. Education quality varies a lot from area to area, and there is a lot of rote learning involved in schooling. Maybe tests are less emphasized here than India, I don't really know.

>That most of the useful research in the world happens in America - America has a lot of money spent on technological advances for both common use and military and weapons


True. Though non-military tech doesn't make up a large portion of the government budget.

>That if you are the president of USA, you are basically the president of the whole world because (as many people told me) USA has the most influence over the entire world.

The President of the US has more influence and power than any other world leader, but his influence isn't large enough that he can act as president of the world. The president's position is more like a leader among world leaders."
24,TrueAskReddit,Has the U.S. become too polarized to effectively govern under the current political system?,"I disagree, in so far as there have been other moments in history in which the U.S. has become far more polarized than it is now and extreme actions were taken by the government. 

The Civil War is an obvious example, but people often forget that FDR basically put a gun to the Supreme Court's head when they kept striking down his pro-labor policies. Or that the National Guard had to go to Alabama and force them to integrate. In those instances, you had a substantial portion of the population strongly disagreeing with Federal actions and we survived it. This is not even the first time the shutdown tactic has been used by a political party. I mean Christ, you should read about what happened when they tried to tax whiskey in 1791.

This is political theater, dramatized by the media. Most Americans are apathetic or don't care about this beyond a basic knee-jerk reaction. For the ones who do hate the law, I don't see anyone willing to die over it. And of course many people support the ACA. I have no idea if it will work or not, but I do know the healthcare system in this country is broken. I'm open to alternative solutions but there's not really a way to know without experimenting.

The political system has gone through much worse damage than this and survived. "

26,TrueAskReddit,"Is the whole ""the bees are disappearing"" thing really as bad as it's being made out to be?","Yes. Considering that just last winter alone, beekepers lost over 31% of their colonies. They are crucial for pollinating 70% of the 100 crops that are 90% of the produce we buy. No other single pollinator comes close. Other pollinators include ants, solitary or small-hived bees like carpenter or bumble bees, and butterflies. However, because of their social structure (among other things) we are not as readily able to raise them as we have with bees.

The problem is that this is unprecedented, and not a cyclical thing.

27,TrueAskReddit,"Should government-approved marriage be renamed to ""civil union"" for all people?","I don't see why religions should get a *monopoly* on such a socially useful term.

* Marriage predates all current religions
* Marriage terminology is primarily used non-religiously; e.g. in all law and legal documents, contracts, hospital rules, literature, films etc.
* There are religions that provide same-sex marriage ceremonies. Why should the *anti-gay* religions be the decisive factor to determine who gets to use the word?
* Government-approved marriages are called ""civil marriage"" - that is already specific. 

Alternatively; if religions are so offended that gays are using the same word as them, let *them* change their terminology. They already call it holy matrimony; why not simply use that term exclusively? 

The term marriage has already been used for non-religious marriages for many years. For all this time, religious people have been fine with atheists using the term marriage. One has to question the motives of those that have only now started to object to civil marriage when it's potentially extended to gay couples. I don't think it is moral for a state to become complicit in abolishing the term marriage just to prevent those nasty gays from using it."
28,TrueAskReddit,"Why isn't recycling a standard thing in modern human cultures? Even economically, how can it possibly be cheaper to start from raw materials and construct a product rather than recycling already existing ones?","A couple of factors are at play.

First, the material may have changed fundamentally as part of the manufacturing process. Take clay, for example. It changes when it is fired to form pottery. You can't just grind it up and add water and get clay back. So some manufacturing processes are either irreversible, or very resource-intensive to reverse.

Second, even if the material isn't changed, it may be bound to another material that makes it WAY harder to recycle. Look at mylar, a thin film of aluminum bonded to plastic. The aluminum could be recycled by melting it, but it's so thin that nearly all of it would oxidize away in the furnace. But a bigger problem is that it's bound to the plastic. Neither can really be effectively recycled without removing the other (unless you just let all the plastic burn away in a furnace).

This second part is also manifested in end uses. For example, we know how to recycle styrofoam. But if you do something like mix paint in a styrofoam cup, and then add it to a recycling process, the chemicals in the paint can screw up an entire batch. Or take something even simpler; toilet paper. Recycling paper is relatively simple, until it's got a bunch of poop all over it.

Long story short, recycling is just another process. Processes are pretty much never free; they take time, and energy, and other resources. There's nothing about recycling that makes it inherently better in any way, even for the environment. Sometimes, it makes the most sense to use virgin materials."
29,TrueAskReddit,"If being homosexual vs heterosexual was in fact a choice as opposed to a biological predisposition, why would that choice make it an acceptable thing to discriminate against?","(Historian who studies, among other things, the history of human sexuality! I hope I do your question justice, OP.)

What you're seeing, OP, is two related historical processes running head-first into one another. On the one hand, how human sexuality and human sexual choices are understood by different societies have varied wildly over time. Before the 1800s when the study sex became a science called ""sexology"", the idea of a fixed sexual ""identity"" was unheard-of, and historians refer to ""sex acts"" rather than ""sexualities"" for this reason (a man buggering a man in Medieval Europe was an act of sodomy rather than the demarcation of a homosexual).

Because of the rise of sexology and sexological understandings of human sexuality we now in the Western world have this notion of a fixed, immutable sexual identity -- those who don't feel that 'heterosexual' fits their desires and tastes find another word, like 'gay' or 'bi' or 'pan' to self-describe. This notion that a man buggering a man today has a gay sexual *identity*, rather than just being a person who enjoys sex with other men, is why (I suspect) that most people feel that their identity is not a choice that can be changed on a whim.

The second historical process is the historic perceived 'danger' that heterosexuality was under. This is a weird one. In the 40s and 50s, when Kinsey was becoming really big news, people became aware that most of their peers experienced some degree of homosexual desire. Suddenly the ability of people in the Western world to procreate was under a huge threat. To be homosexual was seen as a betrayal, by putting one's own pleasure above the needs of the nation during such an uncertain time. I suspect that this narrative of homosexuality as a selfish, misguided, 'pleasure-first' choice still underpins much of the rhetoric today. (for example, the notion that gay parents can't raise children properly.)

So you have the coming-together of one idea of a fixed sexual identity, and another idea of homosexuality as a 'pleasure-first' lifestyle, that creates the phenomenon you see, OP: people who argue that their choices are not a choice fighting against people who argue that those choices are harmful to society as a whole.

I hope this makes a little sense to you, OP! It's certainly not the be-all and end-all of answers to your question, but it's how I undertsand the situation.

tl;dr: the phenomenon happens because the notion of fixed sexual ""identity"" is running headfirst into the notion of homosexuality as selfish."
30,TrueAskReddit,Has anyone ever just given up on their life and started a new one?,"Several years ago I cut ties with my family, left my friends behind, and moved to a city where I didn't know anyone.

31,TrueAskReddit,Is it immoral to have children when a climate change catastrophe is inevitable?,"There are two things I can say to this: The first is that people have been worried about the moral implications about bringing children into the world for a long time. Back during the Cold War, people were worried about giving birth to kids who would grow up on a nuclear wasteland. Probably back in the caveman era people were worried about having kids when ressources were scarce and predators roamed freely. The point is, there will always be challenges that the younger generation will have to fix, and most likely they will fix it, because they'll have grown up learning how to survive these new standards. In modern times, that can also mean they learn how to fight back through the legal system (like all the students protesting for global warming).

The second is that our planet won't be outright uninhabitable for a long time. We're in the process of making changes that are going to make our way of living more sustainable, and we will survive for generations to come on this rock.

That will give us enough time to start colonising other planets, and with any luck, we'll have learned from our mistakes on this one, and we won't repeat them."
32,TrueAskReddit,"Without intending to insult anyone. Why are americans so ""in love"" with their army?","A lot of it boils down to what happened with the troops that came back from Vietnam.

Vietnam was a very contentious conflict. A lot of people didn't want us to be over there at all. And then we lost the war. The troops that came back were treated very poorly, first by the people that didn't want them to be there in the first place and called them things like baby-killers, mass murderers, etc., and then by the people that were ashamed that we lost.

In the 70s and 80s, we started getting films and TV shows like Apocalypse Now, MASH, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and First Blood (yes, the first Rambo movie is actually a pretty solid exploration of how war turns the soldier into an outsider), and Americans as a whole, and baby boomers in particular, in the 80s went, ""Wow, we were really kind of assholes. Sorry about that."" And then, with the kind of restraint and good taste that boomers as a generation showed throughout their lives, they decided to take it a step further, venerating the troops, making a big show of ""supporting the soldier not the war"" during the 80s and the Gulf conflict in the 90s, and then, at some point, it just turned into ""supporting the soldier, even if that means supporting the war.""

There's also the whole military-industrial complex in the States, who find it advantageous to fetishize military hardware, and the fact that pretty much every state has some kind of tie to the military, whether its weapons manufacturing plants, military bases, etc. makes it even easier."

States are so varied in terms of economic development I don't think a one sized fits all solution is a good one."
38,TrueAskReddit,"Why are some cities sprawled out disconnected messes like Los Angeles, and other cities neatly organized, like Chicago?","Urban Planning switches its focus every few decades.  I think most planners would agree that the big pushes now are to respond either to global warming, or increasing obesity rates.  Prior to about 1970, these problems weren't on the radar.  Instead, the dialogue was about how to reduce city crowding, reduce disease, and prevent fire from spreading so quickly.  Chicago and Los Angeles are simply examples of how this planners attempted to respond to the problem of the day.  

Before we consider either city, let's first look at how cities develop without planning.  Shanty towns are a good example.  If you've never been to one, understand that people build their homes wherever land is available, with whatever material is available.  This leads to streets that are difficult to navigate.  You'll even find people who can't find land, so build in the middle of the street.  Fire spreads easily, and people throw their waste into the street, helping to breed rats and spread disease.  Prior to the 20th century, many European cities fit this bill.  Planners of Los Angeles and Chicago were working in response to this background.  Cars were starting to appear, but weren't nearly as much of a fixture as they are today.  

So with that context, I'll start with Chicago since that's what I know.  The main person responsible for Chicago as it is today is Daniel Burnham who said, ""Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood and probably will not themselves be realized.""  As an architect and a planner, he came to Chicago at the right time.  The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed a lot of the town.  Fires continued to destroy parts of the city.  Meanwhile, approximately 1890 to the 1920s was a good time to be a farmer in the US (thanks to Thomas Jefferson who, in another plan to stop hunger, planned to give every male American citizen a plot of land to feed himself and his family).  It was so profitable a time that people were moving from all over the place.  And Chicago just so happened to be the city along Lake Michigan that would let them ship their grain to the east, to feed the teeming East Coast population.  So for Chicago, think blank slate with a lot of money coming in.  

Then comes the World's Fair.  Daniel Burnham designs some beautiful buildings in a marshy area on the southside.   [Here's what he designed](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Court_of_Honor_and_Grand_Basin.jpg
)  And people loved it.  27 million people visited from around the world.  Of course, the they missed the rest of the city, much of which was just like the preceding centuries, disease, crime, and fire.  And few of Burnham's buildings survived long after the fair.  They were made of plaster so it wasn't a surprise.  But regardless, Burnham struck a chord with the Chicago public.  10 years later, he was trying to impose his vision of an orderly city, with inspiring civic buildings at its center, like Ancient Greece on a grid.  His success at the World's Fair made it an easy sell.  He even showed up at elementary schools to teach children his plan.  By the time things were underway, Chicagoans were almost unanimously subscribed to Burnham's plan.  Streets were laid down, and land plotted out.  People built more houses to fill the city.  Two things favored density in the city.  One was that skyscrapers were just entering their heyday when Chicago was growing.  Two is that winter heat is less expensive if your home is attached to a neighbors.  But with streets designated, and houses in the ground, things were set for Chicago ever since.  The interstate system breaks up the grid somewhat, but otherwise it's a difficult thing to disrupt, even with the rise of the automobile.  

So what's different about Los Angeles?  It actually did have the country's largest rail transit system in the US in the early 1900s.  But that transit system was a reflection of a different idea in place at the time.  While Burnham focused on making the city beautiful, Los Angeles was supposed to be a garden city.  Instead of one grand center, imagine, dozens of inviting, less intense mini-centers spread out to the periphery.  One could have a home with a front lawn, but then walk to the train station and be at work downtown in thirty minutes, also known as streetcar suburbs.  Real estate developers, like Henry Huntington sold this idea in magazines and over the radio, boasting of LA's moderate climate in comparison to the harsh northern winters.  (The Chicago region also saw the allure of garden cities, and so you'll actually find several examples along Chicago's commuter rail lines out in the suburbs.)

And this gets us to three major challenges for both ideas.  First was the car.  The allure was simple.  You could go anywhere anytime you wanted.  No longer were you limited to what was around the streetcar system.  No longer did you have to know the schedule to go anywhere.  And then you have World War II and the GI Bill, giving veterans subsidized home loans.  Houses in the country were no longer for the rich, but for anyone who fought in the war, which was a pretty large amount of people at the time.  

But the car doesn't explain it all.  Desegregation was another big event in the mid 20th century.  No longer was it legal to force black people into one neighborhood.  And many black people, also eligible for the GI bill, started trying to find better neighborhoods within the city.  Real estate agents would warn homeowners that black people were moving in, and that they were better off selling their homes now rather than later.  

This is where the stories of LA and Chicago start to come together.  Now in addition to garden cities, both regions start to see small municipalities pop up along the suburban fringe.  Whereas the streetcar suburbs could hold maybe 50,000 people, these new municipalities held 10,000 to 20,000.  And they were designed largely to keep urban traffic out.  Instead of a grid, you'd see cul de sacs leading to highways leading to the city.  Want to visit your neighbor 500 feet away?  Well, you can't cross anyone's back yard, so may have to drive a half mile or more just to get to the next cul de sac.  Such exclusivity cost money, and it had the larger impact of disconnecting cities from their periphery.  Los Angeles wasn't as grid like to begin with, so had no reason to seek a grid system all of the sudden.  

The third historical challenge for both cities was to maintain a public transit system.  From the beginning, LA's system was not profitable.  But people like Huntington knew that to be able to sell land far away from the city center people needed access. So they subsidized LA's transit system.  When GE came to buy the streetcars later and replace them with buses, and veterans settled in the area permanently, it was hard to justify maintaining fixed route service.  LA lost a lot of its once great transit system.  

So what saved Chicago's transit system?  Politics and parking.  Politics because the mayor at the time, Richard J. Daley, was infamous for his quid pro quo style of running the city.  Transit while declining elsewhere, was something Daley kept around to ensure he had a reward for poor people who voted for him.  Parking comes into play since downtown Chicago has always been a major employment center.  There simply wouldn't be enough parking if the transit system were to collapse, so even though it was losing money due to people switching to cars, it would never be possible for Chicago to have enough downtown parking but for some major collapse of downtown employers.  Los Angeles, conversely, is not nearly as centralized when it comes to employment, hence why there was less pressure to keep a massive transit system in operation, and why it was okay to switch to simple bus service.  

Hopefully that answers part of your question.  As I hope I've imparted to you, there are a lot of reasons theses cities are different, and there are many more things at play than just the introduction of cars.  Thanks for reading!"

But their idea is to have every member of the society receiving a basic income, and they can earn more or not, as they like. The idea is that people are freed of the necessity to earn a living, and then can contribute in the best way to society and to their own personal well being. Some might want to get into high paying jobs, some might want to smoke up and do nothing, some might follow their art, politics, caring professions, etc. This would also reduce the possibilities of exploitation by businesses, because when people aren't on the verge of bankruptcy, they won't let themselves be exploited.

It all sounds a bit utopian right now, but I think that is the way forward. Almost every industrialized country can easily afford to pay every citizen a basic wage. So we have the money, we have the imagination, at least on the political fringe, and we have the future.

43,TrueAskReddit,Why do Americans have a negative attitude towards math and how can I keep my kids from adopting it?,"People here are saying math is hard, math is non-intuitive, math is useless in real life, math is not taught in a fun way, etc. I disagree that these are the reason behind math's lack of popularity. They're very superficial, and mostly a consequence and not the origin of the problem.

**Background**: I've been making [educational math and physics illustrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:LucasVB/Gallery) for the past 10+ years. I've tutored a few people as well and I've worked on some other educational multimedia projects along the way. A lot of my work has been praised for being clear, intuitive and ""more helpful than years of classes"". So judging from the response of others, I'd say my approach to math/physics education has some merit.

----

Now, as others pointed out, this is not really an issue with the US. The lack of appreciation for mathematics is widespread and nearly universal.

I was brought up with the world view that the world is out there to be understood, if only we pay attention to the way it expresses itself. My parents taught me that math, physics, chemistry, biology and etc. are just different ways to understand how different facets of the world around us work.

So from the beginning, my parents taught me and my siblings that the world could be made sense of, and if we put the effort in it, we could understand it.

Humans are naturally curious. Children in all cultures universally ask ""why?"" questions to the exhaustion of their parents's willpower to answer. The usual response is to eventually curb that curiosity for the sake of simplifying the worldview of the children and simplifying the lives of the parents, who get sick of indulging in that curiosity after a while. 

This is a huge mistake.

This worldview that ""BECAUSE IT IS"" or ""BECAUSE X SAID SO"", when taken to heart, naturally inhibits the predisposition of the person to invest in understanding or knowing things. I can't cite studies on this, as I've never heard of anything of the sort being done, but from personal experience people who excel in math and physics (or science, in general) are just very curious people. If you ever dealt with kids asking questions, you'll notice that the curiosity in these people just didn't wear off. It has the same flavor.

That curiosity survived because it was rewarded over the years, and the reward for curiosity is wonder. It is exciting to figure things out. But we use the expression ""childhood wonder"" almost derogatorily these, as if it is naïve to be amazed and excited about things.

So one thing you can do to your kids is merely to indulge their curiosity. Give them the worldview that there's stuff to figure out, and there's ways to obtain answers if you don't know things.

When they ask something you don't know, don't say ""it just is"" or lie. Admit that you don't know. Say ""I don't know, but we can find out!"" and make it an activity to do together, or help them do it themselves. Go search online, or make experiments, **give them the confidence that they have the power to figure things out**.

----

Now, with the proper mindset in place, these kids will face a very different and unenlightening approach when they finally get to study in a school environment. Due to time, knowledge and social constraints, kids will inevitably get a pretty shitty and superficial education, in math or anything else.

But what makes math particularly difficult is that it adds up, it builds on top of itself. If you never understood geometry and algebra, trigonometry and calculus will become fuzzy and weird.

When math is properly understood, every next step is sensible and makes perfect sense. This is exactly the inverse of the perspective everyone seems to have, which is a tragedy on its own. This is clearly reflected in the other comments here.

My point is that math IS intuitive, by default, and when you think it isn't it's your intuition that is wrong. This means your understanding of some aspect of math is incomplete or incorrect. Mathematics is just a series of logical steps with a clear intent, and this is something everyone should be convinced to be true.

It seems to me that the origin of this whole hate affair with math and physics lies at the way people approach the subject.

Math and physics are taught from the perspective I call ""this thing exists"". This strategy basically pulls a concept out of thin air, plops it in front of students and have them memorize the fact that concept exists in so and so way. Then they plop another concept and explain a rule, that was also pulled out of thin air and also needs to be memorized, that connects both. This goes on and on, until your entire mathematical framework is a collection of impenetrable and incomprehensible rules and jargon.

So it's no surprise people would claim the whole thing is hard and useless. Memorizing abstract rules and weird names is hard, and it feels pointless. Trying to shove real life situations in the middle of that framework is not going to help at all, and it doesn't.

The CORRECT approach should be from the perspective I call ""we need a thing, how do we do it?"". Now, mathematically oriented people will already be complaining to me that ""teaching kids formal proofs? are you nuts?!"" but I'm proposing nothing of the sort.

I think formality should come second to intuition. It's much easier to build formality on top of intuition than intuition on top of formality. Intuition is also more useful, especially in the long term: you may not remember how to compute the area of a circle, but if you remember you can cut a circle into several tiny triangles, you can quickly derive the area yourself.

So, for instance, instead of telling people a circle has 2&pi; radians, show them [why and how to build a radian, and show them how half a circle has around 3.141592... radians](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Circle_radians.gif), and how we can simply call this number &pi; to simplify things. Immediately, it follows that 2&pi; radians cover the whole circle, regardless of the size of the circle.

Want to explain why cos^2 x + sin^2 x = 1? Explain to them [what cosine and sine are in terms of the unit circle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Circle_cos_sin.gif). They'll understand that cosine is the horizontal position of a point at x radians around the circle, and that sine is vertical. They can now immediately understand why sin(&pi;/2) = 1. If they understand this difference between sine and cosine they don't have to remember SOHCAHTOA because it's obvious from the construction.

The entirety of algebra is about creatively doing things to both sides of an equation, usually adding zero and multiplying by one in creative ways. This is ridiculously obvious: if two things are equal, doing the same thing to the two things shouldn't change anything! Nobody has a difficulty with this concept. Instead, people are taught to think of meaningless rules to move symbols around, and the underlying concept of algebra is lost.

Every single concept in math can be taught from this approach (and it is, but formally in higher education). It is not done this way because most of the times the teachers don't fully understand the concepts themselves, and also because the mathematical literature is ripe with regurgitation of old teaching techniques. (Which, I think, it's about time we get rid of and start from scratch with modern tools.)

And mathematicians and physicists are to blame as well. Things are often deliberately made more complicated than they are, almost as a way to show off how much smarter they are than the student who's trying to learn for the first time.

Teachers forget they once were students themselves, and the pitfalls and mistakes they've made. If teachers were a little more self-aware of this, math and physics education would improve tremendously.

(**EDIT**: This last point is what I try to keep at heart when I do my animations. When you finally understand a concept, when something finally clicks in your head, there's usually two responses: excitement, followed by anger. We always think ""Aaahhhhhh! Of course! This is so obvious now!"", and a second later, ""Why the HELL did nobody tell me that from the beginning?"" So I've been telling things how I wanted them to be told from the beginning.)

(**EDIT 2**: also, regarding ""real world applications""/""when will I ever use this?"", [see this other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/3pu3o0/lucasvb_gives_his_answer_to_why_do_people_dislike/cw9ka27) I made over on /r/DepthHub)

So there's a huge amount of variables at play, and unfortunately, they are all in a feedback loop. It goes way beyond math too.

It will be hard to change things overnight, but one way to start is to sell people this simple idea: ***it is fun to figure things out***.

Mathematics is just a puzzle game. People enjoy puzzles and games, one way or the other (all areas of human knowledge are about piecing together a puzzle of some sort.)

They just haven't learned to see the puzzle in math, and they don't know how to play it. It's as if we're teaching people how to paint by showing them famous pictures, or how to compose music by having them listen to music.

If you realize this, it's no surprise people don't enjoy math: they were never taught or allowed to play the game.

[There's a famous text by Paul Lockhart](http://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/mnewman/LockhartsLament.pdf) about how the beauty and fun in math is lost to most people due to poor education. It's too poetical for me, and not exactly offering solutions, but it's well worth a read."
44,TrueAskReddit,Has nonviolent protest lost its effectiveness in the US?,"Honestly, I think the idea that the US has a history of successful, completely non-violent protest is an idea manufactured and championed by the establishment. It's a convenient fantasy that encourages obedience, or at most *slightly inconvenient* disobedience.

[Al Jazeera](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/11/26/american-social-movementshavealwaysincludedriots.html) covers it more eloquently than I ever could, but I'll toss in my additional/derived two cents anyway.

Many of the ""flashpoints"" in American human rights emerged in reaction to and coincident with violent protests, because that's when shit gets real. When people are being mildly inconvenienced, or when people are peacefully assembling, it's actually *very easy to ignore*.

We remember the era of MLK as an era of non-violent protest because that is the most convenient narrative for the establishment. It encourages very slow change with minimal disruption to the status quo.

But that's not the reality. Protests often turned ugly and violent, sometimes white ""counter-rioters"" would pop up and try to (or succeed in) razing black communities to the ground.

I think it's convenient to believe that the same progress would have been made even if the civil rights movement of the 50s/60s had been 100% non-violent. But I really think that, as ugly and horrible as violence is, it raises the stakes and accelerates things.

If a thousand protesters stand quietly in a candle vigil, then that's one thing.

If people's property and investments and companies start getting threatened because *that's how upset the disenfranchised are* then that changes the calculus. Maybe that's a cold, cynical way of looking at the world, but that's how I see it.

46,TrueAskReddit,How can society work around the problem of 'childcare workers deserve a respectable wage' vs 'childcare fees are prohibitively expensive'?,"
One issue that OP's question does not address is the fact that many families are forced to have both parents work due to the high cost of living, and salaries that have not met the rate of inflation for decades. Therefore these families must rely on childcare by default. 

Perhaps we should close tax loopholes and increase the tax rate on corporations such that the additional tax revenue could supplement the cost of childcare for single parent families and the like. Of course this solution doesn't directly address the issue of wage inequality, but it helps to an extent with wealth redistribution. 

I am simply trying to point out the irony behind major corporations being the greatest benefactors of both the highest degree of tax relief, as well as the largest recipients of welfare; in that their employees have to rely on entitlements because the company does not pay a living wage...AND both parents have to work while paying the high cost of childcare. 

Personally I believe that Fully Automated Luxury. Gay Space Communism is the best solution, comrades. "
47,TrueAskReddit,Can hookup culture exist in a meaningful and healthy way for women?,"Hey there,
I'm a 24 yo bi woman who's taken part in hookup culture, as well as polyamorous relationships and long term monogamous relationships.
Over the years I've spent a lot of time analyzing my relationship with sex and intimacy with the various long and short term partners I've had.
The conclusion I've come to, though I don't think casual sex is wrong in any way, I think there is something very intrinsically human that it doesn't satisfy.
I've consentually entered or even instigated casual hookups that I later felt badly about. It was always a strange feeling of having made myself vulnerable or open to someone who couldn't see me as a whole, complex, person. And how could they? They'd only known me for a few days, weeks, hours, and yet we'd done something so intimate that it causes a sort of dissonance. 
I think we all use sex to different ends, but to fulfill something that we feel is lacking in our lives rn - intimacy, safety, thrills, adrenaline, power, escape, self esteem etc. I think western culture has overplayed how important sex is in our lives, and leaves us with a feeling of fomo if we're not having a lot of it, or makes us think that sex can fix a lot more than it can.
My favorite poet, Maggie Nelson, has a great line about it in her book ""Bluets"" - ""fucking leaves everything as it is""
I've had short encounters that were really beautiful and taught me a lot about myself. But that's exactly it - it was about me, not them or ""us"".
I know my experience isn't reflective of everyone. It's just mine. What I've come to believe is that sex, in its nature, is the most physically intimate act two people can partake in. It can also be the most emotionally intimate, and (imo, though I've met a lot of people who disagree) it's unnatural to divorce those two aspects from each other. This doesn't mean that encounters can't be short, but I think it's the dissonance between the physical intimacy and lack of emotional intimacy that leaves a lot of people (not just women, but any people who are sensitive by nature) dissatisfied with hookup culture. "
48,TrueAskReddit,Why would so many powerful people be involved in pedophilia?,"Because *people* are involved in paedophilia.  

There's a few things at work, mind.  

There's almost certainly a shitton of dodgy shit under the surface of middle- and working-class western society as well.  Think about the stat that 1/4 adult women have been exposed to a situation resembling one of Weinsteins' abuses - but the Weinstein abuses are the ones dominating the papers.  Don't subscribe to this as an ""elites"" problem as opposed to a ""people"" problem.  

Content biasing in the media.  There's bigger spotlights on the 'elites', as well as a bigger market for exposes on them.  This results in huge apparent biasing towards what is and isn't reported; paedophilia doubles down on this because the victims are particularly 'newsworthy' and the crimes particularly lurid and shocking.  

Abusers are drawn to positions and environments where they can indulge their nature.  In the case of paedophilia - regular and/or unsupervised contact with young people, positions of trust and authority, and an enabling peripheral network.  Teachers, pastors ... entertainment industry, politics. 

And ... the more secure an abuser is in their position, they more bold their abuses will be.  Feeling like he was powerful enough in Hollywood to stay on top & stifle reporting likely contributed to Weinstein committing more assaults than were he a nobody middle-manager somewhere concerned about his abuses 'getting out'.  

AFIK paedophilia is best understood as a sex orientation, for all that it's a deviant and harmful one.  That means that power isn't going to turn someone normal into a paedo any more than exposure to the Mens Athletic Swim Club turns a straight bloke gay.  The only notable coda to this is that rape and sex abuses are often more about sociocultural/interpersonal 'power' and domination (as opposed to structural, like politics or wealth), in which case the victim selection is less about sex appeal and more about opportunity.  This means someone who is an opportunistic sex abuser but not necessarily ""a paedophile"" might attack a child or youth because they were vulnerable and accessible rather than because they were a kid.  (Weinstein and Woody Allen both reportedly forced themselves on minors, but for different if equivalently horrifying reasons.)"
49,TrueAskReddit,"Why are Western Babyboomers so conservative, despite living through one of the most hedonistic decades of all time?","Assuming you are talking about the 60s, hippies were *not* the majority. That's just tv and movies making you think that. 

Aside from that, it's a general truism that people get more conservative as they age, raise a family, and have some money. 

Basically, the premise of your question is kind of off. "
50,TrueAskReddit,"If scientists discovered that a certain group of people were inherently more violent, less intelligent, or otherwise inferior to everyone else, would it be ethical to suppress that information in order to protect that group from being discriminated against?","I think its important to note that, either way, the entire group would not be less intelligent, more violent, etc. Only the *average* member of the group would be so, and only in comparison to other groups (obviously). What would occur would be an [overlapping distribution of two bell curves.](http://i.imgur.com/hf33f5h.gif) So widespread discrimination would still be unwarranted, because while, for instance, blue-eyed people *in general* might be less intelligent than green-eyed people *in general*, there is zero reason to expect that any *particular* blue-eyed person is less intelligent than any *particular* green-eyed person. That's how statistics work, yet that is lost on most people.

I think it would be ethical to suppress such information, but impractical. It would be much easier to let the information out there but to discredit it and malign the researchers who conducted the studies. If the difference was pronounced enough to be noticeable to even a layperson, then suppressing it would be impossible, and if the difference was smaller than that, discrediting the researchers would be much easier."

Since extrajudicial surveillance is collecting data without a warrant issued by a competent court from probable cause, the gathered evidence could not be used as the basis for a case in a court of law. 

To get around this, some police who used NSA data for drug cases tried [parallel construction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction), which is essentially fabricating or bending the truth as to how evidence was gathered.  Courts do not take kindly to that sort of activity."
53,TrueAskReddit,"Why do people NOT think of tyrants (Pharaohs, Nero, Gilgamesh) the same way they think of Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot?","No one even knows anyone, even in distant memory, who were personally affected by these people, and our substantial cultural apparatus for conveying this sort of information says basically nothing about them, so no childhood associations get formed. Instead you find out in a history text footnote when you're 19 that Gegis Khan killed a bunch of people a billion years ago, and that seems pretty bad, but there's no visceral or personal connection there. "
54,TrueAskReddit,"Sex is natural and humans love it, how/why did it become the taboo that it is today?","Sex is controlled one way or another in the vast majority of social species.  Humans would be quite the exception if we didn't put any boundaries on it.  Many social species limit sex to one or a few individuals...from eusocial species like ants with one reproductive female, to herd species where the dominant male mates and excludes other males, who can reproduce with who is typically limited.  In species that form pairs, like many birds and some fish, either individual of the pair may cheat or attempt to cheat, and this often leads to conflict between, eg, resident male and interloper.  In some species, mating is promiscuous, which means that any individual in the group can mate with any other individual.  Among the great apes, gorillas follow the ""dominant male"" model while both chimps and bonobos are  promiscuous.

So in some sense, you'd expect ""taboo"" around sex because most group-dwelling animals have lots of social control around who mates with who, and attempting to mate in the wrong context can get you attacked.

To bring it back to people in particular, humans follow all sorts of patterns with regard to mating, but there tends to be quite a lot of social control built up around it one way or another.  Humans are a bit unusual among mammals in that males often commit a fair amount of resources to raising their offspring.  For them to do this, they need some assurance the offspring is theirs, and that means societal taboos to restrict sex between non-pair individuals.  From the woman's side, it can be advantageous to prevent one's mate from fathering children elsewhere who might divert resources away from your own offspring.   All these concerns get built up even more in the context of agricultural societies, where marriages are often used to cement alliances between groups.  If the marriage breaks down, it could impact much more than just two individuals.  

From a societal perspective,  there's further incentive to build social controls and taboos around sex.  Because humans pair bond so strongly, emotions run high in matters related to sex.  That can lead to a lot of conflict over who is sleeping with who, which can in turn lead to injuries, feuds, and deaths-especially in societies without legal systems or strong governments that quash that kind of vigilante action.  It's in everyone else's interest that members of society don't go getting in fights or killing each other, and by imposing order you can bring some control to the situation and reduce this issue.

56,TrueAskReddit,What is the problem with cultural appropriation?,"I don’t think it’s inherently a bad thing, but it’s good to talk about it so that we have the language to criticize those instances where it can be. A lot of Buddhist iconography, for example, is often appropriated for marketing (think just about any brand with “Zen” in the title), proliferating a lot of misunderstandings about Buddhism in the West. These misunderstandings can manifest as little errors, like using Nirvana and Heaven interchangeably, but it can maybe lead to others as well - Myanmar’s human rights abuses against the Rohingya have actually been documented for years, but I think they only became front-page news to western audience very recently because for a while we assumed Buddhist populations must all have the sort of calm, peaceful outlook that our marketed fantasy of them has made. On a less directly harmful level, I think there’s some understandable resentment by once-foreign minority groups in the West when some part of their culture that’s very important or even sacred to them becomes a passing fad for the population as a whole with little to no respect for that sanctity.

In the beginning, there was the Kingdom of Judah. We're talking 1000BC-500BC here. Long ass time ago. Anyway, it was ruled by Jews, supposedly beginning with David. It's what one would read about in the Old Testament if one is into that sort of thing. I won't get into it, but the short version of what the Torah will have you believe is that God gives Jews the Holy Land.

Then the Kingdom of Judah gets conquered by the Persians, and then by the Romans. All the stuff one might read about in the New Testament happens in the Roman Empire during this time. The Romans called this chunk of land Palestine. The short version is that Jesus, king of the Jews, does a bunch of stuff in Jerusalem and now Jerusalem is both the holy land of both the Jews and the Christians.

A few hundred years go by, the Roman Empire breaks up and now the Byzantine Empire aka the Eastern Roman Empire aka the Roman Empire (which is what they called themselves more or less, they viewed the breakup of the empire as being a minor territorial dispute) now rules over areas including Jerusalem oh and BTW they're Christian now instead of Roman Mythology, which is too bad because those stories are way more interesting than the holy books of the Abrahamic religions.

Yes, it's important that I give a rundown of most of western history. I told you it's complicated. Does this break rule 4 for commenting? Maybe? Certainly your question can't be answered without giving the background.

Anyway, Mohammad takes over the Arabian penninsula in the 7th century. (not Jerusalem though) During his life, he experiences a one night journey where he visits ""the farthest mosque"". (I'm paraphrasing here, and Muslims aren't supposed to paraphrase Mohammad, but I'm not Muslim so I don't care. Google ""isra miraj"".) Islamic scholars are in broad agreement that ""the farthest mosque"" is Jerusalem, even if such agreement is on somewhat shaky theological foundations. Most notably, there weren't any Muslims in Jerusalem, let alone Mohammad, so there's that. But it doesn't matter; now Jerusalem is Islam's holy land too.

After Mohammad died, the government he created didn't die with him. Nor the religion of course. At this point, the government and the religion is kind of the same thing, and takes over a lot of land. Including Jerusalem. A few hundred years later, the Pope decides This Will Not Stand, and begins the Crusades. The Crusades are their own complicated topic, but all you need to know is that from the Islamic perspective, were Peak Catholic Assholery. Although there were a few individuals who really cared about recapturing the holy land, but mostly it was about looting and pillaging. They sacked, looted, and pillaged Constantinople, which was Catholic at that point. It was a shitshow, you didn't want to live in Constantinople at that point. They also looted and pillaged everything else they came across too, but the point is, they sacked, looted, and pillaged Constantinople, which was the (Catholic) Byzantine Empire's capital.

...which left the Byzantine Empire open to being conquered by the Muslims. Which it was. Despite the fact that the crusaders basically gave the Muslims Constantinople and the rest of modern day Turkey, they were still really salty about getting looted, raped, and pillaged for 200 odd years.

This was pretty much the status quo for several hundred years with regards to Jerusalem. The Ottoman Empire took over, and there were squabbles about land in other places, notably Spain and Eastern Europe, but all was pretty quiet in Jerusalem. The Ottoman Empire had plenty of border squabbles, but for the most part, they were pretty good about letting local ethnic communities take care of their own shit. If there were towns, villages, or communities within larger cities of Jews or Christians or Coptics or whatever living wherever, even in Jerusalem, and they kept order and paid their taxes, the Ottomans left them alone.

Meanwhile, the Jews were having a pretty shitty time in the West, including Europe and Russia. (I'm finally starting to get to the point) Think Jim Crow but different. Systematic, institutionalized prejudice prevented them from owning land or voting etc. A lot of Jews were talking about making their own nation-state comprised entirely of Jews. Not a whole lot of traction was gained though; things were bad, but they weren't *that* bad. Still, the voices were loud. This philosophy was (and still is) called Zionism -- the establishment of a nation-state of Jews, ideally located in the Jewish holy land, Israel. (which hadn't been a thing for 2000 years)

WWI happens. The Ottoman Empire sides with the Central Powers. (aka the losing side) The Ottoman Empire is overrun during the course of the war, the country is broken up and parceled out. (go watch Lawrence of Arabia) Jerusalem becomes part of the British Empire. Some Muslims view this as a continuation of the Crusades. The rest of the Central Powers are instituted with limp-dick governments and a mandate to repay tremendous sums of money to the victors.

Germany ends up an economic shitshow. Hyperinflation happens, basically everything turns to shit. Adolf Hitler rose to power, blames the Jews, pograms and stuff happens. WWII happens, the Holocaust, etc. Hitler is eventually defeated.

The US is still fighting Japan for another year, France becomes a country again and is dealing with their own problems, and Britain and Russia are mostly cleaning up Hitler's mess. The Jews, for the most part, are like fuck this shit I'm out. But where do you go? Well, they've been hearing crazy Uncle Avi rant about wanting to move to Israel for about five decades. And they want to go fucking *anywhere*, and guess what, Britain is like, ""fine, you can go to Israel"" since they owned it, and didn't want to be accused of mistreating Jews in the aftermath of the Holocaust. So lots of Jews move to Israel.

Here's the thing about the Jews going to Israel: it isn't just a migration, it's a cultural movement. Hebrew, a dead language for 2000 years, is resurrected, and becomes an unofficial language. The Jews form their own government system, with de facto local leaders, (although no official authority or sovereignty) and petition the British government to become their own countries. Their Arab neighbors, with their own de facto leaders without official authority view this as kind of a joke, because they've been making the same arguments, even to the point of armed insurrection, since the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, which again, they view as a continuation of the crusades, with Christians coming in and looting and pillaging. Britain can't deal with trying to put down a Jewish rebellion, both because of the PR thing (what with the Holocaust and all that) and because they have to rebuild their own country and because the Korean War is happening. Britain's internal politics are a shitshow, and Britain's superpower status is wavering. Hard.

So Britain gives the Israeli authorities sovereignty. And the Arab authorities lose their shit. Civil war starts. The short version is that Israel wins, and effectively controls most of the land. So now it's 1950 and Israel has become its own real country effectively out of nowhere in about three years. There are a handful of Arabs who live there, but for the most part, they're outnumbered in Israel by a significant margin, and the displaced people in the refugee camps never really had any real assets to begin with. Israel has an open immigration policy for Jews, and they experience significant immigration over the coming decades.

In 1956, Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal. (google Suez Crisis) This angered Britain and France. Britain and France talk Israel into invading Egypt, in exchange for aid. From a military standpoint, this succeeds, but it's a political shitshow. There's widespread outrage in the British public for starting another fucking war, the US is pissed because it jeopardized anti-communist agendas in other places, (Egypt was ostensibly a relatively friendly state to the US) basically it goes poorly. Britain is oil-strapped because of the loss of the Suez Canal, Britain goes to the IMF for help, the US shuts them down, Saudi Arabia embargoes Britain for oil, and the US supports them. Britain, France, and Israel pull out. But the damage is already done. Israel isn't just a stain on the map, Israel is now actively a threat to the sovereignty of Egypt, in their mind.

Tensions are high. Israel is in a bad economic and political position, they don't have aid from anyone, they can't buy weapons from any country except France, and France has shitty weapons. The remaining Arabs in Israeli controlled lands aren't doing so well, they can't go to other Arab countries because those countries aren't accepting refugees, it's a shitshow. Meanwhile, Israel is building settlements in lands inhabited by Arabs for the massive influx of Jews who want their own Jewish homeland."

In the UK it's had pretty wide coverage but barely any focus on the nationality of the passengers other than the Chinese, primarily because china was kicking up such a fuss.

I see the reasons as:

1) This is the first time a plane has gone missing with so many people on board. If you look at all previous missing plane examples, the highest number of missing passengers has been well short of the MH370 roster.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aerial_disappearances

Of course if MH370 is found, it'll be removed from this list.

2) We're in an era of mass instant media. A plane going missing 20 years ago wouldn't have received nearly as much instant and persistent global attention.

3) The circumstances have been so utterly unique to any other missing aircraft case or indeed any crashed and discovered aircraft. At the start it seemed like daily events would contradict the previous day's news. This alone simply kept it in the news, because each day brought new news.

Nothing really more to add.

Edit: Actually I would like to add another point....

The only solution I see, short of laws being enacted (which would be a wasp nest of free speech issues), is a major effort to educate the public about critically evaluating news and information, drawing from multiple reputable sources, and evaluating arguments with logical rigor.

But, at least in the United States, the very people in charge of making this kind of educational push feasible are arguably those people who benefit most from having an uninformed, gullible public. Not to put too fine a point on it, shit’s bleak."
65,TrueAskReddit,How will the world be different post coronavirus?,"I can say confidently that:  

* There will be many closed businesses and it will take a while for the economy to recover. 
* Many jobs will be changed entirely or mostly to work from home. Many more will retain at least partial work from home structure. It's a hell of a lot harder for a boss to say it's not possible for a couple days when it's been done for months.
* Social contact is likely to be much reduced for a long time. Fewer handshakes, hugs, or kisses on the cheek in greeting.

I hope, but am not at all confident that: 

* ~~Wet~~ markets will be shut down Edit: Live wild animal markets to be more specific, thanks /u/Awarth_ACRNM 
* Essential workers will be able to get the minimum wage raised to be paid a living wage for their, as we have discovered, truly essential work. 
* Public perception of workers in jobs that are not glamorous will remain raised after the pandemic ends. 
* Healthcare will be uncoupled from work. The huge unemployment coupled with coronavirus pandemic quickly showed that in the interest of public health, we need people to have healthcare available to them whether they are working or not. 

I expect, but hope we can avoid:

* Consolidation of businesses. I expect these large businesses that can weather the downturn or have enough influence to get a government bailout will buy out or simply take the place of smaller businesses that were unable to survive. I would expect more oligopolies taking advantage of customers in the next decade 
* The rich get richer. The wealthy will have plenty to buy up devalued assets just like they did with the '08 crash. Wealth inequality will get a huge boost.
* Many people laid off during the pandemic will not get jobs back or their jobs will have a pay cut. Companies that lay off thousands will discover that they can pay people less to work from home or that they only need hundreds to do what they previously needed thousands for thanks to technology that was available, but not implemented before the pandemic forced it."
66,TrueAskReddit,Why don't novelists ever rewrite other novels in the same way that musicians cover songs or film-makers remake films?,"People reimagine familiar stories all of the time. At least the early Harry Potter books are full of old fantasy tropes. This isn't even a shot at J.K Rowling, because it's pretty standard for fantasy and sci-fi to borrow from previous work. The number of fantasy worlds with human sized elves (using that spelling), halflings and dwarves speaks to that. 

Another example; My wife started reading ""1984"" after reading ""The Hunger Games,"" and was shocked at the number of things Hunger Games that are basically lifted straight from the earlier work. They would be familiar to anyone who has seen or read any kind of dystopia fiction.

I think what Shakespeare did was really closer to making a movie adaptation of a book. He took existing stories and put them on stage with his own flavor.

Copyright is a big reason why a random writer can't put out the exact same book, and many authors walk a very fine line when it comes to ripping off more recent work (including Rawling, who faced some plagarism criticisms and lawsuits). 

As someone else said, film is based on the visual. Look at Baz Luhrman's ""Romeo & Juliet"" - he didn't re-write the words at all, he just made it look cool and added some music. It was purely what it looked like that made it different. Then there's foreign film remakes because non-English foreign films don't draw a big audience in the U.S. Direct re-makes don't happen that often; the last one I can think of is ""Psycho,"" and that isn't terribly well regarded.

Re-writing a book just doesn't make sense. The closest thing may be updating the language of an older story, which has been done with ancient works, but why would you read a re-written copy of a book that already exists?"
67,TrueAskReddit,Why is it that people must go through years of paperwork to adopt a child but go through none to have one?,"A child up for adoption is ridiculously vulnerable and hence protected by regulation. But you can't stop people popping 'em out for themselves.

70,TrueAskReddit,If this wasn't a pandemic but a global social experiment - what have we learnt about ourselves as individuals and about us as a species?,"As a species:

Information should be shared truthfully, even if it damages you because in the end a lie can be far more devastating in a globally connected society.

As individuals:

The time we work per day is too much, we can be as productive in a smaller time period and from home--->happiness makes more productive.

 Our jobs should be here as entertainment in a senseless world. We need work for self-worth, but not to ""just"" survive. Happiness isn't found in doing a lot of work but rather in doing what you want and in the modern era that's actually a glimpse of hope that in the near future a big part of the population can ""self-fulfill"". We realise, I realised, that I need work. But not to survive, but to live life to its fullest.

The lenient sentencing that was common in the 90's that was practised in exchange for an exchange of technical expertise with the state could be compared with the 'letter of marque' which was given to privateers as a form of state sanctioned piracy. Now it's more common to see harsh sentences being given out because hacking has become an in-house practise rather than an outsourced one.

For example, one program that I recommend highly works with young blind people to become entirely independent over the course of about a year. You get mobility and travel training, advocacy skills training, life skills, braille. The programs are designed to fit the individual need of the person. I would also advise that your mom help to put him in touch with independent successful blind mentors.

75,TrueAskReddit,What would the effect of total drug legalization be?,"As a recovering addict with over two years clean and as a felon convicted of dealing MJ, I think I'm well qualified to answer this question. 

First, there are millions of felons in the USA and most are non violent offenders like myself. Legalizing drugs would greatly reduce the stigma associated with past drug dealing / drug convictions. Many felons cannot find decent work or housing because of their records. This causes many of them to ""get back in the game"" so to speak and commit further crimes. It causes others to break down and end up in mental wards. More become homeless. This is highly detrimental, both to the felon himself and the community at large. If drugs were legalized, within a decade, or less, past drug convictions would have little effect on one's search for work or housing. Following legalization, more bills would likely be passed erasing / expunging the criminal records of non violent drug offenders. This would benefit society as a whole, allowing many hundreds of thousands to find jobs and pay taxes and reform themselves and better their own lives and their family's lives and their community as well. There are geniuses out there that can't contribute to society because they made a mistake and got themselves addicted to one drug or another and then committed a crime to support that addiction. This makes little sense. 

But it's not that easy. If drugs were legalized, a lot of people in recovery would use again / relapse. A lot of young people in their twenties would have easy access to opiates - the wort drug IMO -  physically addictive and utterly enslaving, and they would lose years of their lives like i did, and they would be destroyed financially, the would lose their friends and ultimately their families, and their potential recovery would be that much more difficult because they wouldn't have to drive to the awful neighborhoods to score, they could just go to Walmart. Obviously others would find other terrible substances like meth or coke or benzos. Just look at all the alcoholics out there. We all know some. Being an alcoholic may be less stigmatized than being a heroin addict, but alcohol kills much quicker than opiates. 

Ultimately, legalizing all drugs would be good for a number of entities - the government (taxes, reduced enforcement and prison costs, less powerful cartels) - corporations (manufacturing and selling the drugs) - and the public at large (less petty crime from addicts trying to support their habit and less violent crime associated with drug trafficking). But it would be negative for the people using the hard stuff. There is only darkness ahead for them regardless of the legality. The inevitable price drop would only get people more addicted than when they were paying 100$ a day on their habit and would subsequently cause more overdoses. 

My final word on the manner - legalize marijuana completely. Allow hallucinogenics like LSD, mushrooms, and DMT to be purchased from behind the counter at pharmacies if the person is approved to take them by a doctor (not a prescription, a statement of mental competency). Keep opiates and amphetamines and benzos prescription only, and allow MDMA to be prescribed as well. Decriminalize small, personal use amounts of all the hard drugs (heroin, cocaine, meth, etc.) there is no reason to throw a drug addict in jail. Provide treatment instead. "
76,TrueAskReddit,Is 2020 going to be marked in the history books as the end of the golden age of the west?,"[Ray Dalio has published an analysis of the major empires and world powers for the past 500 years.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycles-over-last-500-years-ray-dalio/)  It's interesting reading, and I'm not an economist or history buff but a lot of his arguments make sense to me.

77,TrueAskReddit,"TEACHERS who have taught in multiple cultures, how do the students behavior compare?","Before I start writing a bunch, just know that this answer is purely anecdotal from my personal experience teaching in a few different areas. I taught for about a year in America, three in South Korea, and one in Spain. The experiences were, of course, much different from each other, but the conclusions I've come to for 'why' surprised me when I took my preconceived notions of some of these cultural stereotypes and challenged them with real life experience.

Your question specifically mentions the Asian student stereotype. I'd say from my experience that, yes, my Asian students were much more disciplined and respectful in the classroom. This is due to a variety of factors. The buzzword is CULTURE, but that can even be broken down more.
Within Asian (specifically in this case, Korean) culture, status and age plays a big role not just in treatment of people around you, but also the language you use to communicate with those people. I'm sure you've heard of honorifics and politeness within these cultures, but I find that not many people I talk to understand HOW ingrained this is in the culture and specifically LANGUAGE. The words are different when you speak up or down to someone, not simply the way in which you say them. In other words, it's a lot more like actual word conjugation than tone change.
 If you ever find yourself in Asia, notice that people will ask you about your age A LOT. It's not because they're personally curious, but it's just something you have to know in order to communicate properly.

Ok sorry, I digress: In this way, the students know that they are students and the teachers know that they are teachers and there is a respect for authority that gets challenged a lot in a western classroom. There, if a kid is disrespectful in class, he/she is sent out and loses the learning opportunities for that time period. If this happens a lot, learning suffers,. Not to mention backlash from parents, administration, etc. In America it's about punishing the student in order to dissuade them from committing the disruption again; in Korea, the simple denial of education (more on this topic in the next paragraph) is a the punishment in itself and people WILL shape up, or fail. 


Another factor I'd like to suggest is the pressure and social impact of school life. In Korea, at least, you prepare your whole life for a test (수능) that people compare to a SAT or ACT. But it's much, much more than that. I'd say that I cared about the ACT for about 1.5 years leading up to it in High School. In Korea, if you don't get into a good elementary school in order to get to a good middle school, in order to get to a good high school to prepare you for the test, it's a really big deal. It ALL leads there. And if you don't do well... I believe that these days you get one more chance (I'm not sure about the retake aspect) but it is a shame issue, and your university and job prospects all hinge on your performance in this test.

Now, in America, we have socially changed the game as far as equal opportunity and second (and third and fourth...) chances to perform. Think about test retakes, special test-taking accommodations, etc. You can take the ACT as many times as you want and just go with the score you like best. Or, many universities don't care about your score anyway (etc.) so just show them your other attributes that make you a good university candidate. These sorts of opportunities DO NOT EXIST (as far as I've seen) in Korea. You perform on the test or you do not, and that's the end of that.
In a similar vein of educational opportunity: kids know from a young age that they will not be specially helped if they fall behind so it is their responsibility to keep up. To westerners this might have two responses. One being: but what if there are factors outside their control, they deserve to be properly educated!! Two being: Good, they have to be motivated to work and they'll sink or swim, and that's how it should be.
I had students in third grade, the age that formal English education starts in public school, who were already far enough behind that they gave up because nobody was coming back for them-- they didn't build a foundation so they were lost. 

All this to say that I believe the answer to your question is that in Asia, things are higher stakes because there is less accommodation for anything other than the best. If you fall behind, you stay behind literally for the rest of your life. And it's a rut that's hard to get out of. OP, you asked about things like teacher quality, and parents: They are strict and relentless, but it's not unusual in this situation. Imagine being a parent in this culture where if you watch your child fall behind, they literally lose opportunities that will shape the rest of their lives. When you realize this, you can begin to understand their attitudes and strictness for their children.


And a brief note if you're curious: I found Spain's educational climate to be much more similar to America's, although I was teaching in a very gifted bilingual public school with very motivated and skilled students, so it's hard to compare. However I will say that though the students there had less 'respect for authority' than I saw in Korea, it is America where the students really push teachers' buttons and test the boundaries of what is and is not allowed. It would be irresponsible to lay all the blame here, but I do think that in our society -right now- we have a lot of unaccountability within our popular culture and media; a lot of action without consequence. And maybe it seems too direct to link those topics together, but I'd say they are inextricably linked. Other places I've been teaching, consequence is swift and brutal. Here, chances are handed out willy-nilly, and punishments are either way too harsh for their crime or simply a handslap. 



If you have any other specific questions, I'm happy to chat. Once again, keep in mind that these are my personal experiences and opinions about the questions you asked, and this question is something that could, with anecdotal answers like mine, have wildly different outcomes."
78,TrueAskReddit,"Are there things banned from American internet, like how we hear about things getting banned in China?","A lot of people have mentioned child pornography, but also, copyrighted material is one of the closest items to actually being 'scrubbed'.

80,TrueAskReddit,"Is it the goal of humanity to ultimately be surpassed by artificial intelligence? In other words, if AI eventually become superior to humans from a functional standpoint, should we accept that AI are better than human beings and accept them taking over as the superior lifeform?","I have two competing impulses here. On the one hand I think there's something kind of beautiful in imagining humanity as the scaffolding for something even more incredible, to think that nature has such an upward direction. I also harbor hope that if we created true AI they would not be malevolent, as I don't see any reason for them to be. On the contrary it seems to me likely that they would take care of us, even as an afterthought. I read somewhere once the observation that fish didn't get on land by inventing reverse-diving gear, they got onto land by evolving into something else. And then, lo and behond, given enough time their ancestors came back and made habitats for them on land. Similarly, it looks like it'll be impossible for humanity as it is to ever really spread through the stars. But perhaps our AI children may be able to work the superscience to create giant ark ships, or even dimensional gateways or something who knows, to spread humanity to new worlds, the same way we spread fish in our fish bowls. Perhaps simply because it will amuse them to have us around. And when that day comes the human race will basically be retired. Which brings it's own existential questions.

My competing impulse is that this is a terrible vision of the future, not to mention incredibly unlikely. More likely is that there is no true upward arrow of nature and we're simply a strange quirk of nature quickly proving itself unfit for longevity, wrecking the ecosystem that created us, and this kind of technofuturist daydreaming only serves to make us acquiese to those impulses. No need to worry about the future when daddy AI will come and set everything right. In this mood I feel we need to drastically reshape our priorities as a species. To focus on sustainability and happiness instead of constant growth. To realize that we're pretty close already to the point where our species could retire. If only we would work towards it directly.

81,TrueAskReddit,Would it be possible to elevate every country on earth to 1st world status? Or does the existence of 1st world countries mean that there has to be 2nd and 3rd world countries as well?,"As others have noted, ""first/second/third"" world actually mean ""america+allies, communists, and unaffiliated"" respectively, but obviously first and third have persisted in modern usage as approximately meaning ""rich and poor"" or ""more developed and less developed"". 

*You know what OP means, calling him on semantics isn't useful*

So, the actual question: ""Is it possible for every country to enjoy an average standard of living comparable with that of the US or western Europe?""

I think the answer may be no simply from an ecological perspective - the Earth doesn't have the resources to support the whole current population at that level, even renewables don't regenerate quickly enough to feed that kind of demand. According to the people who release studies about that sort of thing, there's not actually enough capacity to support the world as it is now; we just haven't run through all the reserves yet.

I suspect (but don't know) that it would also be difficult to maintain a 'first world' standard of living without using cheap labour from overseas to make the consumer goods we love so much. Without that, things would have to be substantially more expensive and hence less disposable. No bad thing, but something of a change."
82,TrueAskReddit,Why are we still talking about Snowden?,I agree that the coverage of the actual leaks is being more or less ignored by mainstream media.

83,TrueAskReddit,Was 2016 actually terrible for celebrity deaths? Is it confirmation bias? Or are we at a strange threshold of global celebrity culture and the average human lifespan?,I think this year just had more notable deaths. More people might be more likely to take notice.

84,TrueAskReddit,"If a person is sent to prison for a crime in the past, but now laws criminalizing the act are rescinded, would it be right for the person to serve out their term, or should their sentence be revisited and reevaluated based on the law today?","There's already a re-sentencing process in place for prisoners who would receive lighter sentences under changed laws (especially ""three strikes"" drug laws resulting in life imprisonment).  It's not automatic, though.  The prisoner has to file an appeal, and the appeal has to be reviewed by a court to determine how the changed law applies to the case.  Appellate courts usually don't re-try the entire case to prove guilt or innocence - they look at flaws and changes in the sentencing process.  If the sentencing policy (such as ""three strikes"") is no longer valid or doesn't fit acceptable standards, the appellate court will require the sentencing judge to re-sentence the prisoner in accordance with the current policy.  A nonviolent offender with no prior convictions whose only crime was possession of a small amount of marijuana would likely have their sentence quickly lifted on appeal after legalization.  

But legalization doesn't mean that *drug dealing* is suddenly legal.  Even after legalization, there are limits on the sale and possession of marijuana.  Unlicensed sales, or possession of large amounts of marijuana, or running an unlicensed grow op would *still* be illegal, and a prisoner would still have to serve time for them."

86,TrueAskReddit,"If society were to collapse, what would be some ways to get by?","1) You need a bug out spot. 

Wherever you are, you probably share sources of food and water with quite a few other people. Due to desperation from scarcity, this will need to change immediately because desperate people, while having all of my empathy and still being human beings, can also be dangerous. 

Go to the place where water and food are difficult for most but not impossible for you. I have a bug out bag, but more importantly I have a series of bug out spots I can get to that other people largely know nothing about and that aren't easy places to set up a settlement. You need those, too. Don't tell people about them, never post them online. 

You need fresh water, you need land on which to hunt and/or fish, you need land that can be developed for agriculture, you need land far from collapsing civilization, you need land others are unlikely to want or find. 
_____________________________
2) You need supplies. 

Grow a garden. Like right now. Maybe you have a big yard and you can grow tons of crops, maybe you have a windowsill and some pots, but learn to not only grow your own food, but how to select and save seeds. I have seeds in storage right now that go back to plants I bought 20 years ago. I have really good heirloom tomatoes I've selected for many generations. I have peppers, I have pumpkins, I have green beans, I have more. You can store seeds through the cold months and plant them when it's appropriate every year, you can learn about soil health and irrigation, you can learn about planting plans and the sun, and you can even learn about growing in different zones and what's seasonal based on geography. 

(Oh, and grab a few planting potatoes on your way out of town, they're invaluable.)

Have a basic bug out bag, but also be able to load up your vehicle with basic tools, inside and outdoor. An ax and sharpener alone are invaluable, imagine adding to that other tools like saws and manual drills and picks and shovels and such. 

Have a way to clean water, including the ability to cook, which means pots and pans that can deal with fire and are easy to move. 

Bring light foodstuff that will be difficult to find elsewhere like salt and spices and oils. 

If you're a meat-eater, and you should probably consider it for the nutrition, you'll want trapping and hunting gear. 
_____________________________
3) You need skills. 

Grow food, hunt food, clean water, protect yourself, build a shelter. These are non-negotiable. 

Growing a garden will help to get you off on the right foot, but agriculture for sustenance growing is a completely different scale than most people's gardening hobbies. You need to think about how to grow different foods in different climates. You need to think about nutritional variety, not just growing a few crops but many crops so that you have a wide variety of micronutrients and so you don't get bored with your food. Rice and beans are amazing, but you need vegetables and fruit and nuts and seeds. You need to be able to, in the wilderness, create a healthy loam for your crops. You need pest control. You need irrigation. You need to plan out saving for the winter months. 

Hunting and trapping similarly are complex skills, requiring experience. I don't eat a lot of meat myself, I don't think the keeping and killing of animals is particularly ethical, but I can built traps for animals and I know how to keep and breed animals like rabbits or poultry. Know how to make a snare. Don't rely on a rifle or other firearm, because you will eventually run low on ammunition and frankly you need that for what I'm going to talk about in a minute. 

Water can be cleaned a number of ways depending on possible contaminants. Boiling will kill most pathogens, but it won't even remotely deal with issues like salt or lead, which means distillation (collecting water vapor) could be necessary. There are now survival filtration systems that are really good, but none with which I'm familiar last forever. Same with tablets. 

Protecting yourself can mean predatory and scavenging animals, but it can also mean other humans. In the incredibly depression scenario you're describing, otherwise good and noble people could find themselves choosing between death and the exploitation and harming of others, leading them to make an impossible choice one way or another. There are different schools of thought on this, but many people believe in the right to defend one's self with deadly force. You'll have to decide this for yourself, but should you decide deadly force can be necessary, you'll need to know how to use weapons built to kill. This almost must include firearms. The go-to defense and hunting firearm for survival is rifles, as shotguns and handguns are generally better are shorter distances. Wherever you are, I can guarantee there's a shooting range nearby and classes to instruct on the safe and responsible use of firearms. 

Shelter. Like many of the others, this will have to be done in phases. Phase 1 is short-term, to protect from animals, pests, people, and weather. Think of a hut or a tent built quite near to a fire you can keep going. Phase 2 is seasonal, meaning something that can survive the heat of summer or the cold of winter. Phase 3 is permanent, which usually means a cabin. 
_____________________________
4) You need people. 

No person is an island and even the most introverted and anti-social among us need other people around for their mental and social wellbeing. If you don't have a close group of friends or family with which you know you could survive, you have a job to accomplish over the next few months or years. 

I've done solo survival before, and while one can steel themselves and make busy... eventually isolation becomes torture. Maybe it's your partner, maybe it's a few best friends, maybe it's parents and/or siblings, but have people you can bring and which whom you can live even under stressful circumstances. Collectively you must be stronger than the sum of your parts, to shoulder the burden of such a radical change in living. 
_____________________________

People fantasize about collapse all the time, but I find it tremendously depression and frightening. The scale of suffering of a civilization going from thriving to desperate is unimaginable, and it will multiply itself as the remnants scavenge what's left of itself. 

Let's do everything we can to address the problems with civilization so we can improve and become more sturdy over time, and so we never have to face collapse. "
87,TrueAskReddit,Why does it seem that western society has such an issue with isolation and mental health? What is the solution?,"I've lived in three developing countries and having grown up in a Western society, I feel I can answer this question. 

Western cultures are work-based and emphasizes self-improvement. There is a lot of thought that if someone is keeping you behind, lose them. You tend to judge people on their merit, and if they cannot keep up, it's ""all-fpr-yourself"" mentality. 

That goes for almost every aspect of life. Family members gorging on food and ruining your diet? Eat alone. Friend cannot keep up as a running partner? Run alone. Feeling like your classmates don't understand the material as fast as you? Study alone. You enjoy your job and feel like your spouse is being needy? It's perfectly fine to dump her and concentrate on your career. Partner cannot take vacation at the same time as you? Go on holiday alone, forget them. Have to focus on your work and your friend is distracting you? Tell them to go away. 

It's all about your own happiness, your own happiness, your own happiness. 

Socializing in the West has also been synonymous with ""performing"" as well - we feel like we need to be entertaining or worth the fun in order to socialize. Socializing is an EVENT. It's not just a part of life. Every time we socialize, we need to have ""news"" to share, otherwise....why bother? We have to have interesting conversations in order to be bothered to be around people. We have forgotten that most of life is mundane and we don't want to share that mundane part of us all the time. Even on social media, it's the same - highlights only. 

In developing countries, people are not as work-based (economic reasons). That leaves a lot of time to hang out, chat, chill, loiter, smoke.....I've been in North Africa, Middle East, Mediterranean, East Asia - people always do things together. They wait for other people. Even small tasks like - going to the store - people go together. In the West - ""it's faster if I just do it alone."" A lot of daily life is based off of helping others, instead of ""taking responsibility for yourself."" 

We spend too much time working on ourselves, being self-absorbed, trying to be independent, responsible, self-sufficient - then we end up lonely. "
88,TrueAskReddit,"If Democracy requires a sufficiently educated populace, what form of government is best for an uneducated populace?","Theocracy.  Set down an unarguable set of rules mixed with a moral code and ""divine doctrine"" that plays on emotions (fear and awe largely) and you have a system of populace control that is beneficial in the short term until times are better and the populace more educated.  In more primitive times one could argue that the human race was better off under, and maybe even needed, theocratic rule, because the rules helped moderate the animal nature and establish rules for basic hygiene and civilization.  It becomes obsolete over time, however."
89,TrueAskReddit,"If Republican = small gov, shouldn't they support gay marriage?","Because the US has only two major parties (this is due to [Duverger's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law) and the FPTP voting system in the US), the parties tend to be coalitions. While the Republican Party of the latter half of the 20th century tended to be known for ""small government,"" these days it is only one constituent group. The Republican party also has a large contingent called the ""religious right,"" which strongly favors traditionalist values. Generally, the ""small government"" conservatives focus on economic policy and cede social policy to the religious group.

Additionally, with the rise of the alt-right and Trumpism, even the ""small government"" economic philosophy is disappearing from the Republican party. In fact this has been happening for a while; the philosophical ivory-tower component of US conservative thought has always been at odds with ""the base"" who really have never cared about small government except when it benefited them."
90,TrueAskReddit,"Healthcare professionals, what are the gaps in technology that were uncovered in this pandemic?","This isn't a new one, but:

91,TrueAskReddit,"It is often said that humans are by nature social animals, but why do so many people today struggle with socializing and forming relationships/making friends?","It’s more suitable to say humans are *tribal* animals. We have very strong instincts and predispositions for an “us and them” mentality. Throughout our evolution, we have thrived in small groups with similar genetic profiles. We have ingrained behavior to want to support humans that are like us, and to be skeptical or downright aggressive towards those not like us. I would rather provide food and shelter to someone who may be my distant cousin, because they share more of my genetic makeup than someone from another tribe.

Apparently our definition of “like us” is solidified in early development, so the types of people you’re exposed to early on you will be more accepting of. That may be part of why “city folk” are more accepting of immigrants and social justice than people from rural areas with homogenous populations."
92,TrueAskReddit,"Is classical music objectively one of the most musically complex and technically demanding genres of music to ever exist? Is the idea that classical music being inherently ""superior"" from a music theory standpoint justifiable?","Well, I would say that objectively, orchestral music (as opposed to ""classical"" music, which arguably only covers the music written between approximately 1730 and 1820 - Mozart was the peak of that period, coming after Bach but before Beethoven) from all eras is ONE of the most musically complex and technically demanding genres ever. The reason why is because, as a composer, you cannot just sit at the piano and plunk out some notes - you have to master the art of orchestration, which is the difference between an artist drawing a building and an engineer figuring out how to build it, make it stable and functional, and keep it within a budget. The great orchestrators who are still known today are not just the best engineers, they are also the ones who pushed the limits of the ensemble and the forms of the day into new territory, taking incredible chances (that didn't always work out in their time. See: Stravinsky's disastrous debut of Rite of Spring) and expanding what is generally acceptable to an average listener. 

These people are thinking about dozens of factors that are difficult to keep from crashing into each other, including instrument limitations (most wind instruments only have about a two octave range of practical usability, along with other technical limitations (can't write fast passages between low Bb and B for the average trombone, for example)), low interval limits, what the volume is in real life of a part that says ""Violin II"" and how that balances with everything else, considering you only have a single Violin II part on your score but 8 players on stage, physical distance between percussion parts (as an average percussionist switches between multiple pieces per tune), how a non-mechanically-timed section is to be communicated to all players, transposing instruments, chord scale clashes, the list goes on and on. 

And because they can rarely know ahead of time exactly who will be playing their part, do they assume they'll have players who can execute all of their ideas in perfect time, with perfect intonation (which becomes harder and harder once you get into the music of, say, Bartok), etc etc? Those players have to be technically perfect for every note, and require the highest caliber performer who has dedicated their lives to their instrument.

Or, do they assume they'll have lesser caliber players, and hold back on their writing? The great composers wrote without limitation, and we are better off because of it, but over several centuries the average instrumentalist is now required to masterfully play everything from baroque music to post-modern pointilistic music with no real tonal center. If you are a trumpet player playing Beethoven, you only have 3-4 notes to deal with, because he wrote for straight trumpets, which predated valved trumpets, but you have to nail those notes. In the same concert you may have to play a Schoenberg piece that uses every note on your horn, and where you almost never repeat the same note twice in a row.

Jazz took this to a new level by requiring improvisation on various levels, but there's a reason why [Duke Ellington insists he had a jazz orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhpqIMor2P8) (rather than a band or something). It only took a few decades for jazz to evolve to a point of crossing paths with classical music (the ""third stream"" as they called it in the late 40s and 50s), and now you have one of the most successful and influential jazz groups, Maria Schnider's Orchestra, full of symphony-caliber players.

Sorry to ramble, what I'm getting at is that yes, orchestral music from every era, but almost certainly even more so in the 20st century, is objectively SOME of the most complex and technically demanding genre of music to ever exist. And this is coming from a rock and pop fan, to my core, but almost no rock or pop has similar amounts of technical complexity. Even the most complex rock bands, say, Dream Theater, who was mentioned in this thread, only deal with five instruments, of which only four have notes to deal with, and of which all of them have very wide ranges and similar/flexible timbres. There is a physical technicality involved and I couldn't possibly downplay the time signatures and phrasing and non-Ionian scales involved, plus the fact that it's straight up good music. But if the question is about comparing anything else to orchestral music, orchestral almost always wins in terms of being the peak of western musical accomplishment, as it's a combination of both pure musicality and undeniable masterly technical ability.


Oh, and to comment on Gould, who I also love, I think I disagree somewhat with his sentiment. I would need a historian to step in, because I don't know about the average persons musical knowledge in the 19th century and earlier (my gut tells me that only the upper class trained their own, while the lower class dealt more with folk music, but I might be oversimplifying things). In general though, nowadays, as long as we continue to require several years of music in elementary school years and possibly even music appreciation type classes in college years, our musical literacy will do just fine. The thing is, with the tools we have now (Pandora, Spotify, Youtube, iPods, etc), it's very easy to learn about things. The hard part is A) There is SO MUCH music these days that it's impossible to master all of it, as previous generations were able to accomplish, or get close to, and B) The downside of easy access to music makes it just as easy to not engage with it past a superficial level (how many of you know people who only listen to a type of music when it's on in the background of studying or or cleaning?)

Ok, giant post, gotta stop now.

There's no easy answer for you, but it definitely doesn't have to do with free speech or anything like that. Language is an organic, evolving thing, and people use it how they use it.

He should have said, ""Russia have no chance of winning a conventional, non-nuclear, war against the West"". In that, he is correct, they would lose, which is why they will not start one. Even if the US did not involve itself, and it was Russia vs Western Europe, my money would be on Western Europe. 

Russian conventional forces are not at the level that they were at at the time of the cold war, their fleet is a collection of poorly maintained vessels, which limits their expeditionary capability to locations they can reach over land or by air (over friendly or neutral nations). Their military is smaller than it was, mostly conscript based, and is shrinking due to the demographic issues that Russia currently suffers from. In a stand up fight with a numerically equivalent Western force from, say, France, the UK, or the US, I don't see how they could possibly win.

Russia has geopolitical aims which essentially boil down to annexing or dominating the nations of the former Soviet Union. In places like the Baltic and the Ukraine, the tactics have been what ""Yes, Minister"" once called ""salami tactics"" - take a slice of a country here, a slice there, but never formally declare war, and always paint yourself as a victim defending the interests of Russian ethnics in the target nations.

The zombies are banging in the door and it's only a matter of minutes before they get in and eat both of you alive, an excruciating death. So you choose the painless way out: you'll shoot yourself with the shotgun. But do you just leave the kid there to be eaten, or do you put her down first so that she doesn't have to suffer?

106,TrueAskReddit,"Why has culture declared watching TV and using the computer as negative activities, while reading is thought of as positive?","While all of those activities can be mentally engaging, I think the real reason why we think less of TV and internet browsing as opposed to reading is because reading is seen as an *active* form of media whereas TV and web browsing are seen as *inactive*.

What I mean by that is that when you watch TV, you are fed content.  It's presented to you, and there's no mental processing required.  Yes, certain shows make you think and are engaging, but not while you're watching it, only afterwards upon reflection.

Reading, on the other hand, requires focus and a mental discipline not required by TV *while you're doing it*.  Think about it this way: how many times have you read something so meaningful, so striking, that you stopped reading for a second so you could reflect on it?  Now how often have you done that with TV?

Okay, okay, so maybe you've done that with TV too, but I think it's safe to assume that one happens more than the other.  And while I don't think TV is completely mindless, it's just more mindless than reading.  When comparing the two, it's easy for TV to seem more negative.

The internet, on the other hand, is miscategorized.  While there is a mindless entertainment side of the internet (cats videos, memes, etc.), there's also an extremely engaging side of the internet that allows people to actively participate in discussions, like this one.  The internet allows many people to express their ideas and find new ones.  It also allows to be more aware of the world and its events around us.  I believe that the negative perspective cast upon the internet comes from the fact that it's shown on a screen.  I think TVs possibly stigmatized screens.

And since we're talking about mass media here, I think I'll go off on a tangent and mention video games.  Video games also have a rather negative connotation to them, especially when adults mention that they play with them.  The industry is still seen as a toymaking industry, which is quite unfortunate because it's potentially more engaging than any other type of media there is due to its interactivity.  It's a shame that it has the least amount of credibility even though the field contains so many [interesting](http://www.necessarygames.com/my-games/loneliness/flash) and [thought-provoking](http://www.molleindustria.org/everydaythesamedream/everydaythesamedream.html) games.

(Note: I might be a little biased because I secretly really want to be a game developer.)

tl;dr While TV can be engaging, it often only is upon reflection and not while you're watching, whereas reading is often engaging while you read.  The internet shouldn't be lumped with TV, but unfortunately is.  Then an off-topic rant about video games.

Well, what about if the **District Attorney** or **Attorney General** brought suit if they thought an oath had been broken? But then, what if the DA or AG is politically on the side of the alleged oath-breaker? Or what if the DA or AG is politically against the supposed oath-breaker and is bringing a ""breech of oath charge"" just to get at them. And then who would charge the DA/AG with breaching *their* oath? Maybe we should let the president decide?

115,TrueAskReddit,Will the USA rise and fall similarly to how Rome did? What are some of the parralells and differences?,"It’s extreme oversimplification to say the least. As two have already pointed out Rome took centuries to decline, and the similarities are only on the surface. 

For one, Rome’s issue was mainly that their entire northern border was with non state entities. Rome and Persia, while not fully modern states, were centralized political entities with central taxation and administration. Outside of them there wereTribes of varying complexity. Tribes that, when pressured, could simply pick up and move as entire fluid political units. This meant that at any time either power could have independently run polities pushing into their borders. Rome has the misfortune of having hundreds and hundreds of miles to defend against such groups. 

Second, Rome early on enjoyed a massive demographic advantage over Tribal Europe. Demographic expansion in the Med in the  last millennium spread from the Near east west, reaching Italy around the time the Roman Republic was supposedly founded. (All Roman record prior to 380 BCE were lost when Rome was sacked) Spreading north with and slightly ahead of Roman expansion Rome was able to tap into her much higher supply of manpower. This advantage would dry up as Rome entered the 2nd century CE. So when Augustus set the borders Rome was more than able to man her borders. However as time went on, the Tribes beyond grew both in population and political complexity. 

Third, Rome achieved her height of power prior to the appearance of True plague diseases. The Antonine Plague, starting in 165, was the first serious plague and it of course wouldn’t be the last. Mainly devastating settled communities, plagues would do much to offset the advantages between the civilized powers and their Tribal neighbors.  

Despite all this Rome took forever to fall. Rome was absurdly stable considering how large and diverse it was. By the time her issues really began to tear the empire apart Rome had managed to fully incorporate the many peoples of the Mediterranean. Syrians, Egyptians, Greeks, and everyone else all viewed themselves as Romans. Every internal conflict the Romans fought, was considered to be a civil war. Every one was always one commander looking to siege power. Never a local looking to form an independent kingdom. Even the Palmyrene and the Gallic empires, these were efforts by Local Romans to see to defending local Romans from the aggressions Emperors had failed to defend from. 

Because of that, Rome managed to survive in the East despite there being very few Latin speakers. Still slowly declining, but clinging on to and scraping back what they could. Rome represents what is likely the most surprisingly stable and lasting state humans have ever created. 


The US could follow a similar trajectory. If climate change turns out to be truly apocalyptic and massive numbers of people are displaced over the next century or two then an analogue to Romes’s decline is really possible. 

However, for the US to follow Rome in its decline the US will actually have to prove to be a survivor. We will need to survive as a state despite the world collapsing as we know it. Even if we lost territory, even if half the nation fell into permanent chaos. The US would need to not only make it past the end of the world as we know it, America would need to survive into what ever stable geopolitical reality emerges centuries after a climatic collapse. 

Then, centuries from now, after we’ve survived and partially recovered from generations of trauma and turmoil we finally receive a mortal blow that leads to the fall of our country.  "
116,TrueAskReddit,"As a foreigner watching a lot of American TV, I gotta ask: is going to jail in the US that bad?","It varies a lot by what part of government is responsible for your incarceration. A little background: Because we have a federated system, there are state crimes and federal crimes. If you just snap and kill your partner in your home, you've committed good old fashion murder, which isn't a federal offense, but it is a state felony. Your state will prosecute you and put you into a state prison. But if you're a drug dealer and are caught moving cocaine across state lines, you're probably going to be busted for federal felonies. A federal court will convict and sentence you. 

Federal prisons are administered by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and each state has its own corrections department.

In *theory*, all prisons should offer a certain minimal level of care for inmates, because they're all required to meet constitutional requirement for Due Process and are prohibited from having Cruel & Unusual Punishment. However, in practice, prison conditions often don't meet those requirements.

California is a good example. It's very overcrowded, mostly because of the war on drugs and CA's Three Strikes Law, which gives people very long mandatory sentences for committing a third felony, regardless what it is. But in 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that California's overcrowded prisons violate our Eight Amendment, so California's being forced to release a lot of convicts.

It also varies a lot by the degree of your offense. Some prisons are minimum security, reserved for relatively light sentences. At many of them, prisoners are allowed outside with light supervision to do work in the area. Others have higher security, up to the point where some prisoners spend 23 hours a day confined to a cell alone. 

Then there's jail and civil confinement. I assume when you said ""jail"" in your title you actually meant prison. Jail in the USA usually refers to local facilities under the control of police and sheriff departments. These are the places you get sent while you're under arrest and/or awaiting trial, but before you get convicted. So whenever you watch a Western movie and some guy gets into a drunken brawl and thrown behind bars? That's jail, not prison.

Jail conditions can range from ""not that bad at all!"" to horrible. Jails often have much less supervision than prisons because they're viewed as ""temporary."" If a jailed person wanted to sue the state for the conditions of the jail, his claim likely won't be heard, because the courts' view is that he'll eventually get a trial, which means he'll either be released entirely or sent to prison. Unfortunately, because many locations have very back-logged systems, people can spend years in the ""jail system.""

Finally, there's the civil confinement system, which has quietly grown to become a major component of the justice system in the USA. This system come into play when there's a *civil* adjudication that a person needs to be confined for their safety and/or the safety of others - involuntary commitment.

Interestingly, *lots* of sex offenders get into this system *after* they're released from prison! Here's a typical example in my state of Illinois: A man is convicted of a sex offense against a minor and sent to prison. He serves two years. However, at the end of his release, the State files a petition in the court to have him evaluated for civil commitment, under the theory that he has some kind of irresistible compulsion to act again. After some evaluations and reviews of his behavior in prison, the court might decide he needs to be confined for public safety. The man is then ""released"" from prison, only to be put into a different facility for the civilly confined.

*Technically* this isn't prison, since he's not being sent there for a crime by the court. It's more like he's being sent to an asylum for treatment. But obviously in effect, the guy is still locked up. And these facilities often are pretty nasty; part of that comes from the fact that society deems the people in them to be the worst of the worst. And don't get me wrong - a lot of the people who wind up in them are *monsters* - repeat child rapists, for instance, who had previously spent 10 years in prison only to commit another rape the very day after their release. But others are people with much more mild offenses, like Reddit's favorite stereotype of the 19 year old man who gets convicted for sex with a 17 year old girl who had notarized documents that said she was 45.

I think if they articulate themselves like you did - ""the right to not be demonized, persercuted and discriminated for your sexuality"" - then that movement probably won't get off the ground. I think most people are going to scoff at the idea that it's wrong for them to be grossed out at pedophiles. The most morally upstanding pedophiles are people who are fighting to not molest children. I can see how that's pretty laudable in a certain sense, but at the same time, having urges to do horrible things doesn't make you very sympathetic. 

But if the focus is on help and support for what is obviously not a choice and a very desperate situation, then yeah, some people might be able to get behind that. I think it's important for a pragmatic approach to be taken in this case. If that happens,  yeah, I could see some movement towards treatment options instead of blanket hatred and vilification. I don't think it'll ever compare to something like the gay rights movement, but something could happen. "
118,TrueAskReddit,What industry should we just let die?,"The textbook industry really needs change.

That's completely absurd and on top of that you need a unique code that comes with the book in order to submit homework. College is expensive enough without companies like this.

Someone I know had a professor in college once that hated the textbook industry, so he used a textbook he wrote to be the main material of the class and instead of making them buy it, he gave everyone a free digital copy of it."

121,TrueAskReddit,A common argument against the electoral college is that the cities will control everything and the poor rural folk will be left behind and marginalized. Why is this a bad thing?,"The system as it is now gives much more weight to only certain rural states. Many rural states are ignored due to the Electoral College. Candidates don’t campaign in Montana, Kansas, or West Virginia. And they spend time in big cities in Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. So the only states that matter to politicians are the so called swing states.  And while people like to say that rural voices would be ignored if we abolished the EC, the truth is right now if you are a Democrat in a red state, your vote does not count. Same if you are Republican in a blue state. The EC actually disenfranchises people.
Why should the a rural vote count more than urban vote? It shouldn’t but that is what is happening under the EC. Trump won more districts but the majority of those districts had few actual people. When the candidate who loses the popular vote continues to win, it’s a problem. No matter what anybody says the fairest way to elect a president is one person and one vote. So to answer your question, it’s not a bad thing. And it’s not “cities” who are voting,  it’s the people in them."
122,TrueAskReddit,"Can people, one day, from all over the world simultaneously live a 'comfortable' life?","I like to think that it is possible, but I doubt that we will last long enough to make it happen. It would take generations of reprogramming our brains to free us from superstitions and prejudice. We're basically animals who have developed intelligence, and we seem to use that intelligence to find ways to be better animals. 

A lot of people have thought about this: Jesus and Marx being the two most famous. Jesus thought the answer lay in man's relationship to God and Marx thought the answer could be found in economics. Both of these boil down to man's relationship with others, since man invented both God and economics."
123,TrueAskReddit,"In a romantic relationship, where is the line between asking someone to compromise (good) and asking someone to change (bad)?","I don't think anyone can really answer this for you, but I imagine compromising is like asking your partner to reconsider a choice - (ie: would you schedule your soccer games closer to home so you can pick up groceries  after?) 

Change is more like asking someone to alter something fundamental about their personality (I don't like that you play soccer all the time - would you be a less competitive person?) 

In practice, I think these two often run up against each other, even in couples where people have perfect intentions. And a lot of relationship strife comes when one (or both) people have compromised so often on little issues that it's effectively piled up into trying to change. 

While I think the conventional wisdom to not try to change your partner is good, it's also a bit misleading because people do change as they grow older and more committed, and you don't want someone who is completely resistant to that. I think the crux of that wisdom is that the way someone treats you NOW is likely to stay the same, so you should not enter into a relationship with someone with the expectation that they'll suddenly become more romantic, or more committed, or more sexual, etc.


Hope this helps!

124,TrueAskReddit,Why is the right to die such a controversial issue?,"Here's a basic answer for you (for lack of seeing a more complete one). I'm not quite sure what you were referring to, medically assisted suicide or regular suicide, so I'll address both. Part of the answer tends to lie with the pressures associated with it. In the United States, although not untrue in certain other parts of the world, medical care can be associated with extremely high health insurance costs. For an elderly person who may or may not have much longer to live, avoiding passing along mountains of debt to their significant other or children who may not be able to afford it could be the driving incentive behind medically assisted suicide. The other side of the coin is that relatives may pressure these people into death, be it to avoid debt or (a more powerful incentive) early access to their will, money, property, etc.
For suicide, the reason why I've heard it's illegal (within the US, not sure about elsewhere) is because making it illegal allows police to intervene and potentially stop someone who is suicidal. While I cannot vouch for the truth of that statement, it seems to hold water and makes sense."
125,TrueAskReddit,How do I interview job candidates in a way that avoids unconscious racial bias?,"In the pre screening process (resume only, no physical presence or visual), try to find a way to hide the name of the applicant. This will slightly lower the risk of racial or gender bias.

126,TrueAskReddit,To what extent should we sacrifice our lives for our disabled siblings?,"I think it depends on how you view the concept of family. One view is that the parents chose to have children, and like anyone knows or should know, something could go wrong. It’s their responsibility to provide for the child and the siblings can contribute if they wish, or live separate lives.

Other people might feel like the genetic bond is important enough to honor that, even in the case where reciprocity is impossible, it is still right and, in an abstract sense, beneficial to meet any obligations and duties that arise from the misfortunes of an immediate family member, especially when that family member cannot fend for him or herself.

Ultimately, I think the fairest perspective is to leave it the decision up to the sibling. However, a rational and fair person would at least honestly share with their decision as early and as completely with their parents as possible. E.g. Bob doesn’t want to take care of his autistic brother. It’s better the parents to know this concretely when Bob is 20 and his brother is 18 than to skirt the issue until the parents die and Bob just walks away, leaving his brother to whims of the state."
127,TrueAskReddit,"If Lee Kuan Yew transformed Singapore from a 3rd world country into a country that has a higher GDP than the US (1 in 6 households have over 1 million dollars in disposable income), and has the least amount of corruption in the world, why don't more countries adopt the same type of gov't?","Singaporean here. There are some things unique to Singapore that other countries will find hard to replicate. For example, the government provided public housing throughout the entire country, which is currently at about 80%. Other third world countries will find it difficult, because of their large size. Singapore managed to continually construct housing throughout the past 5 decades in tandem with population growth. In larger countries, there will always be a district or town that will be neglected due to many reasons, political corruption, construction resources etc. 

Another emphasis for Singapore's government was the importance of education. Education is compulsory up to the age of 16, and guarantees basic math, science and reading skills. It is also very heavily subsidised, where primary school costs like $15 a month, and everything else is footed by the government. This is money being invested that doesn't see a return until 20-40 years later, and if current politicians don't see the immediate return on their investment, its hard to pass reform in the first place. 

Singapore is also a one party democracy, where PAP controls 90% of constitutencies in Singapore, and a unified government won't have 2 political parties bickering and arguing at each other and not getting anything done. Good luck for a political party in a third world country anywhere to sweep 90%, given a fair election in the first place.

There are a lot of state owned agencies as well, e.g. state-owned television and print media. Singapore ranks really low in International Press Freedom rankings as well, and we have pretty tough censorship laws. It's a price to pay in return for this though. At least we won't get FOX-News type of news, but our information is censored here and there. 

We also have tough laws like the death penalty that are enforced pretty harshly that help to keep the streets safe at night. You won't be able to bribe any law-enforcer or state agency in Singapore.  "

130,TrueAskReddit,If social skills are actually skill then why are they so hard for some people to learn?,"Social skills are skills and I believe there is research behind it, but it is a combination of psychology and anthropology. This is because social traits that are valued in different ways in different cultures. 

While you can define social traits (eg humor, gregariousness, patience, etc) in an effort to quantify skills, social traits are inherently subjective. Part of their impact lies within context and the eyes of the beholder. A joke might be hilarious with your  family, but fall flat with someone you barely know. Same is true with a joke at a bar vs a joke at a funeral. 

Although trying to quantify an inherently subjective skill is difficult, and I would argue it doesn’t get to the real issue. Mastering any skill set, from maths to working a room, will be a different experience for each person. This is due to their unique talents, their prior experience, and how they approach the task. This is why chess masters have different styles and no two comedians are alike. *It’s also why people who are talented or experienced in social skills are also often working to improve those skills.*

Look at how many books exist about improving small talk, persuasive presentations,  networking, leadership, etc. (Check your library for a large and free selection) Social people are always honing those skills. And while they might have talents in that direction, they may be particularly weak in other skills. Perhaps they struggle to grasp music, chemistry, or basic organization skills. I personally struggled with math from arithmetic right on through, but I still passed pre-calc. 

My point is that even if social skills are not where your talents lean, you can still learn and improve. You will notice progress overtime, even if you can’t easily measure it. The human mind is a fantastically powerful and adaptive thing. You may not be able to reach a level of mastery with some others, but you certainly can learn how to make a girl laugh. 

Apologies that I’m not well versed on the particular challenges of the autism spectra. Hopefully someone else can get more detailed and give advice on that topic."
131,TrueAskReddit,Is everything just... escapism?,"I think maybe the best way to answer this is by evaluating the difference between running *from* something and running *to* something. Let’s say for the sake of the discussion we can define what a particular reality is. Let’s say this reality has a negative impact on a particular individual, they find it unpleasant, restrictive, boring, painful, scary, etc. If they seek out and spend most of their time engaging in activities that distract or numb them, making existing in that reality less negative but perpetuating those conditions, that’s escapism. They focus of moving away from what’s negative but are not moving towards something more positive (in the long run at least). The escape is a temporary reprieve but does not truly free them from anything. With escapism there’s a sort of presupposition that you are not in control of reality and therefore can not make changes which a lot of times is true but a lot of times is not.

Whereas if you know what you don’t like about reality and take steps to improve it, whether internal or external, those activities aren’t a brief escape they are a path to more freedom, more control over your own reality.

One is a method for not dealing with reality the other is for actively engaging with reality, whatever nature of reality that may be.

 But it is nebulous. If you describe an innocent man in prison turning inward and meditating deeply, is that escapism or is that enlightenment? If that same man instead does anything, ethical or not, to get out, is that escapism or just seeking freedom?

Some of the very same activities can be powerful tools for both escapism and deep engagement with reality depending on the mindset of the user.

At the end of this ramble I guess I’d have to say that any time reality, whether mundane or existential, confronts you with something you don’t want to accept turning down any path that only takes you back to a place of non acceptance is escapism. There are other choices: making changes in the external or internal conditions of that reality, learning how to accept the things that can’t be changed.

Great question!"
132,TrueAskReddit,Why is it alright to devote more time and energy to an SO at the expense of long-time friends?,"It’s about exclusivity. As you rightly point out OP, you can very much do many of the same things with your best friend that you would do with your SO (split bills, live together, etc.) Are you and your best friend on the same page of being each other’s best friends? In that case, you’d be willing to drive 2 hours to see them, rearrange your office commitments to make their birthday party, etc. But what if you have multiple best friends?

133,TrueAskReddit,Why is ethnic diversity seen as a goal in and of itself? Is this healthy?,"I think the idea is that ethnically diverse groups tend to be culturally and socioeconomically diverse.  I have studied with international students from nearly every country of the world.  This has allowed me to develop a broader worldview.  Not only do I have friends with different skin colors, I have friends of different religions, who celebrate different holidays, and who have grown up in very poor countries.  Even among my American friends, I know people who are Native American, Jewish, etc., and I have learned more about their heritage than I could from a textbook.

I do agree somewhat that if a group of white, Latino, black, and Asian students, who grew up in the same city and had and the same socioeconomic upbringing, go to the same university, that the diversity based on ethnic background makes little difference."

135,TrueAskReddit,What are some actual solutions to the issues incels say that they face?,"Comprehensive sex education isn’t a solution, per se, but it sure as hell wouldn’t hurt. How to discuss sex, consent and enthusiastic consent, communicating about and during sex, how flirting works, recognizing wanted/unwanted sexual attention... Sexuality is a skill and, moreover, it’s a communication skill, so you have to learn it in group environments. If someone is socially isolated, it’s going to take longer to learn or they risk learning maladaptive ideas from bad sources. Bonus points because this approach has good effects on “me too” behavior and could reduce the types of ideas that make up rape culture.

The downside is that puritanical helicopter parents, evangelicals and other abstinence-only zealots would lose their shit over teaching high schoolers these essential life skills."
136,TrueAskReddit,"How does society find the balance between believing the victim and maintaining the belief of ""innocent until proven guilty""?","To start with, innocent until proven guilty belongs solely within the realm of criminal law. It states a presumption that exists until a jury in a criminal case renders a verdict of guilty, thereby exposing the accused to loss of liberty for their crime. If that burden is not met, the presumption applies and you are treated as innocent even if that is not the case. 

People tend to forget that and apply it in all manner of situations that are not criminal trials. So the real question is what presumption, if any, do we apply in any given situation. The answer should be that it depends. 

Think about it this way. Would you require proof beyond a reasonable doubt (which is our actual criminal burden, not proof beyond a shadow of a doubt as you suggested) that a credibly accused child molester was guilty before saying “no, you can’t watch my child”? Of course not. The safety of your child is much more important than respecting the rights of the accused in that situation. You are not exposing the accused to a loss of liberty by denying him the opportunity to babysit your kid. If he is innocent, then it is true that the false allegation will impact his life in other ways, but it’s not necessarily unfair to presume the truth of the accusation in that situation before additional evidence is brought forward. 

This dovetails with the question of respecting the victim. Going back to the criminal arena, respecting the victim could mean listening to that person, taking a police report, and perhaps making an arrest. But if the evidence is simply not enough to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, the victim deserves to sit down with the person making that decision and hear why. 

“Victim” in the sense you use it is a label attached to a person who accuses another of a crime. That person may or may not be a true victim depending upon whether the accusation is in fact true. Likewise, many true victims never come forward and therefore never are publicly recognized as victims. 

The bottom line is this: All persons deserve our respect as humans. Guilty, innocent, victims, liars, mentally impaired, etc. Whether we pursue a certain course of action following an accusation is beside the point. The circumstances surrounding that accusation should dictate how it will be treated. There is no magical formula other than good judgment.

The truth seems to be that the more urban an area is, the more liberal it tends to be.

That's not just the south either. It may surprise you to look at a map of voting districts and see that states you may have thought were extremely liberal will have red voting districts the further you travel from a major city center.

138,TrueAskReddit,Any redditors ever want to be part of a completely different social group?,"So, to preface this somewhat, I'm a third-culture kid who came back to my ""home base"" on several occasions. The first time I lived in home base, I was in seventh grade and made some great friends, and I think that my anger at leaving caused me to remember them slightly more fondly than they actually were, either that or people change. Both are possible. 

So anyway, I have this group of friends right after college, who are all in their mid-twenties and working. Most are pretty smart to very smart, and they're all dudes with the rotating retinue of whatever girls had decided to hang out with them that month. They all have money, either self-made or family money or both. I hang out with these guys because of the since-7th-grade-ness of the relationship with one member of the group. I'm the only girl who hangs out in the group who is not dating one of them. 

They're pretty much my only friends at this point, because I don't like people in general and find it difficult to make friends that I feel like are worth having, so I'm hanging out with them a lot. 

I know that they're superficial and a bit shallow, but I overlook it as they're young and monied and generally have women falling over them, so their being picky as to appearance is one way of weeding women out. 

So, we're heading into DC this one time to go to some douchebag bar because someone in our group won a happy hour tab (someone in our group won a happy hour tab there every time we went, and we only went if someone had won a happy hour tab). Anyway, we're sitting on the metro, and we're talking about whatever, and we hit a stop. The doors open and a trio of ladies walks into our car. 

They are larger ladies. They are very obviously celebrating a bachelorette party. The bride is with them.

My group EXPLODES in laughter. To the point that two of the guys have to *literally walk to the other end of the car to get themselves under control*. It's loud, and the ladies hear it, and they know my friends are laughing at them. I could see their faces; a night of celebration has now been turned into one of self-doubt and shame. I feel like an asshole for even being located *near* these guys on the train, much less *with* these guys on the train. It's the last straw for me (I'm no tiny chick).

I whipped around, looked at all of them one by one with the iciest glare I could muster, and said calmly, ""each of you is single. Someone *loves* her."" 

I moved to the other end of the train, shooting an apologetic glance at the ladies as I moved past, and got off at the next stop.

142,TrueAskReddit,"Why do only a few individuals get caught for illegal file sharing, and what caused these people get caught over the multitude of peer-to-peer users?","It's essentially like playing a lottery.  The RIAA had to:

1. Get a list of IP addresses connected to a particular file being shared, usually by also connecting into the same P2P network.  And to get a bigger damage charge of redistributing, they look for proof the IP has uploaded, not just downloaded.
2. Look up the owners of the IP, in most cases this is an ISP or university.
3. Coordinate with the abuse departments of the owners of the IP to try and obtain the actual account (with a responsible persons name attached) behind the IP.  If enough time has elapsed, it's possible the ISP no longer has the logs that could identify this.
4. Coordinate with law enforcement to get more details to proceed with a lawsuit.
5. Be successful in court convincing the judge that it was the person they accused who actually did the download, and not someone else on the shared network.  Open WiFi networks sometimes got a few people out of these charges, other times the judge still said the account holder was responsible for any activity on the network.

Many ISPs and courts got tired of the RIAA trying to do mass sweeps.  It costs time, and thus salary of someone to look up what account had what IP at what time.  The RIAA initially tried going right to the courts with just IPs, and wanting the courts to do steps 2-4 for them, but most rejected this.

With all the effort, and places where someone may say no, they tend to get just a few names.  The court cases are then more about the RIAA trying to send a warning to other users.  ""Look at this person being fined 6-7 figures, do you want that?  No?  Go buy music instead.""

143,TrueAskReddit,Who is at fault when sarcasm is lost?,"I think it's a crucial part of sarcasm that not everyone *should* get it, and in that sense, using it very much depends on your audience.

For example, [this clip from a kids' show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWdD206eSv0) was not intended to be sarcastic, but on reddit, the quote has an unambiguous sarcastic reading, because redditors are experienced (not to mention jaded) internet users.

So when you ask whose fault it is if sarcasm is lost, my answer would be the author, for misjudging the audience.

That said, some readers enjoy nothing more than getting the joke that nobody else does, and hate having sarcasm spelled out for them. The ability to ""get"" internet jokes/references/sarcasm has become a measure of social standing.

If you want to improve the chances of your sarcasm being understood as such, there are some small verbal clues you can include in your writing, such as the adverb ""surely"" or the sentence ""Yeah, right.""

Sarcasm being misunderstood goes back centuries. A good example is Jonathan Swift's essay ""A Modest Proposal"" (1729) in which the author proposes with a perfect poker face that encouraging the Irish poor to cook their own children as food and offer them to the rich to eat is a perfect way to stop starvation and control the population at the same time. Not everyone got the joke at the time. Maybe this is the reason for Swift's quote, ""The hate of fools and fools to hate / be that my motto and my fate."""
144,TrueAskReddit,Why do most global conspiracies always circle back around to anti science or antisemitism?,"Because it's the sort of explanation that makes intuitive sense, if you don't know much about science. If you're the sort of person who believes that there is a class of people who are putting one over on the public (and by ""the public"", you think ""people like me""), then scientists are a strong candidate for people doing confusing things that you don't understand, people who seem like they know something you don't and might be taking advantage of you with that.

Some people are so ill-served by the educational system that we almost ask them to take the operation of scientific progress on faith, because science just seems like this alien set of traditions and principles that are practiced by weird priests in white coats. From that perspective, it makes some sense that a person would feel suspicious of that (it's also more appealing to think that you're wise to a grand conspiracy than to confront the idea that you yourself are not that well-informed).

Anti-semitism is trickier and has a more complicated history that I'm not really qualified to opine on. But spending millennia ostracizing people is sure to make them seem like ""the other"".

What can they offer to China other than cheap manufacturing, which China has in abundance. Modernizing NK will take huge amounts of investment and cooperation from the NK leadership.

So that leaves China in its current situation. Their only real concern would be the influx of refugees if NK collapses. A smaller side benefit to China being an ""ally"" with NK would be since NK is somewhat abrasive in the international stage when they sabre rattle, China becomes entity that is called upon to talk some sense into NK.

149,TrueAskReddit,Should it be considered anti-competitive for Apple to prioritize Apple Music over Spotify within their own product (App Store)?,"Honestly, both of your premises are correct.

It is anti-competitive, but it's also within their rights to do so. 

That's why Spotify made a video instead of sending a lawyer. The only thing that can make Apple change their ways is public outcry, and Spotify knows this. It's also good marketing on their behalf, painting themselves as the 'good guy' VS Apple 'bad guy'.

151,TrueAskReddit,How differently would we design cities from scratch given modern ideas and technology?,"I think one crucial thing is it would be built around mobility and convenience. I see blended districts, with offices, housing, and shops all intermixed, green spaces mixed with transit. I don't really see much infrastructure for cars except to get to mass transit from outside the city, or to leave the city.

Urban geography is really big right now and there are a lot of ideas about reducing energy consumption and waste while instilling a sense of community into neighborhoods. Increased walkability improves security of an area, and community gardens are getting attention and becoming popular again. Cities built from the ground up today would be far less scary, integration of all people and needs could nearly eliminate bad areas.

154,TrueAskReddit,Why has “optimism” become a synonym for “naivety”?,"I can't speak for the decades that I wasn't alive to experience, but I know in my lifetime the average person seems to feel that their security (mostly financial) is very tenuous...or non-existent. The power imbalance is enormous. The minority of obscenely rich and powerful can do more, influence more, than a collective of middle class people can hope to achieve. 

So, how do we respond? I believe it's with cynicism. Cynicism protects from actions or feelings that can cause tangible and intangible repercussions. A tangible example is being unemployed after getting an English degree, where intangible might be something like our feelings over failing, or over security. If we approach everything with caution then there is lower risk. 

Personally, I find the 'survivorship bias' of the rich, powerful and famous - or those that believe what they say - to be extremely naive. They have clearly little to no appreciation for what it's like to not make it. They're are ignorant of their own luck. Trying or 'not giving up on your dreams' will not be the determining factor in whether or not you succeed in getting into the 1%. They forget this. So, honestly, in this case I believe a healthy dose of cynicism can only help most people. To believe that you're going to make it is much more likely to mean that you're going to be a waitress in LA while you tell all your customers that you're really an actress and this is just your side gig.

155,TrueAskReddit,How much faster would advancements in technology and medicine be made if every single industrialized country suddenly decided to devote 20% of their GDPs to research?,"It depends. In my industry (electric vehicles) the $ per vehicle decline due to increased *production*, not the invention of a better widget. Ultracapitors can store megawatts of energy in a small space, but they’re too expensive. Expensive widgets = risk in the eyes of the customer, so they’re unlikely to sign up for such a device. Thus the groundbreaking widget rots in a R&D lab somewhere. 

(Universities also suck at anything to do with commercializing their own products. The professors are too concerned with teaching and managing grad students, who are the real workhorse anyway. But the grad students don’t have the project management experience of delivering “good enough” research and they get lost in the weeds.)

I think most of the presidents that are considered good had to do something big that helped people across the whole spectrum, while at the same time not doing something that pissed off their enemies.

158,TrueAskReddit,Are job interviews BS?,"Being able to communicate with your team members and contribute to the collective work of your organization *is* a qualification. 

If you do great work, individually, but cannot function in a team environment, another worker who does marginally worse individual work - but is a positive contribution to the team - is more total productivity added to the total system. 

And very often, it’s much easier to teach job-specific skills than social skills, so selecting for someone who will be positive to the whole organization is prioritized over someone who might be very good at just their specific role.

So if you’re seeing social screening of interviews as “worthless” and feeling like you’re super qualified but awkward - that *perspective* is probably much more the cause of your difficulties than your awkwardness is specific.  It’s important to recognize we’re a society of specialists and individuals’ solitary merits are very very secondary to their capacity for supporting and contributing to the team and organization collectively. In not seeing social skills as *part* of the qualifications for the job, you’re indicating it’s not something you’re open to developing within in order to be a better fit for the job."

- We may be past the point of no return for hitting the target limit of 1.5C or 2C rise.

163,TrueAskReddit,Has anyone ever actually learned a second language solely through public school?,"I spent years learning French in school.  I got great grades.  But I couldn't communicate properly in French when, years later, I met a French girlfriend (later wife).

What I realised through re-learning French, and through having bilingual children, is that language teaching in school (as I was taught it) is pedagogically unsound.

When in school, we were focussed on reading and writing French.  You'd create lists of nouns and verbs to learn.  Listening and speaking were very, very secondary.

When kids learn a language from very young, they do so by listening, listening, listening, and finally making sense of the words, they start to speak, and we correct them, and gradually they build up a vocabulary that is ""direct"", not translated - i.e. they look at a tree and learn the word tree.

Much later, we teach them the written version of the language.

This is important, because languages like French are actually simpler to speak.  The I, you (s) and he/she/it endings often sound almost the same, where as they look very different.  If you're focussed on learning the different last letter between the I and you version of a word like cuisiner (je cuisine, tu cuisines) then you're missing the vibe of the language.

After reading a great book called [The Third Ear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Ear_\(book\)) and actually spending time in France with my wife, I learned heaps more than in school.

How accurate and practical are his claims?","You've asked a complex series of questions that are impossible to answer in this limited time but I'll do my best to answer your questions. Also I'm on mobile so I apologize for the big links. 

Yes drug companies have purchased underpriced drugs and raised prices before, see this article for just one example (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/a-huge-overnight-increase-in-a-drugs-price-raises-protests.html?_r=0), but the reasons behind this are relatively modern. In the past, and continuing today, drug companies aimed to consolidate the industry. Pharma companies generally avoid early stage research and instead focus on marketing, sales, late stage research, and navigating the drug approval process as their strengths. Because of,this there is a long history of smaller companies being acquired. 

What's changing today is just what he named in the Bloomberg clip, this drug is underpriced relative to its peer group and they want it priced efficiently relative to their peers. He's also correct that people need this drug so while the Mt Sinai doctor says they'll look around if there isn't am alternative treatment approved already then they have to use it. 

These pricing strategies are one of the core reasons behind why healthcare is so expensive. 

It's difficult to judge changes to patient access but it's almost guaranteed that raising the price won't increase access. It won't necessarily decrease access in a significant way though. Most likely what they've judged is that if they raise the price the way they did then most people can still get it at a low cost but wealthy patients and insurance companies will pay so Much more that revenue will jump.

170,TrueAskReddit,"Is the meaning of a word determined by the intention of the speaker, or the impression of the listener?","This is quite an interesting question and lots of research have been done over the years. I'll try to quickly summarise some key perspectives that I have learned and read a little about.

\-------

**(1) Encoder-decoder model:**

The encoder-decoder model is the simplest model but also an oversimplification and ignores contexts, which can greatly affect the meaning of a given message. In this model, meaning of a word is a property of the message. That is, communication would be about the autonomous processes of encoding (speaker) and decoding (listener) of signals, with no room for ambiguity. There would be a single meaning for each signal (e.g., Morse code), and it would be the listener's responsibility to comprehend the message and determine the meaning.

**(2) Intentionalist model:**

This is similar to the encoder-decoder model in that meaning is a property of the message. However, contexts are taken into account and as such words and meaning do not have a fixed relationship. Communication is thus the exchange of communicative intentions in which listeners must infer the speakers' intended meaning using a 3-stage model:

Stage 1: Listener decode the literal meaning of the utterance (word/ sentence meaning like in the encoder-decoder model)

Stage 2: Listener determine appropriateness of the literal meaning (taking into account contexts)

Stage 3: Listener inferring the speaker’s intended meaning

Listeners accomplish stage 2 through conversational rules (‘maxims’). Violations of the rules would be informative, and would indicate that the listener should look past the literal meaning of words, reinterpret the utterance in light of contexts to arrive at the intended meaning. For example, Person A wasn't invited to a party, yet says “thanks for the invite”. This would violate the maxim of quality and the listener would have to infer and determine the intended meaning of Person A.

**(3) Perspective-taking model:**

One limitation of the intentionalist model is that it does not take into account audience design even though research have shown that speakers tend to design utterances with the destination in mind. In this case, meaning would be message + model of the addressee (e.g., how well you understand/model the mind of your addressee).

**(4) Collaborative model:**

All the aforementioned models assume that speaker and listener are autonomous (distinct roles, speaker produces and listener processes). However, research have also shown that transfer of meaning can actually be a product of interaction between speaker and addressee where meaning is ‘mutually agreed’. That is, in practical communication situations, the respective roles of speakers and listeners are often ambiguous and the determination of meaning would rely upon creating and updating a situational model for each partner. However, this can be cognitively demanding and effortful so the extent to which we actually do this is actually contentious.

**(5) Interactive-alignment model:**

This model represents an alternative inter-personal account of communication that helps explain why giving (and listening to) a speech is difficult; yet holding a conversation is easy. In this model, transfer of meaning is via an alignment process across different linguistic levels such that two communicators converge in their usage of sounds, language structures, semantics, and pragmatics through implicit priming. This process is effortless and it is likely that we use a combination of effortful negotiations and implicit alignments to determine meaning.

\------

I became a little lazy towards the end of my post (Google the models if you want to read more) but basically, in the first three models, meaning is a function of the *message, contexts, etc.*, whereas it is a function of the *interaction* (both explicit and implicit) in the final two models.

I don't think it's possible to know, really. Intelligence agencies can't do public post-mortems on their investigations, and compartmentalized classifications mean that even a high ranking intelligence officer only knows the details of their own programs. 

The only people who can truly evaluate the effectiveness of large intelligence operations are the same brass-ranked officers who have political pressures tainting their public statements.

173,TrueAskReddit,Should an artist’s actions be separate from his work or should they be considered one?,"When we look at the revelations from #metoo and the entertainment industry, it’s easy to see how having such awful people influencing our culture may normalize bad behavior. Woody Allen’s works delve into his fucked up relationships with young women and ephebophilia and Allen’s influence on movies and pop culture has been huge. 

Louis CK’s schtick involved him working out his issues with consent, such as the sexual assault scene in “Pamela, Part 1” of Louie that’s played off as a ho-hum sad Charlie Brown moment.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how many reoccurring romance tropes from popular culture may be being propagated by abusers who are working their shit out in their art.

174,TrueAskReddit,"What would it take to have a revival of strong, uncorrupted workers unions in the US?","Since I don't really know much about union laws, all I can offer is my perspective as a blue collar worker. I'm sorry if it doesn't answer your question.

Having recently worked for Amazon, they really pound it in that ""unions are bad for all of us"" without many more facts as to why, just ""it doesn't fit with our business model"". Companies like Amazon know there is a chance unions and worker revolutions are an increasing possibility but my state is a right to work state and they can fire us for almost any reason and Amazon specifically can find new labor as fast as possible. 

Before Hurricane Irma, worker dissatisfaction at my facility was almost at a boiling point, But then they gave us a week's pay and closed our facility. PR wise, a good move, and it cooled some heads over trying to unionize. Workers need to stick to their guns. I admit I wanted to try to do something and spoke to my friends I trusted would not rat me out, but no one wanted to take the risk to help me, so I gave up. Employees who spoke up at company meetings were vilified and shunned and called whiney. Told to ""quit* if you don't like it."" Others at different facilities who make flyers about meeting to unionize are made fun of on unoffical employee social media pages and talking about unions will get you removed from official closed employee facebook groups. 

Amazon tries their best to keep employees on a fine line of happy and unhappy. Happy enough to stay and work but only that much. With all their strictness, they ""make up for it"" with decent insurance, paying a *little* more than flipping burgers, an employee discount for the site, and free snacks on the crazy short 10-15 minute break times but only on overtime days. Basically, they don't treat you well, but its not a sweatshop in China right? 

People who want to unionize are seen as the people who couldn't ""handle it"". The narrative has changed from unions are the ones who got us medical leave, breaks, and employer paid insurance to the people trying to steal your money by charging dues when they don't ""do anything"" because the work and change was already done, except the clock has rolled back and we lose more and more of what unions worked for all that time ago and we are going to have to fight for it again. 

So individuals have to understand that unions are needed again. My father in law broke his shoulder and his company paid for 6 month medical leave, then the next year they were bought out by another company and he was let go and they paid him $20,000 as severance. Yet he genuinely believes unions are worthless, as if they gave him that out of the kindness of their hearts. "
175,TrueAskReddit,What differentiates friendship+attraction from true love?,"While many people might not put much stock in a Christian philosophy on love (given a lot of our obsession on sex and not actually on, you know, what makes a good relationship), I think Rob Bell's *Flame* has a good perspective -- according to him, there are 3 types of love necessary to have a lasting relationship, that he takes from the Bible book of Song of Solomon. (As such, he uses Hebrew words to refer to them, so bear with me.)

The first is ""raya"" -- which you have mentioned already, and describes friendship and companionship. Ideally, this includes wanting the best for each other, and even having affection towards each other. 

There is also ""dod"" -- carouse, fondle, the sexual element that you have also mentioned. 

Lastly, and this is the one I think you've missed mentioning, is what Bell (and the Hebrew language) calls ""ahava"" -- the love of the will. Most people call it commitment. He describes it as such: ""more profound than fleeting romantic feelings. ... much more than temporary urges. It's making the decision to join your life to another."" Friendship and attraction mean nothing without a commitment to a relationship. In this sense, love is not just an emotion, it's an action and a choice. You can't have a successful relationship unless you're occasionally willing to make sacrifices, recognize differences, hash out disagreements, and grow with each other. Because in a sense, no two people are ABSOLUTELY perfect for each other. There is a certain level of compatibility that a relationship starts with, and then any more compatibility a couple has is a result of their working together to grow together. And that willingness to work, that commitment, and that desire to continue to work together, is what keeps a relationship going even when it hits rocky spots. So if one or the other person isn't willing to put in the work and commitment, then a relationship simply won't happen. "
176,TrueAskReddit,"If Kim Jong-un woke up one morning and genuinely decided to turn over a new leaf and become good, Would the world let him? or would they kill him and start with a new leader?","This is a cool question. I'm answering it as someone with a degree in political philosophy.

You don't have to be more than reasonably familiar with North Korea in order to understand the game theory at play over there. Kim Jong-un's regime is critically dependent on a two-pronged power source that has to be constantly **renewable**. Without the constant renewal of these two power elements, he would absolutely be disposed of in what would amount as a military coup, with a side-dish of civil war that would be neutered and irrelevant due to a completely powerless general population:

* *Fear-based hierarchy*: Kim is one man surrounded by hundreds of subordinates operating a political machinery that predates him by two generations. His only legitimacy is generational and this isn't enough to convince the more technocratic-minded of his subordinates to follow him if they're not convinced of his strategic/leadership/military/nation-building ability. As a result, Kim must constantly *renew* a fear-based motive to keep the hierarchy in check with him as the top. He simply cannot afford to go for a prolonged period without, for example, carrying out ""purges"", the random public execution of high-ranking party elders that are perceived as some remote threat. The fact that these purges target elders reinforces that nobody in the hierarchy is safe from Kim's wrath (including [his own uncle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jang_Sung-taek)), and their graphical nature (including [execution via mortar round](http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/03/22/2012032200933.html)) helps crystallize a sensual human fear in people who hear the story and participate in the act. **Kim does not perform these purges because he's evil and angry: he does them strictly out of utility.** Doing these purges is equivalent to mowing a lawn or brushing his teeth: necessary maintenance to prevent the fermentation of a complicated problem. Make no mistake: if Kim goes for a couple of years without reinforcing this rule by fear, he will allow for an organized opposition to ferment on an intellectual level. This strategy also reinforces that the *only* path to personal comfort is complete loyalty to Kim, which is always rewarded and the opposite of which is always terribly punished.

* *Otherization*: The establishment and constant rejuvenation of a fear-based hierarchy keeps the party in check but doesn't do much to affect the loyalty of the general population. This is why Kim has to *constantly keep upping the ante* of his aggression against an ""otherized"" entity, in this case the United States and its ""pet poodle"" South Korea. The ""other"" is an entity that can never be reasoned with because it does not accept reason and that seeks your destruction because of its limitless depravity and ill faith. The threat of apocalyptic war against an infinitely malicious devil keeps the population in check and is exactly why Kim keeps making announcements, each very slightly bolder than the last, about the readiness and capability of his nuclear arsenal, about his very high willingness to invade South Korea at any moment, and so on. Kim has absolutely no interest in ever bombing the United States or even South Korea. This is all simply a survival mechanism that points to a created enemy, directs all negative attention towards it, freeing him to portray himself as the strong leader/hero/savior in whom complete trust is necessary for the people's survival.

Incidentally, otherization is something you'll find everywhere. It dates back hundreds of thousands of years in terms of human evolution and is a fundamental psychology in the survival of tribes. Sadly, it's deeply embedded in the recesses of our brain's architecture. It is exactly the psychology employed by ISIS to motivate attacks against the United States, but can also be seen manifesting itself in situations far less serious, for example Bernie Sanders voters vs. Trump voters, Snowden vs. NSA, Apple fans versus Android diehards... The goal is always to completely strangle and kill the intellectual capacity for nuance. Watch out for [thought-terminating clichés](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clich%C3%A9#Thought-terminating_clich.C3.A9) in your own daily life -- one of the surest indicators of otherization taking place."
177,TrueAskReddit,"If the current “trade war” persisted, how likely would it lead the US to another Great Depression? If so, what can we do to be prepared for it?","As unsatisfying as it is to say, the real answer is probably “it’s tough to say.”  Even making the assumption that the current trade war persisted is not enough make predictions about what will happen- if the tariffs as currently proposed were to remain as is then realistically we probably aren’t looking at another recessionary trigger. The scary thing about trade wars though is that by their very nature they tend to escalate - tit for tat responses can very quickly lead to more and more tariffs and the erection of large barriers to international trade will have an adverse effect on the US economy. Part of the scary thing about wars of all types is that it’s tough to predict how they end.

The other tough thing about free trade and it’s intersection with politics is that while free trade is clearly good for the country as a whole and the majority of the population it is bad for some individuals. We’re in an unprecedented period of economic growth, but your brothers cousins aunt may have lost their job as a result and that is undeniably tough on that family. Politics and coverage in America today though thrives on anecdotes because they play well. It’s easier to rally voters with the story of your brothers cousins aunt than a several basis point move in GDP. Politics today also tends to be reactionary talking about things that have happened to rally support for things that could happen. By the numbers the most common job in America today is truck driver and the average long haul truck driver salary is 71k. These are the new skill based jobs that can support a middle class lifestyle.  In large part these job le are the result of NAFTA. Killing these jobs in the hopes of trying to bring back steel production jobs (which aren’t coming back except in a highly automated way) could have disasterous consequences for the economy. This is just one example of how many factors are in play."

These attributes combined make him likeable, non-threatening, and makes him spiritually appealing, without threatening a persons established beliefs. The religious can like him because they won't be directly persuaded to convert to buddhism. Secularists and atheists like him because he marginally changes his beliefs based on science. Politicians like him because it serves as a political punch to China, and a political boon at home amongst his admirers."
179,TrueAskReddit,Which jobs deserve to be paid minimum wage?,"Servers, cashier, and janitors are in that category, however the issue is the living wage amount.

180,TrueAskReddit,Is it morally wrong to look at a naked neighbour?,"Why did you glance away if he turned his face toward the window?

It seems there is more than one dimension to this example: one, the act of being an unseen watcher; and two, seeing someone naked. The first can be experienced as power. You see them but they don’t see you. The nakedness ups the ante — it’s something most people regard as private. So you are watching someone doing something private, apparently without their awareness. When they turn their face toward you, you look away.

Moral codes define boundaries that regulate our interactions to promote harmony and the greater good. When our natural individual impulses incline us to do one thing, an inner sense of propriety may prompt us to refrain. 

Control over the means of looking is an issue. Many have commented that your neighbour has the power to close his curtains and yet chooses not to. Or does he? It is easy not to be aware. He may have chosen to open his curtains at one time but forgotten to close them later on. 

What do we know? Your respective genders (he’s male, you’re female), your relationship (neighbours), the act (you looking), his state (naked). 

What don’t we know? We don’t know if he is conscious of his visibility in the moment. We don’t know if he is comfortable with being seen naked by you.  

Given that uncertainty, your inner prompting to look away when he might see you looking, and your boyfriend’s concerns, seem valid.

So I’d say, it’s not wrong to notice, but it is wrong to watch."

183,TrueAskReddit,Why Don't We Indent Paragraphs Online?,"I'm a very old person who was involved with the Web back when the first standards document came out.  I will give you the technical history of it.  HTML 1, back when the Web was initiated, didn't really have a ""standards document.""  People at CERN and other huge organizations just called Tim Berners-Lee and asked what formatting commands they could use, and then did it.  He once said in an interview that he had a floppy disk with a list of formatting commands on it, and he just used sneaker-net to distribute it.  However, HTML 2 quickly followed, and *was* a standard.  So, we can look at it:

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt

That super old document is from back in 1994 & 1995, as the Web was creeping into popular awareness.  You can see a few important quotes from it.  For example:

> Typically, paragraphs are surrounded by a vertical space of one line or half a line. The first line in a paragraph is indented in some cases.

So the people making the Web happen suggested that paragraphs have vertical space, and *maaayybe* an indent.  People following the standard implemented the must-haves and left out the optionals.  Also, this gem is from the same document:

> Documents should not contain tab characters, as they are not supported consistently.

Now, that comment has to do with preformatted text (think blocks of code), but it nonetheless reflects a thinking that is affecting us still today.  Back then, we didn't have a glorious, universal character set for the Web (UTF-8).  So something written on a Mac would look like crap on a Windows computer, and both would be a mess on a Unix/Linux computer.  And something from Japan would be unreadable on a US computer.  Nothing was interchangeable, everything broke.  So the Web guys basically said ""Screw it, anything that isn't A-Z or 0-9 is OUT.""  Tabs were not popular due to wonkiness.  That's an oversimplification, but if I want to stop typing anytime soon, it'll have to do.  :)

Other factors came into play quickly.  Forms were invented -- yes, invented; they didn't exist at first on the Web and were a revelation -- and tabbing from field to field was normal.  In addition, HTML was based upon SGML, and whitespace is designated to collapse in such specifications.  What this means is that if you put 2 spaces after a period, which I do, as all old people do, then the rules for the Web say ""collapse that down to 1.""  My 2 spaces are there, in the code under the Web page, but the *display* of my writing is different: everything is single spaces everywhere.  Same is *supposed* to go for tabs, carriage returns (new lines), and anything else that is white space.  If you put in a bunch of white space, it's supposed to collapse down to almost nothing.

So you have a bunch of people who got used to tab as a key to move through forms rather than a key to indent (and trying to submit text with a tab IN it is still difficult to this day), and you have tabs getting collapsed down to almost no space at all anyway thanks to the standards documents insisting it be so.  Because of this, we were almost forced to use carriage returns, as it was one of the only visually distinct ways to break up a document (and even that isn't truly reliable; don't get me started on the Windows/Mac/Linux differences in new lines and carriage returns).  It's a historical leftover and nobody has to follow it anymore, but just like roads being a set width thanks to wagons in ancient Rome, we follow it anyway.

**tl;dr** When we see a pretty Web page, underneath it's actually a super-ugly jumble of formatting codes that have a history of not respecting white space, and therefore the only ""big"" way to insert some visible organization was a carriage return."
184,TrueAskReddit,Received an Amber Alert notification on my cell phone last night. Is this system good or bad?,"It comes through the cell towers, so it is geographic.  It is a good system.

A lot of kidnappings aren't people attacking children, but custody disputes, and amber alerts are good for locating the getaway cars.

185,TrueAskReddit,Why do and how do people develop musical preferences?,"There’s a wonderful book called “this is your brain on music” by Daniel J Levitin. He says that your brain is making connections about the world around it- knowing the difference between cold and hot, high and low, red and blue- from birth till around jr. high when the brain looses some of Its elasticity. So the environment that people grow up in will have a big impact on what it thinks is “good music”. This is why Asian cultures appreciate a different scale and ideas of what is pleasing voice tone (Peking opera for instance). African cultures have a really complex rhythm system (using crazy time signatures like 12/8 and compound meters). The children grow up in those different musical systems and their brains become hard wired to like that style of music. 

(Interestingly, while meter and scale can vary wildly in different cultures, almost every culture operates with the octave - because mathematically, its a doubling of the frequency). 

So if you ask most people what is their favorite music (“what is the music of you heart”) many times they will identify music that was popular when they were in Jr High.  This isn’t to say that bo brains have no elasticity past jr high, but that the music we listen to up to that point really informed our brains as to what is “good music”.

So for those parents out there, one of the best things you can do is expose your kids to lots of different music styles. 

The challenge is that 200-300 years ago, music didn’t change that quickly. You had folk/tavern music (think of what you would sing around a campfire or in a tavern) and you had “high music” (think of classical music).  So people would have all appreciated very similar styles to one another. This would have greatly contributed to sociological cohesion and identity. But now with the rapid transfer of information, music styles change not even every generation, but even several times in one generation. So musical subcultures are more refined and specialized.  

While the variety of musical expressions is a good thing, I think we’ve lost how music can hold us together socially. "

188,TrueAskReddit,"Where and how did the now infamous ""Every child gets a trophy"" mentality start?","It was, like pretty much every other style of parenting since the Victorian era, thought to be the best way to rear a child at the time.  

Sometime during the Victorian era, roundabout the time that child labour laws started to be A Thing, people also realized that children weren't merely stupid miniature adults, but were cognitively and developmentally different and needed different treatment to produce better adults down the road.  

Notions that childhood events could affect the adult you'd end up being were absolutely new at the time.  Quite simply, some people took it for granted, others never thought about it, but no one had sat down and said ""children in X conditions in their childhood end up being Y kind of adults"" ... lots of these were absolutely wrong, to be sure, but the ideas were headed in the right direction.  

Ever since then, there's been whole waves and surges and fads of ways to raise children, each purporting to be better than others and each with its own advantages and pitfalls.  Most of these came about as a reaction to the style of parenting the current generation of parents were raised in.  

From here on in we get sweeping generalization-y.  No one person or upbringing embodies all of the traits I'm running through, but this is a colesnotes summary of general trends.  

The idea behind ""every child is special"" was a reaction to the environment that our parents were raised in, notably one where achieving tangible results and making pragmatic sacrifices was paramount.  They were raised to pursue ""solid"" careers, praised when they won awards, and chastised when they didn't win awards.  They were raised conformist, competitive, and to a black-and-white morality.  Ambition was encouraged in moderation, but inappropriate in quantity - aspiring for a promotion was good, but aspiring to take your boss' job was bad.  Concepts of class and station were tacitly encouraged, and many households had an almost militaristic discipline, as most parents of the era had lived through one or both world wars, and their values and the culture of the time were strongly shaped by those events.  

Our parents might have thrived in this environment had society sat still and remained fairly static following the wars.  Instead, the 60's happened.  Kids brought up in rigid formal conformist environments were tossed into North America's own cultural revolution: civil rights, feminism, the anti-war movement were all in full swing as our folks grew up.  

In the course of that, the ideals they'd been raised with were thrown into question - is that ""good"" but unfulfilling job *really* what you should be wanting or aspiring to?  Is having slightly nicer stuff than your suburban neighbors really the best metric of success available?  Why not follow your passions, and live content with whatever that pays you?  Because of the economic boom occurring at the time, it was possible for people to make a living doing all sort of things that the older generation wouldn't have considered a ""real job.""  But fundamentally, it was very apparent to our parents that the measures of success they'd been taught produced financially successful but ""spiritually"" miserable adults, both by observing their parents and their peers.  

So they resolved not to repeat the ""mistakes"" of their parents.  

...Instead, teaching their kids that they were special no matter what they chose to do as a job, that sometimes winning isn't actually all that matters, and that sometimes doing something because it's fun is as good a reason as you need.  

They praised us when we won, because winning is still winning.  But they praised us when we lost, because we'd still gone out and tried, and they praised us when everything went wrong because they wanted us to keep trying and to understand that sometimes you gotta keep losing to ever have a shot at winning.  

They understood that we're not all born equal, that some kids are bigger, faster, stronger, or otherwise advantaged, and other kids are similarly disadvantaged; they taught us to recognize both in ourselves and to focus on our strengths rather than mourning our weaknesses.  But they also taught us that just because we're outmatched is no cause to forfeit: simply trying is praiseworthy in and of itself.  "

190,TrueAskReddit,Is there some economic or political motivation behind the anti-vaccination movement?,"It started as general distrust of government and authority. Our flaw of viewing rich people as automatically smart has only fueled the movement, because there is no doubt that they made it worse. Rich and famous people looking for yet another way to take advantage of stupid people have had a field day with this distrust and misinformation. The wild conspiracies surrounding alternative medicine, healing auras, essential oils... you name it. There is tons of money to be made in this. And if you can get on the radio or a 10 am talk show with someone who has reach and influence (for example Oprah) then you can make sure that whatever you say wont even be questioned until years after the fact. The “marketplace of ideas” doesnt mean much when people just bounce around from promoted bad idea to promoted bad idea and the good ideas are just lost in the noise. 

The movement has inherently ingrained bias against anyone that speaks poorly of it. If Google only has results showing vaccines are ok then the reaction is “CENSORSHIP!!!” If a radio show personality talks how vaccines work they have “been paid off by someone” and this someone is usually “big pharma” or whatever.

Others have already said this too but the image that someone else is responsible for things instead of bad luck, genetics, or themselves is also a big driver of all this

195,TrueAskReddit,Why does the USA not have a gun license in the vein of Driver's Licences?,"Obviously I can't speak for everyone, but this is what I see and hear from my circle of friends and family. And just for full disclosure, I do own a gun - a .22 single shot. Fire, reload, fire, reload, that I use for target shooting occasionally. I live in a region that is filled with hunters - deer, turkey, squirrel, rifle, black powder, bow, etc - so I like to think I hear a lot of the arguments being made against licensing or a registry. 

First off, many gun owners aren't opposed to licensing. They do agree that it would be a pain for them, a ""fix"" that wouldn't really fix anything. The accidents you mention happen to a percentage of a percentage of gun owners in the US - that's how many guns there are. However, they agree - and this is the camp I'm personally in - that there are just some people out there who should not be allowed to own guns. I'm sure everyone knows someone they'd be terrified of if that person owned a gun. Now, how to go about deciding who those people are is a totally different story, and I won't get into it right now - I'll only speak to the licensing bits. 

One argument against licensing is that it could then be used to create a registry - that someone, somewhere in the US Gov't would know who owns every (legally purchased) gun in the US. And if the time came that the gov't decided people shouldn't have guns, this would make it that much easier for them to track them down and take them. 

It may seem far-fetched, but there were reports post-Katrina of police and National Guard units confiscating guns from people who, last I heard, never got them back. Again, I know this is a rare circumstance, there was looting, people weren't safe - I'm aware.

And then there is the bit in the Constitution: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

This was written in the times that everyone had guns because you couldn't go down to the local Publix and buy a pound of hamburger. It was written at a time when you couldn't pull a trigger and spray off 40 rounds a second. It was written at a time when the US didn't have a standing army - it was entirely made up of volunteers who had their own weapons, and they were ""well regulated"" in the sense that they were organized by state and then divisions. This wasn't the same type of militia that's causing the scene in Oregon at the moment. 

Now, I'm not saying most gun owners who are anti-registry are beer-swilling, pickup-driving, white-hood wearing militia types. They're clearly not - again, these are a very, very small percentage of gun owners. But that is one of the arguments. 

Some people are anti-registry because they feel that the background checks would be too invasive. As of now (in most states - this may vary), when you buy a gun you are asked to fill out a form. That form asks if you've ever been committed to a mental institution or have committed a felony. I don't know the exact wording, so don't quote me on those, but that's what it's asking for. As of right now, if you see a therapist/doctor/psychiatrist/psychologist/whoever that thinks you shouldn't own a gun because you're a danger to yourself or others, they can only go to the police, and that's only if they think someone is in immediate danger. (Again, this may vary from state-to-state.) One of the proposed changes is that mental health issues, domestic violence charges/convictions, etc are added to background checks. Some people claim that just because they got in a fight with their wife 15 years ago and she got a restraining order, now they'll never be able to own a gun. Because they work in a call center and are depressed as hell because they work 50 hours a week and still barely get by, they're prescribed Zoloft or Prozac, and that may keep them from being able to own a gun. 

The arguments on that are something that would have to be looked into very deeply. Mental illness still carries such a stigma in this country that a lot of people don't want to admit to having it in the first place, much less have others know about it who can block their ""right"" to own a gun. (I put right in quotes to begin with, but that looks like I'm being a smug asshole, and I'm really not.)

Others are okay with the background checks as long as they're instant. These checks are currently carried out by licensed dealers, not by individual sellers (this is the gun-show loophole). Some argue that the loophole is not a loophole because it's not circumventing the law. Either way, people can sell guns to other people without having to do a background check. One of the proposed solutions would be to open background checks to everyone who was selling a weapon, but then you have anyone at all who can access background checks. So they need to be licensed dealers. Well, that won't work because when you go to gun shows there's not always a phone connection, an internet connection or whatever to run the background check. 

And again, these checks have to be instant to be accepted (by some). As of right now (again, state-to-state applies, I think), to buy a handgun in my state you have to fill out an application for the background check, then wait three days. Well, the FBI (I think is who does them - if not, correct me) has a finite number of people who they can put into the background check position. Once they're busy, they're busy - others stack up. If you apply for the handgun and your background check isn't back in three days, they can still sell you the weapon. So instant background checks would be literally almost impossible - without a registry, which brings us back to the other argument. 

When I was in school many moons ago, we actually had firearm safety class. You had to complete it before you could get a hunting license. This clearly didn't stop anyone from not practicing gun safety, but it's a start. Most states that issue concealed carry permits require several hours of classroom training, and there are gun clubs all over the country who I'm sure would love to give safety classes. The more people know about guns, the less they become scared of them. Not that they don't respect them - I don't mean that they shouldn't be careful with them, just that they won't have a heart attack if they're in a restaurant and some guy happens to be carrying. The media doesn't help by labeling things as assault rifles and tactical this and that.

So that's what I get from my friends and family. I can see some points on both sides of all the arguments, so I don't really get into them. If someone starts the gun argument at a family gathering, I just head to the kitchen to get more food. 

Hope this gives you some information you may not have had!

196,TrueAskReddit,"Once all production is done by machines, could communism actually work?","Apparently this was Marx's original vision for Communism. If you've ever read any of Iain M. Banks' science fiction novels, Marx's ""Grundrisse"" was part of his inspiration for The Culture.

The polymath Richard Buckminster Fuller envisaged a similar future once what he called ""technology of super-abundance"" had been achieved.

Prior to industrialisation, large parts of Britain were classed as ""common"" or ""waste"" ground, unowned by anyone. They were typically used by landless peasants for subsistence farming. A key part of the origin of modern capitalism can be found in the enclosure acts in the UK, which gave the property rights of this land to wealthy private owners. Although there were enclosures previously, the process accelerated significantly in the late 18th century. A large part of the motivation for this, which the British ruling class discussed quite openly, was to drive the peasants off the land and into the factories, creating a class of dependant ""wage slaves"" who had no choice, but to sell their labour in order to survive. (Note, the British rulers didn't use the term ""wage slave"", but they were unabashed about their goal of creating dependence.)

Clearly mechanisation holds the promise of reversing this shift, allowing individuals to support themselves outside of capitalism. However, as others in this thread have noted, a huge amount of scarcity in our modern world is largely the result of political decisions, rather than technical lack, and any communist society would require substantial redistribution of land and capital.

Given the leaked information on the Intellectual Property section of the Trans Pacific Partnership(TPP), it seems the Plutocracy is determined to maintain a system of power through scarcity, even if it has to create scarcity in the super-abundance of information.

**tl;dr** Yes, but only if greedy people don't fuck it up with bad politics."

He had experience, but no formal training in anything -- only a high school diploma.

On one level, we all know this stuff already. It's been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.

>Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful, it's that they're unconscious. They are default settings.

Worth reading/listening to. I certainly buy into it.

200,TrueAskReddit,Is the proposed border wall a red herring? Why shouldn't we equally turn our focus to the many American employers who are willing to accept illegal immigrant labor?,"From the ""Great Wall of China"" to the ""Iron Curtain"" these things have been a huge drain on  resources and have never worked. One of the last things we need right now is a trade war with Mexico. 

If we get rid of the Mexicans who will do the work they do? If your answer is domestic labor then how much more are you willing to pay for your basic needs? Anyone willing to work 4am to 8am and 4pm to 8pm seven days a week on a dairy farm for minimum wage with no benefits? 

The most likely results will we send the Mexicans back and import the products they make in Mexico rather than letting them work here. If you like being dependent on  imported oil, you will love being dependent on imported food. "
201,TrueAskReddit,Why is the N-word derogatory but not self deprecating?,"The best answer to this question I said to a friend is this.

So you make friends with guys and through H.S. you do some very stupid stuff. This stuff bonds your friendship. Since you guys are kids, penis, fart, butt plug and douche comes out as endearing(joking) terms. Turn out your nickname becomes asswipe or dickwart( again only in your tight group of friends).

When they call you like that, you don't want your family, teachers, or some stranger across the street to call you dickwart. But you let it slide for your friends because you go wayyy back. 

Also you know that the nickname dickwart is always meant in a friendly way, your friends won't call you like that in the middle of an argument or to insult you.

You are with your friends having  some drinks and one of them goes, "" Guys remember when /r/Paragora did this hilariously stupid thing that got us all grounded/suspended for a couple a days? Man was that funny! Why did you think this would work? Danm dickwart, always trying to save a situation by making it worse! HAHAHA."" See how there is nothing wrong with it?

On an other day comes that one guy who you really don't know that well  and for some reason you are having an argument. Out of no where he calls you a fucking dickwart. You know he's not reffering to you like your close friends because he sure isn't and he keeps insulting you so things escalate. 

This is the same thing with the N-Word, the Dyke word, the Wops(IIRC and Italian who lost his roots), Gringo (IIRC a Brazilian without his roots or a tourist),  and other derogatory words in every culture. It's endearing in a group that is a minority but derogtory to those who didn't live in this culture.

I can garantee you that even among black folks, one stranger calling the other an ignorant n* doing N* shit will get the same result as any other person saying N*.

So to clear this out, it has a lot to do with the way the one being called n* perceives it. It is still an insulting word even coming from someone you know but friends and such you grew up with tend to get a pass on it **because they know not to use it in a way to hurt you**. 

To add to this, I can't say it's a black culture thing, it's with all cultures. A person with insecurities who grew up in a rather poor ghetto( be it a trailer park, an affordable housinf projet or any other ghetto type of concentration) will want to grow up to keep the good part of his culture but leave the bad part( like the stereotypes being said by the people of the race in power(Politicians CEO and such)) behind.  By calling them Trailer thrash, redneck, n*, Whop or whatever the word applies to his race, you are telling him that he is a regression, someone who is still living and acting like a poor bottom of the barrel no class immigrant instead of having gone up a couple of class higher( adapting to living in a new country is already a class higher).

So this will bring some insecurities in some and those are the one making the news for it.

For the many who do make the news for reacting violently, there are as many[who keep their calm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-QnUPvsK8o) 

TLDR: It's a bad word by default used in a good way by those around you. If you are looking to feel what it is like, just look in your culture what are the bad words that represents the bottom of the barell people but can be an endearment when used among your friends.

Edit: wow this blew up glad it helped! Thanks for the Midas Touch!"
202,TrueAskReddit,"Are today's largest states (China, India, USA) too populated to effectively govern? Are higher populations correlated with more corrupt and inefficient national governments?","There are 37 countries with populations in excess of thirty-five million, 50 with populations between thirty-five and ten million, and 156 countries with populations under ten million.

203,TrueAskReddit,"Why does genetic engineering elicit such a rabid and negative response in so many people? There seems to be an intentional culture of denial, misinformation and demonization surrounding the entire field of genetics. Why?","I wouldn't say I'm rabidly negative, but I am cautious around genetic tinkering. There's one big reason - The Law of Unintended Consequences. 

Too often we've seen scientific advances that, after some time, we learn have had negative impacts. Even something as small as the changes in our diets that seem to have caused an obesity epidemic are a good example; we know *something*'s to blame, but it's hard to know what. Genetic engineering is of a similar vein; there will be changes that have negative consequences but it'll be hard to identify which, or how - and how to mitigate them."
204,TrueAskReddit,"Why do I have to wait hours to see a doctor in the U.S. when I made an appointment a few days prior? Why, then, do they always seem to be in a rush?","Medical student here, just a few of the zillion reasons:

1) Terrible reimbursement rates for office visits = doctors need to book a lot of patients into a day to keep afloat. This is hopefully something that changes with all the healthcare reforms, because it's one of the biggest problems right now in primary car.

2) No-shows: patients skip appointments ALL. THE. TIME. I've been to some clinics where up to half of the appointments for the day don't show up (this is a poor immigrant area, I'm sure it's better in other communities, but still a problem). Docs then need to overbook so they aren't paying staff to sit around in an empty clinic, which can of course lead to very busy days in the off chance that everyone shows up.

3) ""At the door questions"": it's not infrequent for someone to spend an entire office visit describing their mild cold symptoms, and then when the doc is wrapping up / walking out the door the patient will remember that they've been vomiting blood for the last week. 

4) Charting takes up SO MUCH TIME. Depending on the hospital system and Electronic medical record, it can take almost as long to chart an uncomplicated office visit as it takes to perform one.

5) Patient phone calls, emergencies, etc

That's just a few of them off the top of my head, but really the bottom line is that unfortunately doctors are being pulled in a thousand different directions by patients, their supervisors, insurance companies, their families, their staff, etc and it means that they can't spend as much time with each patient as they would like. There's a lot of ideas being kicked around for unloading some of the burden on primary care doctors, and hopefully in the next few years we start to see some of them being successfully implemented.

What would it be?,They believe in a religious prophecy that basically says the armies of the west will be destroyed in a pillar of fire in a biblical location corresponding roughly with modern day Syria.  They are trying to provoke the west into attacking them because they need to literally draw the armies of the west to the proper location in order for this to happen.  Their actions make a whole lot of sense when you realize it's deliberate provocation with the goal of fulfilling the prophecy in mind.

208,TrueAskReddit,Why can't companies (Like Lavabit) simply refuse to disclose the information the NSA is demanding?,"An excellent question... where to start?

* The above-all, catch-all answer is that politicians are slimy and build exceptions into **everything** - everything you're mentioning is essentially guided by an exception

* The founding fathers even made clear that treason was not protected by the First Amendment

* A modern limitation on the First Amendment involves a 'clear and present danger', like yelling 'FIRE' in a crowded theater

* The 5th Amendment covers something that would incriminate yourself'- essentially it means that the government can't bully you into making a confession (esp. of something you may not have committed), or get you in trouble for keeping your mouth shut about where you were on ___ night whewhatever crime was committed.  So if it relates to evidence that someone else did, then it's not really covered here

* Why can't companies disclose their battles with the NSA?  Because our politicians are awful, and at least half of them live a delusional life, as if every single day is an episode of '24'.  See, we need the NSA because terrorists.  But it has to be secret, or it won't work.  And if you disclose the fact that the NSA wants user data, then you're exposing their program, which is an act of espionage, so you're a terrorist.  And if you're a terrorist, then you're not protected by our Amendments

Awesome logic, isn't it?


Essentially it's a combination of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Foreign Intelligence Survellance Act that gives the government so much power.  The 'snuff' orders are part of National Security Letters from the Patriot Act.

As far as party lines go on spying and surveillance, Republicans are in landslide favor of more spying (>90% total votes in favor of Patriot Act extensions, FISA extensions, etc), while Democrats are pret evenly split (roughly 50% for and against more spying).

On my tablet so not in the mood to go grabbing links from everywhere, but that should be enough to get you started, and hopefully someone else can elaborate."
209,TrueAskReddit,Why was Germany one of the countries most spied upon by the NSA?,"Of course this is only based on speculation due to the lack of citable sources but i suspect it goes along the following lines:

* Germany being the most influential power in the european union and thus shaping their foreign and domestic policies especially in regards to armed conflicts, handling of the economical crisis and stance towards the Arabian Spring revolutions.

* Due to a high amount of muslim residents it could be feared by the US to serve as a radicalization platform for extremists. A part of the 9/11 perpetrators lived and planned in Germany.

* Protection of Privacy and Data Security are among the big values of Germany so the possibilites of the German Intelligence Agency (BND= *Bundesnachrichtendienst* literally: federal news services) are limited, so the US could see the German information gathering machine as unsufficient and stepped in to fix this. Also Germany could have requested information they are unable to obtain due to above mentioned restrictions (highly speculative).
 
* There are elections soon in Germany and even though everthing indicates a 3rd term for Merkel it could be useful to know the exact attitude of every party involved towards the US.

* As a succesful industrialized and innovative nation Germany is historically a big target for industrial espionage.

* A major concentration of internet cables and data centers is in Frankfurt am Main. The majority of all Internet traffic in Europe passes through there. 

Those are more or less the reasons, most likely it is a combination but until we know the nature of the information gathered (political, economical, surveillance of individuals...) it is hard to determine the intentions of the NSA."
210,TrueAskReddit,"Redditors who live in countries with universal healthcare, what is healthcare like for mental health?","UK here, sufferer of Psychotic Depression. It's not bad, but there's a lot of room for improvement. Medication is fairly pricey, and there's definitely a stigma regarding mental health (I, along with friends, have been treated as less important, or at least it has felt that way). Physical illness seems to get much higher priority. However, I am provided with free counselling and with appropriate medication (after a few cock ups) so I have no real complaints."
211,TrueAskReddit,What are ways Americans with their nose to the grindstone can tell whether the economy is doing good or bad?,"I work at a car dealership. 2019 has been slower than 2018. People are nervous. They aren't committing to long term debt like cars as easily. Also, you can see housing sales slowing down. I think that we feel it earlier than most people because we sell big ticket items. 

One problem is most of us hear the word ""recession"" and think of 2008/2009. It's possible for us to have a recession that doesn't cause widespread unemployment and crisis, though."
212,TrueAskReddit,"Why do we find information interesting? Is it some kind of heuristic, however indirect, for usefulness?","**This is not a source-based answer.** I could be wrong, or overlooking something.

Without information, how do we navigate our scary world? If we can't predict whether something bad will happen, we don't have enough information. If we can't understand why something good happened, we need to learn why.

---

So, people who enjoyed learning probably tended to do better than those who didn't. You didn't know when it would come in handy, even if it didn't lead to immediate action. But generally: Good information = good decisions, Bad information = bad decisions, No information = no decisions.

Alternatively, we also fear/dislike the opposite of information: the unknown. What's around the corner? What's out there in the dark? Why are my friends dying?"
213,TrueAskReddit,Finnish education is said to be among the best in the world. How do Finnish students do when studying at non-Finnish universities?,"Finn here. Our education is ""the best"" because it produces consistent results across the entire population. In principle, everyone has equal opportunity (and legally, until age 15, a duty) to learn. In practice, this means that weak students get support to perform at the average level, but also that top students aren't really encouraged beyond the average either. This gives good results in international comparisons, but doesn't mean our students are somehow exceptionally bright. Especially if they were just suddenly thrown into an entirely different culture, they probably wouldn't do very well.

However, the ones who actually do go on to study abroad will naturally be among the most motivated and skilled individuals, so any anecdotes will be biased by that. Studying in a Finnish university myself, I can likewise tell stories about amazing students from places like Russia and Turkey. Those aren't generally renowned for their education. :)"
214,TrueAskReddit,Why am I more interested/passionate about being successful in/at video games than real life?,"Video games are designed to reward you at the right time to feel good about your accomplishments.

Also, games have a guaranteed possibility for a successful outcome when real life has no guarantees.  You know you can be successful at a game but real life is much scarier."

216,TrueAskReddit,How can magazines like the National Enquirer print obviously fake stories about celebrities without it being considered libel?,"Because of the ""actual malice"" standard in First Amendment law. Celebrities are ""public figures,"" and so discussions about them are a matter of public concern, and thus to win in a defamation claim, the celebrity has to prove the defendant acted with ""actual malice.""

In the vast majority of these cases, the Enquirer has some sort of plausibly-credible source for the allegation, and so will be able to successfully defend against the allegation they acted with ""actual malice."" 

More to the point, few celebrities want to open themselves up to ""discovery"" in the litigation they would bring. If you were, say, Tom Cruise, would you want to voluntarily expose your personal life — including putting yourself under oath at a deposition — to a lawyer for the National Enquirer?

Edited to add: If you want to see an example of some of these issues at work, see this case involving Clint Eastwood: http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14234948414064403285 The bar is quite high — not impossibly high, but high. 

Also notice who the outside counsel for the Enquirer is: David Kendall. If you recognize the name, it's because, at the same time, he was also representing President Clinton in his impeachment. The Enquirer doesn't mess around when it comes to First Amendment law. "
217,TrueAskReddit,How is politics in so many countries so broken? Why is it an avenue for even the uneducated and ignorant to come into power?,"When times are tough, people get frustrated with those in power and vote for something different in the hopes it will bring about change. It's an act of desperation and hopefulness rather than one of stupidity or carelessness. 

Take 1930s Germany for example. The economy was a shit show, the country was a mess. Along came a radical politician with new ideas that represented change and hope for the country.

220,TrueAskReddit,Would normalizing nudity be beneficial for society?,"I'm from Germany - depending on your family and environment growing up, the relationship with nudity is a lot more relaxed than in other regions of the world. There are public baths here with huge sauna areas, 15-20 different saunas, pools etc. and they are all nudist, no swimwear allowed and people move around freely fully naked. I'll answer your question having the general vibe of those places in mind.

* Crime: There is still the problem of people smuggling cameras/phones. Why do people still do that, even though they could go back any time to see more naked people? Because it's forbidden, because it gives them power over others, to keep seeing them nude whenever they want, even when the other isn't there anymore or dressed up again. Say we had no clothes at all, there would still be stalkers, obsessed, it would still be sexual for them and it would still be a crime. Same with people masturbating in public - it would still be taboo, but there would still be airheads that blame the victim of ""teasing"", trying to make them accountable for their own actions when they get caught.

* Shame: I grew up in a household, where it was normal to see each other naked, and there was no taboo. Still I remember a time growing up, when I started to feel uncomfortable with the nudity of my dad, when it had never been made into a ""thing"". So naturally, I started to keep more distance and that was accepted. When I was a teenager, I also didn't want to be seen nude anymore by mom. I became self-conscious about myself. Not that I felt shameful about my body, it just happened. Later I relaxed again, nudity with my sibblings was never too weird, but since my relationship with my mom is difficult, I don't like her seeing me naked. Even if nudity wasn't linked that closely to sex anymore, it still has to do with vulnerability, intimacy. If we were all nude all the time, maybe that would simply be expressed by keeping more distance to others, or use more formal language, which are other ways to distance yourself socially. But shame is a human emotion that doesn't necessarily have to do with nudity. Also for the male perspective: If we were all naked all the time, random boners would still be shameful. Because it shows sexual arousal, which is a very private emotion, and may be socially inappropriate at times.

* ""Men feel they achieve something when they see a woman's body. This encourages aggressive behavior"" - if we were nude all the time, men would still see it as an accomplishment to ""convince"" a woman to have sex with them, which would then encourage aggressive behavior, as long as they are ""encouraged"" to think that way. This is a problem that has to do with our minds and thoughts, not our bodies. 

* Body and health awareness: I agree in principle. The more varied the sample of natural, naked bodies you see in your life, the more realistic will your expectations will be, how your own body should be like. Of course it doesn't take away that certain people are praised for their beauty and just have more attractive bodies than yours, and the media show you both more extreme bodies and the social hype around that. People will never be fully satisfied with themselves. And while the base of the ""average"" might be broader with more examples, jealousy wouldn't go away.

* teenage pregnancy: That has less to do with nudity, and more with imparting knowledge how things work in a friendly setting that invites questions. In Germany we have pop-magazine for teenagers. Part of it are the pages of ""Dr. Summer"": when I was a teen, there was a whole pages with Q&A all about sex, and then also a doublepage with a full frontal nude selfie of a boy and a girl, where you could *gasp* see a flaccid penis! And boobies!! I don't know any stats about teenage pregnancy in Germany, but it's not really a hot topic.

TLDR: Humans will be humans - more nudity in my opinion won't eradicate feelings such as shame, power, jealousy or lust and the implications of it. But a more relaxed attitude might -surprise!- make people more relaxed overall."
221,TrueAskReddit,Why weren't helicopters used to save people on the top floors of the World Trade Center on 9/11?,"Convection. 

Those huge buildings put out a terrifying amount of heat. All that heat goes into the air, all that air rises up.

222,TrueAskReddit,"In a world with free Wi-Fi , will mobile phone networks become extinct?","The problem with free WiFi is that you're at the behest of whoever is running the connection. For instance if they want to track what you do and sell it to marketers you're not given an option of opting out. 

Having a mobile network means that your internet access it tied to one ISP so to speak.

With the way 4G and future 5G standards are moving the quality of mobile phone internet will be near or reach the level of a home connection. That will be the ideal situation especially for remote areas where WiFi range may be a few hundred metres but a mobile transmitter can reach 10s of kilometres. "
223,TrueAskReddit,Why does it matter in politics if politicians have affairs?,"I think it's more a matter of how they lie and cover it up that shows their true character, not the affair itself."
224,TrueAskReddit,should individuals feel an obligation to stop listening to music of bands/artists that have sexual assault allegations against them?,"There’s more than 2 options—you can hold both as truth. Because they are. 

I think a parallel here is another artist: Dr. Seuss. Just because he made some racist and offensive political cartoons in the past, it doesn’t mean that all of his other work should be burned. Nor does it mean he should get a pass and that bad stuff be forgotten. I actually teach my child that the same man did both things, good and bad. I think it helps kids better understand the real world and why people make bad choices. And that they can choose to still make better ones."
225,TrueAskReddit,"Realistically, what are the most likely changes we'll see under the Trump administration?","One big change I think people gloss over is the Supreme Court appointment. Trump's appointment will likely lock the court down as way more conservative than the general population, and with the two oldest judges being on the liberal side, we can probably expect it to stay that conservative for at least the next decade. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this makes the court feel a bit bolder in their agenda.

Current LGBT rights are probably safe at the judicial level, but gun control, environmental issues, and roe v. wade could easily find themselves on the chopping block in the next few years."
226,TrueAskReddit,Would free public gyms have any effect on obesity in the US?,"I don't think it'd make a noticeable difference. Not everyone has enough motivation, some people might be too obese to actually go to the gym, and dieting is also an important factor. Exercise is free and encouraged, but if public diet stays the same then there won't be much weight loss."
227,TrueAskReddit,How does one begin to buy stocks?,"There are a lot of things to consider before jumping into the stock market.  I'll see if I can list a few important things to keep in mind:

1. Any money that you put into the stock market (your principal) is subject to potential losses, up to 100% of your principal.  This means that you can't lose more than you put in (if you're investing in stocks like you implied above), but you can lose ALL of what you put in if you choose poorly.

2. When you buy stock, you pay a certain price per share.  For instance, GE stock is currently worth $23.58 per share.  The goal that you're most familiar with when it comes to stock trading (presumably) is the increase in value of a stock from the time that you purchased it to the time you decide to sell it.  This is considered a 'bullish' position on a stock ([hence the Wall Street bull](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/8b/a2/a4/charging-bull-wall-street.jpg)).  The opposite of a 'bullish' position is a 'bearish' position.  This is basically taking a pessimistic view of a stock.  Some people choose to engage in '[short selling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_\(finance\))' on stocks to take advantage of the anticipated price drop by borrowing stocks at one price and returning those stocks later at a lower price than they borrowed them for.

3. TAXES: When you buy a stock, the proceeds that you get by selling that stock are subject to two different tax brackets, depending on how long you held that stock.  Let's say that you bought one share of GE tomorrow for $23.58.  Next week, GE announces a fusion reactor that will fuel the planet in perpetuity and the price of a share of GE jumps to $2358.00 and you sell the stock.  Since you held the stock for less than one year, the gain on the sale of that stock is taxed like normal income.  If you're in the 25% tax bracket, that means you will be paying around $583 of your $2334.42 before tax gain to the federal government.  On the other hand, let's say that you held on to that one share of GE for one whole year and sold it on April 17, 2014; 53 weeks after you purchased it.  In this case, the gain on your stock sale is taxed as a 'capital gain'.  Capital gains tax is currently 15% for single filers with an income rate of $36,250 - $200,000 (0% below that) or 20% for single filers with incomes above $400,000 or married couples with incomes over $450,000.  This tax impact should be considered before you start buying and selling stocks often because you will pay more tax on the proceeds from stocks held less than one year than those held longer than one year.

4. There is no way to predict what will happen in the stock market tomorrow.  As many sources as there are that try to predict what's going to happen on any given day in the stock market, no average trader can accurately predict tomorrow's market prices today.  Do NOT take advice from people who claim otherwise or you will probably get robbed.

5.  With most reputable stocks, you can hope to make between 4-7% on your investment in a normal year (not like 2008-2009).  This is a stark contrast to the relative safety of US Treasury Bonds ([current yield](http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us/) is 0.23% for a two-year bond....that's next to nothing.  It won't beat inflation so you would lose money in the long run by keeping your money tied up in treasuries).  This also means that if someone is guaranteeing you a 20% return on investment (ROI), they're probably full of shit or running a Ponzi scheme like Bernie Madoff or something crazy.  Don't get involved with those clowns.

6.  Diversify! You don't want all your eggs in one basket.  If you have 100% of your stock funds tied up in tech stocks and another dot com bubble bursts, you could stand to lose all of your investment (principal).  If you had half of that tied up in something like retail on the other hand, you wouldn't be nearly as affected by a tech bubble burst.

There are literally hundreds of other things to add to this response, but this is at least a start.  Be careful when picking your stocks, but the earlier you start investing the more likely you are to make your money work for you.  You will appreciate that later when you live on an island in the Caribbean.

They were entering the job market at a time when the social contract of life-long employment was unraveling. Many of these kids were left to grow up alone (i.e. ""latchkey kids"").

230,TrueAskReddit,Can modern Society collapse like the Western Roman Empire ?,"Yes, the post-industrial globalized society can  and will eventually collapse like the fall of Rome or the Bronze Age collapse. Possibly in our lifetime unless we either find an energy source with better energy return on energy invested (EROIE) than fossil fuels (aka fusion energy) and we can not only limit the damage from environmental degradation, pollution, and climate change but reverse it. However some will say that it is futile and collapse is inevitable because of Jevons Paradox (increase capacity/efficiency leads to increased use).

The alternative to the business as usual would be to limit both the growth of our population, economy, and therefore energy use, which I believe is unlikely given human history and human nature (see Prisoner’s dilemma). It would also lead to a decline of civilization, which is what we’re trying to avoid here. 

Simply put, there are far too many people consuming too much in an increasingly complex (or energy expensive) society given the limited resources on this planet. This has been modeled in [Limits to Growth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth) over 50 years ago, with industrial output, food per capita, and population decreasing drastically while pollution increases. 

[Joseph Tainter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainter) takes it further by arguing we are seeing diminishing returns in not only energy but resource extraction and innovation as well. As society becomes more and more expensive just to maintain the status quo, there comes a point where too much energy is required just to keep the system going. 

That’s not to say that we are fated to be doomed, societies have staved off collapse through long term resource/population planning and cultural adaptation that Jared Diamond mentions in [Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_to_Fail_or_Succeed). There are also numerous cases of indigenous tribes living in a symbiotic relationship with their habitat. Also keep in mind that Thomas Malthus has been proved wrong (so far) by advancements in human innovation and capacity especially through the Industrial and Borlaug’s Green Revolution. 

And even if society collapses, it’s not necessarily a bad thing. The Renaissance and the Enlightenment advanced society more than Rome ever could, and that also goes for Classical Greece or Rome after the Bronze Age collapse. I would like to believe people can learn from our past and we aren’t doomed to repeat history. 

However, I do think we are entering an Age of Consequences as a result of overshooting Earth’s carrying capacity. Economic Inequality, ecological collapse, political polarization and paralyzation are all different sides of the same problem. 

And this time collapse may be different in that it is total; it will affect every nation AT THE SAME TIME because we are effectively turning the biosphere into people or the things people need.  

Here are some lectures from people much smarter than I am explaining it much better than I ever could.

231,TrueAskReddit,Is the present the most anti-alcohol and anti-nudity era in the post-1970 history of the world?,"About the topless in Europe part: I think it has much to do with the existence of phones with cameras and the internet.

232,TrueAskReddit,Why is marijuana considered a gateway drug while alcohol is not?,"Marijuana has been the subject of a fierce PR battle to ensure people think it's terrible. Why that is is the subject of much debate, and what you believe probably depends on who you're listening to. I think a good summary of that whole discussion is: A lot of powerful people make a lot of money because alcohol is legal and a lot of powerful people make a lot of money because marijuana is illegal. 

But the reason the gateway theory became popular is that ""Most hard drug users use marijuana before trying harder drugs."" This is silly for obvious reasons. (Most hard drug users also eat bread before trying hard drugs as well. Most marijuana users do not go on to use hard drugs.) 

Very few legitimate sources actually believe the ""gateway"" theory any more. "
233,TrueAskReddit,How can we realistically curb the amount of shootings occurring in the U.S.?,"There's a lot of stuff here that I think is good.  Top rated comment right now is about the mental health system.  That's great.

Then there are people talking about problems with racial inequality, and that is also spot on and great.

So I'm going to confine my comments to something that doesn't get talked about much.  America is just a violent ass country.  I grew up there.  All through elementary and high school I was getting in to fights.  Lots of kids did.  When I moved to Germany as an adult I was surprised to find out that most Germans go through their entire lives without ever getting into a fist fight.

But that's just something we accept.  Sure, we've started cracking down on bullying etc., and that's great, but even so American children are exposed to more violence than people in other industrialized countries and we accept it as normal.  

What is more we encourage it.  Most other countries do not have school sporting teams but in America it's a big deal if you can get onto the team.  Especially football is a huge deal in a lot of high schools.  I remember walking into my school cafeteria when I was 16 and watching the team psyche themselves up before a big game.  They were working themselves into a fury.  They weren't talking about winning.  They were talking about ""killing"" the other team.  It was extremely unsettling.

And look at how we treat soldiers.  I understand that someone who fights to defend your country deserves to have their sacrifice recognized, but we raise our military up like almost no other country I can think of.  I know plenty of Europeans who will buy a vet a beer, but none who wear ribbons or who hold soldiers up as examples to extremely young boys.

We weren't always like this.  Somewhere along the line we went from maintaining a very small standing army to a country that keeps spends more on it's military than everyone else put together.  Somehow we think it's normal and even take pride in it.  The only manufacturing that we do anymore is weapons.  Our only real export is war.  Why are we surprised when that bleeds over into our daily life?

Your brain has learned this, and compensates for it. However, you can still see them if you want to:

* Take a piece of card, make a small hole in it with a pin. Alternatively, curl up your index finger so that there's just a small hole in the middle.
* Close one eye and hold the piece of card in front of the other eye. 
* Wave the card back and fore whilst looking at a white screen or wall.

If you get the speed of waving right, you'll be able to see the shadows created by the blood vessels on your retina.

235,TrueAskReddit,Has anyone thought how different today would be from one insignificant decision or factor that happened many years ago?,"I missed my application to grad school because the deadline was at noon and I thought it was midnight. Ended up pursuing a different graduate degree at another university, dropping out, working half a year and then pursuing a degree similar to the first at a third university. In addition to finishing my education a year later; at my final university, I worked on a few projects that qualified me for my current job. I'd be in a completely different place if I'd opened that application form two hours earlier.

Also, I have kids. But if I'd had sex at a different time or maybe even in a different position, another sperm might have won the race and I'd have different kids. Same goes for me, you, anyone else. A slight change would mean non-existence.

238,TrueAskReddit,"People have taken to saying ""This is exactly what ISIS wants"" when talking about Islamophobia, fear mongering, and the degradation of civil liberties. Is this actually what Daesh wants?","   For sure. 

   The more Muslims are alienated and shown that the West hates them, the easier they are to radicalize. Take for example the situation in France. The living standards for immigrants is anything but ideal, more often they're forced into ghettos which become breeding grounds for extremists to find shunned youth to convert. Even people born on French soil but in the banlieues grow up with a warped sense of us vs them. Add in islamophobia, which further the divide between the groups and there you have it.

   Daesh also hates the fact people are leaving Syria. If you read the Dabiq you'll see their ""confusion"". More islamophobia, less acceptance of refugees, more people stuck under their thumb. Another reason why countries that are welcoming to refugees are more at risk. "
239,TrueAskReddit,What do the people of North Korea think is happening in the outside world?,"1. It is a totalitarian state, and therefore the average North Korean's knowledge of the outside world is specifically tailored in a certain way. The regime will admit to some economic failings, but they certainly don't teach average North Koreans that NK languishes economically compared to the vast majority of the developed world. And so North Koreans may get some sense that not everything is perfect economically (90s famines are still a living memory), but probably don't understand just how truly backwards the country is. 

2. [There is a prevalent black market through which western goods are reaching the hands of ordinary Koreans more and more commonly.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9258974/North-Koreans-secretly-watching-foreign-media.html) These allow North Koreans to watch SK movies, dramas, and other visual clues demonstrating the inferiority of the NK economy. [The totalitarian regime is trying to crackdown on these smuggled DVDs, because they realize that it undermines their official party line.](http://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/radios-02282014160921.html) However, the black market has become a pervasive and socially acceptable part of daily North Korean life among ordinary North Koreans after the collapse of their food distribution systems in the 90s. This means that their efforts will probably be futile, as the avenues being utilized to trade DVDs and USBs are also vital for fuel, food, medicine, etc because the North Korean regime is simply no longer able to distribute it effectively themselves. Foreign media will continue to proliferate, and in doing so will continue to be at odds with what the party tells North Koreans. They will basically have to choose what to believe, foreign media or the party?

3. North Korean elites in Pyongyang have already enjoyed access to foreign media for some time, and most likely have a fairly good grasp as to the disparities between North Korean and South Korea economically. 

As to your questions:

>How much do they learn in school?

They learn what the party allows them to hear in school, and so schooling for ordinary NK citizens will not give them a solid grasp as to the true economic realities for North Korea and around the world. 

>What kind of internet access (if any) do they get?

Ordinary North Koreans have none, and the elites that do are probably closely monitored (a solid example is the Vice documentary on NK. They take them to a computer lab to show them how they allow internet access now. Except with carefully viewing, as elaborated by the film crew in a voice over, it's painfully obvious none of these actors know how to utilize the internet. A classic scene is a man endlessly scrolling around the google search bar start page. Never typing any search in, just scrolling.)

However, they do have some black market access to foreign media, and despite the crackdown, it is lifting the veil off the eyes of many ordinary NK citizens. 

>Is there approval for their dictator?

Overwhelmingly among the common people (although probably much less so among elites). These people have lived their entire lives under a [cult of personality.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality). Certainly there are North Koreans who simply play along for safety reasons, but I have to fundamentally disagree with those in this thread who say many, or even most, are playing a long out of fear and know it is all bullshit. Even defectors who have gotten to a point where they were willing to risk their lives to reach SK still spoke about trying not to think about Kim Jong Un as they crossed, because they felt like they were betraying him and he could read their minds (source on this one is the Vice doc on NK refugees in SK).

240,TrueAskReddit,Does society require the poor/lower class in order to function correctly? Can there be those who are rich without there being people those who are dirt poor?,"Yes, but it will require an artificial workforce to replace the existing one. China actually seems on the right track to produce an automated artificial workforce, perhaps we'll see Google or IBM pick up the pieces for the west.

But upon acquiring an artificial workforce there is no reason why anything wouldn't be more than the cost of electricity to manufacture it, making everything essentially free. 

The hard bit will be the transition from our current workforce to that. As more and more citizens are replaced at their jobs by robots, the government will have to step in to handle the rapidly growing unemployed population.

241,TrueAskReddit,Is hypnotism real?,"In order to wholly answer your question, we need to draw the distinction between the term 'hypnotism' and the glamorized buzzword 'HYPNOTISM' (*with sparkles and sparks and mysterious awe*).

Hypnotism as seen on tv, in night clubs, and with your friends who say ""Hey, I can totally do hypnotism"", is mostly stylized and a big hype.  I'm not saying that the professional entertainers out there don't actually draw people into a suggestive state...I'm just saying that there tends to be a lot of crowd pleasing going on there.

Hypnosis from its clinical origin was all about putting the mind in a suggestive state in order to accomplish some goal **at the willingness of the patient**.  Those tv shows where someone who's hypnotized and the doctor ""forces"" them to relive a past traumatic memory? bullshit.  That's not how the art of mesmerizing is supposed to work.  For hypnosis to work, you need two things; 1) a willing participant, and 2) someone who's open to suggestion.  Short of strapping you to a chair and torturing you until I 'break your mind' in order to reprogram you, there isn't a whole lot to be gained from trying to hypnotize you if you think I'm full of crap.  

Hypnosis is used to induce a relaxed, 'suggestible' state.  It is then that the hypnotist can give his participant a suggestion (say, 'You're back at the point where you were brutally assaulted'...or 'your hand is as heavy as a concrete boulder'...or, to be silly, 'your teeth taste like rubber bands').  There is **no forcing someone to do something**.  If you ever saw a person bragging about how they ""made"" a person do something, then they're either misinformed or full of crap  -- either way, you should call them on it.  

**tl;dr - hypnosis *is* real, just maybe not in the way most people understand it**

EDIT - Check out *Powers of Hypnosis* by Jean Dauven.  Also, here's a neat little suggestive mind trick to try on your friends, you'll be surprised how many people get taken;

Ask your friend to spell a series of words as fast as they can.  When they agree, say ""As fast as you can, spell ROAST!"" (they spell roast), then ""Spell COAST!"" (they spell coast), then ""Spell BOAST!"" (they spell boast).  Then ask them ""What do you put in a toaster?"", to which most people will exclaim ""TOAST!"", then you smile and say ""no! you put bread in a toaster, silly!"".

That's a great party trick that really illustrates the idea of putting someones mind in a suggestive state, and then suggesting they feed you a funny answer.  Try it sometime :)"

246,TrueAskReddit,"Gravity on Mars is about 38% as strong as gravity on Earth. Will this cause any health problems for humans, should they reach Mars?",">Evolution of course will fix this issue over thousands of years but it seems as if the first few thousand generations born on Mars will experience some seriously stunted development of bones and muscles as a result of the profoundly weak Martian gravity not demanding nearly as much from them.

Uhhh... that's assuming we allow evolutionary pressures to take place. Your statement is predicated on the assumption that martians will completely throw away conventional morality, and that martian society will deliberately cull -- or at least allow to die through neglect -- those of inferior physical fitness. Which generally is the opposite of what we do on earth, what with billions being spent on curing illness and widespread medical care (where national finances allow).

**But back to the original question,** the effect of gravity. Now the effect of microgravity (which is different than low gravity) is well documented. Problems include skeletal degradation, severe loss of muscle mass, space adaptation sickness (confusion of the inner ear's mechanisms that normally give us a sense of balance), and malformation of the body due to the lack of gravity (eyeballs flatten to blur vision, liquids pressure tends to push liquids upwards due to the lack of gravity to counter-balance). No one is completely sure about how bad these effects may be on Mars, simply because we don't have any 0.4G habitats we can stick people in for months on end to watch.

But gravity is hardly the only problem.

On top of that, Mars' weak atmosphere means you're basically taking a consistently heavy dose of radiation -- or one would assume, given the limits of radiation shielding technology in the foreseeable future. So on top of the complications of low gravity are the complications of radiation exposure. There are some medicines and techniques for handling radiation exposure, but most of it is just acute doses. There's not much on prolonged human exposure to consistent, moderate levels of radiation over an entire lifespan.

And then there's the dust. So much, super-fine dust. Mars' dirt has been blasted again and again by impacts, turning it into an extremely fine powder that makes earth dust look like pebbles. Our technology, to say nothing of our bodies, are not well-designed to keep it out. So you'll have dust in your water, in your food, in your bloodsteam... the consequences of which are not entirely well documented. So there's that, too."
247,TrueAskReddit,What if Al Gore had won against Bush in the presidential election? Would the focus have shifted from terrorism to the environment?,"It's worth mentioning that fighting terrorism was *not* a primary focus of the Bush administration initially.  Bush was elected in January 2001, after campaigning on mostly domestic issues (reforming education, reforming social security and medicare, lowering taxes), and he went so far as to say (in a presidential debate that ""I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building"" (referring to Clinton's military activities in Somalia.  

Bush's 8 months in office before 9/11 were marked by the beginnings of an education overhaul (what would become No Child Left Behind), promotion of ""faith-based initiatives"", a tax-relief package, and putting together a new budget.  Combating terrorism was not a significant part of his agenda.  September 11 changed all that.

That's the reason why I don't know how things would be different now.  I think any president in office on that day *might* have conceivably had a radical shift in their priorities and policies.  I like to think that Gore would have handled the immediate crisis differently, used the opportunity to build bridges around the world rather than simply exert might, and would have retained his strong commitment to the environment ... but I'm just not sure."

One of the factors with diseases and how they spread is incubation period and how quickly it kills you. Apparently the Ebola virus doesn't spread very well because the mortality rate is so high (fewer survivors to carry it) and because death is swift.

It's not a *want*. It's a *need*. It comes before everything: food, water, a place to live, loved ones, safety. It's not because you don't care about these things. In your head you know things things are what makes you human. It's because this chemical produces a feeling inside of you that cannot be replicated by any other means. The feeling hijacks the motivation center of your brain, and the drug equals survival. Your instinct to survive is what drives you to do these terrible things. Your brain is screaming, your *entire being* is screaming for more, or else you will die (you won't, but you sure as hell think you will). In the face of death, real or perceived, a human will revert to an animalistic state. Fight or flight and all that. An addict, almost without question will *fight* for what they think they need.

It sort of dulls the highs and lows. Possibly because you've seen then before, or simply because the roller coaster isn't as fun the 1,000th time. When you hit 30 something shifts. Some it takes a bit after, but time heals all.

In the immediate: allow yourself to chase whatever happy means today. Don't judge yourself for this changing or growing or leaving. Be a leaf blowing in the wind.

Never allow other people's crazy to infect you. We allow social media, or TV, or coworkers, or our family impact our headspace. Start paying attention to who makes you feel bad or sad, and start to carve them out of your life. Removing the negative is a step to avoiding the bad.

And I want to say that you are wise. Happiness is a trap. It exists in fleeting pockets. Chasing it, or hoping to catch it in a jar is a waste of time. Because we'll be wondering why we can't have it each and every moment of the day. Hoping for complacency shows a cleverness beyond years.

253,TrueAskReddit,Does increasing minimum wage actually hurt small businesses?,"[Awesome podcast discussing this topic](http://thegoodfight.fm/episodes/20-minimum-wage-myths-busted)

Basically, the answer is NO. The podcast discusses several studies done in areas that are right next to each other geographically and similar demographically but across county or state lines which have different minimum wages. The areas with higher minimum wages do not see drops in employment and businesses didn't suffer when rates were changed.

The studies were a surprise to economists and there are several reasons that raising minimum wages doesn't hurt businesses as much as owners think it will. Some of the ones I remember include:
 
* All businesses' costs are going up together. If you have to raise prices, you won't lose business to other places because they'll be raising prices too. 

* If everyone in the area starts making more money, they'll have more to spend at your business.

* Paying employees more makes them work better and happier and lowers turnover."

Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. Yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don‘t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""

258,TrueAskReddit,What are some notable cultural differences between the United States and Canada?,"Canadian here. Well, we're more alike than we are different but here goes:
There's less of a gun culture here, keeping in mind the more rural you get the more pro-gun you get.  

We're not as nationalistic and more willing to see political dissent as part of 'making the country better' In this same vein we're less married to city/town/province pride. We tend to not identify ourselves by where we're from unlike, say, the 'East Philly represent' or 'New York is the greatest city in the world' type of statements. 

It's a thin population over a very large area so there's a perceived struggle over 'national identity'. This, I personally attribute to being so close to the Untied States where (from a Canadian perspective) the patriotism comes off as near bullying.  
  
A combination of less selection (in goods, services, pricing), isolation  and brutally cold winters gives us an air of British stoicism. ""Carry on, stiff upper lip"". This is where the 'polite Canadian' stereotype comes from. It's a near oxymoronic combination of empathy (yeah, we've all been there) and apathy (why stir up the shit by saying something mean? Who needs the hassle? I got my own shit to deal with)  
  
Which brings to mind a sort of 'mind your own business' mentality that is pervasive in Canadian society. We really don't want to chime in on your conversation, peak in your windows or spend too much time thinking about anyone else's opinion. We're not interested in trying to change anyone's mind and it would be ill-advised to try to change ours.  The plus side is a great degree of multiculturalism and tolerance and the downside is we occasionally down't give a shit when we should. 
  
Ok, here's the caveat: these are VERY broad generalizations and there are boatloads of people that will, rightly, disagree with them. There are examples left and right to prove and disprove all of the above. But that's my two cents. Oh, shit. We don't have pennies anymore. That's my..uh…two nickels."
259,TrueAskReddit,"Gentrification: If it's a problem for people with more money to move into places like Brooklyn, the Mission District in San Francisco and Oakland, where are they supposed to go?","I think the problem is the displacement of culture. I've lived in Brooklyn for about 15 years, and I can't think of a single person that thinks the growth and development is bad. But you do have a very different landscape.

When I got my first apartment it was in the heart of Bed stuy, 2br 1200/mo, half utilities included. Now the same place goes for 1900/mo zero utilities. The buyers/sellers are seeing even greater gains, houses you wouldn't have sold for 200k are easily going for 750k that need to be renovated. 750k, you need an income of about 150k for conventional financing... even in NYC jobs like that don't just pop up. When they do, you don't anticipate yourself living in Bed Stuy.

Now, there is something very appealing about living there; the architecture is amazing, the details in the house would cost a fortune to duplicate, and the pp/sqft is in the low 200's whereas a neighborhood like Brooklyn Heights (some parts of BK have always been nice) will run you 650-1000+ sq ft. Plus the taxes are much lower in these gentrifying enclaves. It's not about having too many people or not enough houses, it's about a certain type of person trying to replicate a certain lifestyle that isn't conventional. But papers have been written that show this isn't some sort of guerilla real estate market; people don't migrate to or from gentrifying neighborhoods faster than any other market. Certain types of people do though, those with ambition (fixer uppers) and a desire to stretch their dollars further.

Insofar as a moral obligation, I think your only obligation is to leave something better than when you first encountered it. Spike Lee rants about how nice the Fort Greene park is... cry me a river. Communities are always changing, Soho used to be a bunch of factories, then it was artists lofts, now it's financier coops, who knows maybe in 20 years it will be too expensive for them and go commercial again.

Money helps but it isn't the only thing, it just makes finding a place easier if you have more. 

Edit: Where are the old neighborhood people supposed to go? That's difficult to answer because it isn't a specific range of people. Some of them die, some go off to school, some find jobs elsewhere, a lot of things have to line up to make gentrification possible. I would go so far as to say that in a neighborhood that gentrifies there are probably far more winners than losers financially and culturally. There will be losers, but there are losers in any neighborhood, even when I lived in BK Heights people were getting evicted."
260,TrueAskReddit,Will America ever see a more-than 2-party system come into play? Is it worth it to vote 3rd party?,"The two party system is caused by our [first-past-the-post electoral process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo).  When the public demands a preferential voting system (like the [alternative vote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE) and [others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting_systems)) the media will start covering elections as if there are more than two parties.  Of course the two parties will always be against this as third, forth, fifth party viability dilutes their strength.   
   
EDIT: Because some people are asking ""But how?"" In the US adoption of this electoral process would happen state by state.  State legislatures can set their electoral process when electing Senators and Congressmen.  This is how it would likely start and then spread.  They could also implement electoral college rules where votes are divided proportionally among the candidates and in the event where a Presidential candidate doesn't have 50% support the candidate with the fewest electoral college votes gets eliminated and those votes are recalculated and allocated according to the rules of the Alternative Vote."

What people would he have to replace?,"People keep referencing what it takes to change the constitution, but seem to forget that our government (chiefly the Supreme Court, the Justice Department and congress) is in charge of interpreting, following and enforcing the constitution. Not a single letter of that document has any power if the people who are meant to follow it choose not to."
262,TrueAskReddit,Where is the line for when we should blame the person or biology when people do evil things?,"I feel bad for people in general. We're born into a body that is hardwired to survive, and many survival techniques are considered evil. If you're greedy, good job, you're trying to survive as biology dictates. Went around cheating on your partner or had sex with someone in a relationship? Again that's excellent, doing anything you can to reproduce. Are you a massive thrill seeker and often get into trouble in efforts to chase a rush? That sucks, because you probably have a dopamin e polymorphism and you will always be more susceptible to troublesome activities because of that. 

People may be ""evil"" for reasons not related to biology. For example, kids that have been abused by parents tend to bully other kids more. Sure the abused child is performing actions out of his own will, but how much of that is truly the result of critical thought, and how much is because of the way the child has been nurtured?

For the most part, I think society as a whole is to blame, not the people. Humans and animals in general are beings that exhibit behaviour based on their genetics and based on what they learn. I don't think it's possible to say that someone is the way they are because of... their own thinking I guess? It's tough to even put it in words. How else is a person supposed to form their own behaviour, when their brains are entirely shaped by genetics and environment? So that's why I say we should blame society. Only as a collective can we do a better job of raising people an environment that will foster ""good"" personalities, and for the portions that are controlled by genetics, we could put more into R&D to figure out how to manage that. 

Despite what I just said, if we want to enforce our morals (I mean, I don't want people to be able to punch me just because they've been abused as a child) then individuals still have to be held accountable. I've been screwed over badly by two different people that suffered from major depression. It was infuriating, but eventually I managed to forgive them due to their illness. They were always prone to making the wrong choices, even though the tried their best to make the right ones. Think about a time when you knew you had to do some homework, but you just couldn't get yourself off the xbox. Emotions and deep urges are super hard to control. However, this doesn't mean that playing Xbox is a good reason to get an extension. Just because I forgavy my former friends, doesn't I have to ever trust or associate with them again. I use this train of thought anytime someone makes the ""evil"" choice."

264,TrueAskReddit,What makes the Coronavirus Pandemic of now so different from the 2009 H1N1 flu?,"What an Italian Intensivist Doctor said was, in his 40 years of working, he has never seen another infectious disease like this. It just fills up infectious disease wards, then the ICU, then the whole hospital. This is because at least 10% of all infected need hospitalisation and about a third of those requiring ICU. Combined with its ridiculous infectivity, this allows it to completely overwhelm healthcare systems. When hospitals get full then the disease becomes a lot more lethal.

 In Italy they have completely run out of ventilators, without one, they die. They have to give them to people without pre-existing conditions and those who are younger because they have the best chance of survival. That means they are just leaving some people to die, because they just don't have the resources to save them. If Italy hadn't locked down it could have feasibly gotten 10x worse than that."

Fuck that.  You're putting the onus on them to ask for help, and to identify what they need.  Chances are, if someone is depressed, they don't actually know what will help.  

Come over to play Xbox.  Bring a pizza.  Take them out for a beer.  Take them to a strip club if that's their thing.  

The point is to *do something* without being asked or prompted.  

You'll see similar advice for how to help couples with a newborn.  Or for someone who just got out of the hospital.

268,TrueAskReddit,If everybody was fiscally responsible would the economy collapse?,"There will certainty be a deflation and it will hurt like hell. The ideal fiscally responsible actor would be saver and investor. The current economy has been stretched like a rubber band with high level of consumption. Without enough people keeping the force to hold this 'stretch' by spending (on non-essential stuff), this band will snap back in form of high unemployment, bankruptcies and pain all around. Dollar you spend is an income for another, and that income is what pays debt. If this cycle cannot sustain, the effect of deleveraging will freeze credit, which will cut research, jobs, and all that and more.

After long periods of adjustment we will emerge with new style of economics, one that does not depend on hyper spending. What will this look like? It's hard to say given that it's path dependant (from where we currently stand, downhill). But if history is of any indication, depression and shit. On the plus side, the environment will be doing super well.

Money has to flow, or economy freeze and dies. That's why it's called 'currency'. I'm not saying current system is good or bad. We just ended up here and it is what it is. Changing it now to fiscally responsible culture would create shock beyond what we can handle."
269,TrueAskReddit,What would society be like if Earth were the size of Jupiter?,"If other physics supernaturally remain the same (gravity, length of day, atmospheric pressure, local climates, etc.), then what remains to be answered is ""when"" this change occurred. A secondary question is whether vertical distances (mountain heights, etc.) are likewise multiplied.

If Earth had always had such incredible dimensions, life would not have evolved in the pattern it had. For instance, the dinosaur-killing impact event would have only been a small local catastrophe rather than global.

The surface area of such a modified Earth is about 122 times greater, and linear distances are about 11 times greater. The latter number is the most important. If this enlargement occurred shortly after our species appeared (roughly 200,000 years ago), we'd probably be stuck on Eurasia and Africa.

Reaching other continents would be practically impossible. Some exception neolithic voyages occurred, particularly from Asia to Australia, Hawaii, and Madagascar, but this was done with canoes and island-hopping, often on islands that have been submerged since the last ice age. If we multiplied such distances by 11, we'd probably have never spread out into the Pacific. Likewise, although North America was once connected to Asia with a land/ice bridge, the inhospitable climate would probably be insurmountable to primitive people over distances of ~1000 miles. 

Since every kind of geography has been enlarged, humans will spent most of their lives living in one kind of ecology. People who live in grasslands will consider oceans, mountains, and deserts to be mythological. 

With such great distances between differing environments, trade will be stifled. Instead of a caravan traveling for weeks or months, it would have to travel for years, which couldn't be done with primitive means shipping goods. For instance, the stones used to make the Great Pyramid would have had to travel about 6000 miles. 

This means that if a place is going to be technologically successful, it needs to have a *lot* of geographic diversity in a compact area (so that when enlarged it's not too far to trade). This might include some islands, for instance. 

The social development pattern of humans might look something like this: Humans evolve in savanna lands in Africa, then the Earth enlarges. Early people spread around freely in this environment, never encountering anything that requires technological adaptation (for centuries, perhaps). We're therefore extremely prepared for our existing environment, but everything outside of it is alien to us. Overcoming these changes takes time, but we eventually get around to it.

Crossing things like mountain ranges and modest-sized deserts is now impossible, so humans probably spread along coasts. Ocean climates tend to be moderate, so humans can easily survive the coastlines. The Mediterranean Sea, for instance, would have a coastline of almost 500,000 miles. Likewise, rivers and lakes are massive now. The Nile will be more than 20 miles wide, and Lake Victoria and the Great Lakes will be as vast as oceans. 

Humans will have to cling to rivers and oceans much more than we already do. Traveling inland can put you hundreds of miles from a reliable water source. Since environments are basically the same under the new scale (the village 300 miles up the river has the exact same climate as yours), there's not much point in trade, and therefore little communication or innovation.

The problem is that the current system is a series of traps implemented at nearly every conceivable level. Because [schools are funded by local property taxes](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/18/474256366/why-americas-schools-have-a-money-problem), schools in poorer neighborhoods are especially underfunded, maintaining that poverty trap, and neighborhoods with people of color, including majority black neighborhoods, are [statistically more likely to be lower-income](http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/reports/economic_mobility/pewsharkeyv12pdf.pdf). Poverty and lower quality education, on average, mean that there's not a level playing field from any standpoint, including economically. Poverty correlates both with [a higher likelihood of being a victim of crime](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5137) and [criminality](https://www.heartlandalliance.org/povertyreport/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2017/03/FINAL_PR17_3_14.pdf) (pdf link). And, as anyone paying attention knows, the criminal justice system [has undeniable issues of racial bias which benefit white Americans and damn Americans of color](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/18-examples-of-racism-in-criminal-legal-system_us_57f26bf0e4b095bd896a1476). The so-called war on drugs complicates the issue further, because that racism in the criminal justice system extends to [disproportionate arrest, trial, and sentencing of Americans of color for drug-related charges](https://www.aclu.org/issues/mass-incarceration/smart-justice/war-marijuana-black-and-white). [There are even systemic issues in healthcare](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/racism-discrimination-health-care-providers-patients-2017011611015), resulting in significantly different outcomes in medical care based on race. 

And this is just some of the big stuff. On a less obvious scale, we have issues with [systemic racism in hiring practices](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/9/18/16307782/study-racism-jobs), [racial segregation in religion](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/08/many-u-s-congregations-are-still-racially-segregated-but-things-are-changing-2/), [black Americans pay more for negotiable goods like cars](https://www.salon.com/2017/04/07/racism-in-america-its-so-pervasive-that-white-people-pay-less-for-car-insurance_partner/), and about a thousand other instances that fly under the radar for most white Americans because it's not part of our daily experience. 

Think about the scale of tackling this kind of systemic racism and discrimination across so many areas. The question as to what should be done means thinking about changing many, many fundamental aspects of American law, politics, culture, religion, education, healthcare, criminal justice/law enforcement, and individuals that it's difficult to fathom. 

So, to finally answer your question, there are a few things: 

1) **Refocus on education**. Education is the silver bullet in all of this because the old adage that knowledge is power has never been more true. I don't just mean having schools that prepare kids for college or that do well teaching math and science and art and history, but education in how the world really works. It's very easy to internalize the same lies that white Americans internalize, that black people are somehow inherently less-than, that black people are inherently more criminal, that black people are somehow responsible for being second-class citizens. That's not borne out by our best understandings of race. Race is purely a social construct, and as we understand it now only dates back about 600 years. It's made-up. There are no significant differences, innately, between black and white people. The only differences which matter are enforced through culture, and culture can and does change. That understanding is a powerful defense against cultural myths about race that people, regardless of race, can internalize without even knowing it. Focusing on the historical and modern efforts of black activists and leaders, on the very long and hard-fought battle for equality that stretches back to the early European colonization of Africa, and teaching kids about the difficulties they will face within the racist systems is a good start. 

The problem? Like I said, schools are underfunded in general, but that's especially true in lower-income neighborhoods. Teachers are responsible for overcrowded classrooms, shrinking budgets for vital materials, dealing with children's behavior which is linked to poverty, and parents are needing to work more hours because their average hourly take-home is lower, meaning less time to be with kids and be part of the educational team. 

2) **Vote, vote, vote.** The one thing most Americans have in common now that it's legal for women, people who don't own property, and people of color can vote is being part of the democratic process. Fir the first time I'm aware of, in 2012 [a larger percentage of the black American population of eligible voters voted in the election than white Americans, greater than 65%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/). Unfortunately, that dropped down to 59% in 2016, which I'll get to in a second. Voting is power, the power to bring about change, the power to hold people responsible, the power to overthrow the government every 2-4 years. While it is absolutely not the case that black voter turnout is responsible for the 2010 midterms or the 2016 presidential election result, it is the case that higher black voter turnout could have meant that key races went to candidates who's stated policies could have been beneficial to black Americans. Imagine if black voter turnout was above 90%, especially in key battleground states. And this is even more true for state and local elections, in which a single vote counts far more than on the national level. 

The problem? Voter suppression has made a terrifying comeback. A solution ostensibly in search of a problem, voter ID and voter purge laws and policies are making it more and more difficult for people to vote, and the efforts are clearly and undeniably aimed at the poor and at people of color. In 2016, Wisconsin—historically a state with very high voter turnout—[saw turnout return to levels not seen in nearly 2 decades because of a voter ID law](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/voter-suppression-wisconsin-election-2016/). While turnout only fell slightly in white, middle-class areas, it dropped significantly in districts which had larger populations of black voters. Make absolutely no mistake: American democracy is under attack, and those attacks are aimed squarely at low-income Americans and Americans of color. 

I could go on, about insisting on cultural changes in law enforcement brought about by increasing numbers of black and Latino police pushing back against racist policies, about doing the same with nursing, about pushing for a better network of legal options to fight back against racist hiring practices, but in the end I'm always going to have a ""The problem?"" paragraph explaining why these things aren't feasible. 

To put this bluntly, I take issue with the question. This isn't something black Americans can or should fix alone. Speaking as a white American, we're a fucking huge part of the problem. And I don't mean the minority of white Americans who are openly and unapologetically racist. Yes, they're shitheads and bring shame on themselves and everyone around them. No, the biggest problem is white moderates. I'll let Dr. King explain: 

>First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;"" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season.""

>Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.""

- Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. - *Letter from Birmingham Jail*, April 16, 1963

As a white person, I can comfortably ignore everything I wrote above, in fact I'm quite certain there are vast areas of systemic racism of which I'm completely unaware. The experience of racism against black Americans is outside of my experience entirely, which means I have to not just listen when people in my environment speak to these issues but actively have to go searching for information on this. That takes considerable effort, and frankly it's an effort few if any make, even those who consider themselves advocates for civil rights and racial equality.

272,TrueAskReddit,"Why does Communism/Radical Socialism have intellectual backgrounds, yet far-right movements do not?","Disclaimer: it has been years since I've looked into the academic side of fascism, so a lot of this is vague

I don't think it's far to say fascism doesn't have roots in political philosophers. Hegel comes immediately to mind, and many leftist philosophers are also ideologically very important in the development of fascism (ex: Sorel), making it difficult to separate their academic histories. Mussolini himself was a socialist originally. And that's not even considering that at least some fascist ideas can trace back to the classical era.

But it's also important to note that action is *integral* to fascism, that inaction is a cardinal sin to the ideology. While its brand of anti-intellectualism doesn't explicitly shun academia and there are plenty of fascists who have done a lot of writing (Mussolini was a big writer, and Strasser comes to mind), in practice it is at least a secondary focus. You see strong calls to action on the left too (ex: insurrectionary anarchism), but overall, fascism is the ideology of action, so it will necessarily be more lacking in philosophers, whereas socialism is more amenable to theorizing.

And, of course, Fascism was very young when the forties discredited it. Certainly it's not entirely gone, and there have been plenty that some people would say discredits socialism as well, but socialism arose during the Enlightment and even communism has half a century on fascism. Perhaps if it had had more history and weight, fascism would have wholly survived the world wars, but it didn't, so it was successfully discredited in a way that a group of ideologies with as much history as the various socialisms could not be."
273,TrueAskReddit,Why do climate change deniers tend to lean right?,"Since environmentalism is generally a cause of the left (at least in the US), those on the right are predisposed to distrust environmental arguments. 

Before climate change was recognized as a big problem, there was already a strong push for pollution regulations on the left, and a strong pushback from the right. The battle lines were drawn in the 60s/70s, over things like strip mining and pesticides, which are much less clear-cut than climate change. 

Many people on the right do not look at global warming by itself, they look at it as part of a long string of environmental justifications for regulation the left has offered over the last several decades."
274,TrueAskReddit,"Could we reach a point in the future where we know so much in a field, that no single person could even study all the necessary material to contribute meaningfully to current efforts in a field?","Coming from someone in the sciences, I think we already have.

Fast, widespread communication across disciplines is the only way to make lasting progress in a field, and I do think we are shifting towards that paradigm."
275,TrueAskReddit,"Realistically, is solar energy technology at a point today that it is capable of becoming the primary energy source for the world? Why or why not?","No.

The real problem is energy storage. Power grids for the most part, actually generate power on demand. There aren't massive batteries anywhere that hold power to be used later, they actually have to produce more power as the demand increases.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slDAvewWfrA

In the UK they even have time the power grid with popular programs, because afterwards people all put the kettle on for a cup of tea. This is one of the reasons that fossil fuel power is so useful, because you can just dial up the amount of power they generate. 

Here you can see the percentage of power generated in the UK by type.

http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/

Additionally, if by accident, the grid produces *too much* electricity, they have to bleed it off somewhere, this is not a good thing either.

So obviously the problem with solar, is that even if there were enough solar panels to power the country, it would only work in the day, and be inconsistent at best as the weather causes different output levels.

There is technology to store power (hell, you could just have a massive pump and reservoir of water that you pump to a higher elevation and then retrieve the power by running it over a turbine later on), but it's not terribly efficient. So I guess hypothetically, the technology exists to allow this, but it's not super feasible. Kinda like saying that hypothetically we have the technology to allow a person to walk across the united states if they wanted too.

The real blocker is the infrastructure, and having efficient enough technology for it to be worthwhile."
276,TrueAskReddit,Are people getting weirder and more hateful or is the availability of instant (anonymous or not) commenting just providing the stage for it?,"I suspect you'll get a lot of responses pointing out that anonymity removes the consequences of expressing politically incorrect opinions or being hateful/spiteful and argumentative. That's right, but that's not how I look at it, because I think this is actually a good thing.

A lot of people go their entire lives harboring opinions they know are deviant or hugely unpopular. They really do have aggressive, hateful, disrespectful thoughts and opinions, but because there would be potentially severe consequences to expressing them, they don't. As a result, those opinions and feelings are never challenged. The person never has the chance to grow beyond them because they never process them.

As ugly as the process is, a person saying something unpopular on the Internet, I believe, could actually make them a better person. Of course, this requires that someone actually challenge those unpopular ideas, preferably with facts. If a forum degrades so completely into vitriol and ignorance that no one does that anymore, it just becomes an echo-chamber for ignorance.

If we want to live in a free society (with, at least, free speech), this is one of the prices we must pay. We can't (or, at least, we usually shouldn't) just keep people from speaking, no matter how objectionable their words. I think we need to patiently and sometimes repeatedly rebut ignorance with truth. To editorialize a tad, I'm much more scared of the world that might unwittingly be created by empowering a mechanism to silence those voices than I am of the voices themselves. "
277,TrueAskReddit,Why is there a belief in society that one cannot be successful while taking recreational drugs?,"I guess for one its because those, who have their lives fall apart, cant hide their drug use as good as others. From my own experience, rich people use drugs just as much as everyone else. People in shitty conditions probably use drugs as a coping mechanism rather than socially, so it creates more habitual use and addiction and much of the issues associated with drugs.       

It can be also due to all in one bucket term of drugs. Some drugs can enhance your productivity, while some do not. Some drugs harm your physical health, some do not. Some drugs harm your mental health, some do not. Some drugs are highly addictive, some are not. And so on. We are influenced by this IV heroin addict stereotype of drugs, which is a representation of only a small and extreme portion of drug users.          

It can also be because of poor education on drugs. There are drugs that can be somewhat harmless when done right, yet highly enjoyable and beneficial at the same time; while taken wrongly can fuck you up. As such, drugs that some claim to be safe, appear to be dangerous, because someone was a moron and fucked up, and to a person who knows nothing about drugs, is enough to in validate any claims of the drug being relatively safe. And the reaction is completely understandable, after all to many this is a taboo topic, and people are cautious with unknown.             

That being said, I do not try to downplay the harm drugs can do, if you wish to experiment, research and then some more, prior taking any substance. I can definitely say that if your friend has taken a drug and seems to be fine, is not a good indicator if a drug is harmless. Some people are more prone to addiction of a certain drug while others to another.

* Colleges would fleece the next round of 18 year old freshman with sky high tuition costs. 

* In 1998, the average public university's in state tuition = $3,168, out of state public = $8,840 , private = $16,233

* In 2019, the average public university's in state tuition  = $10,858, out of state public = $26,528,  private = $43,562

* Since 1998 inflation has only increased 51%. 

*I suppose the cost of teaching math, biology and history has gotten very expensive in over the past 20 years.* 

*You'd think it be much easier to educate students in 2019, than it was when people were still using Excite.com for internet search. They call this the Information Age.*

Even if all of the debt is forgiven and the government starts paying for everyone's tuition, universities will still be charging 18 year olds sky high tuition, just now they'll be gouging the entire country for the money.  

Meanwhile university endowments grow fat with wealth and they buy up more and more local real estate with your sweet loan money.  Harvard's endowment is currently up to $36 billion, The University of Texas system is at $26.5 billion.  

I've yet to hear one politician point out that the greediest actors in this story are the universities themselves. 

Yes, loan originators are benefitting from fleecing our youth as well, but the universities got all your cash up front. They got it at 40K per student per year, or whatever they felt like charging you because only they can give the credentials that we need to get jobs.     

The Universities have all this money, right now and none of them would even think to mention lowering tuition. 

Even the very liberal Bernie Sander, who appears to have good intentions, makes no mention of lowering tuition or even making some attempt at getting public universities to justify their current tuition rates.  

All his plan mentions is preventing future tuition rate increases by certain amounts.

His plan calls for ""eliminating"" tuition and fees at public institutions, by essentially using federal money to cover the cost of tuition and fees. 

You would think in the very least that there would be some effort made to ensure that tuition rates actually reflected the actual costs of educating college students. 

No, apparently the current rates for tuition, housing, fees and a $200 Bio 101 are all perfectly reasonable just as long as they don't increase too much in the coming years. 

Every debt elimination and tuition plan I've heard of will continue to allow Universities and the related industries to make higher education as expensive as they can get away with. 

The darkest part is, how much all of this completely misses the point of simply *making the best effort we can to educate people in a way that will hopefully allow them to pursue a genuine interest or attempt to make a positive contribution to the world and ideally be able to comfortably support themselves while doing so.* 

The utter lack of new ideas, attention to detail or just any voice that doesn't parrot the same low-effort bullshit short term fix is fucking depressing.  

If libraries didn't already exist, I'm sure some  tech startup would try to turn them into some kind of subscription based ""experience"" , complete with an entry fee on special days like weekends.  Of course there would be an accompanying book sharing that you'd have to sign up for as well so that they could suck up as much data as possible while you're simply trying to learn something.   

The founder would tell us how this new service hopes to educate the world through sharing and community for only $9.99 a month (for the basic subscription)

Of course the subscription would tier based too. If you want ad-free books or to access even more ""content"", sign up for library ""Prime"" for $5 a month more.  

Here you'll find an even bigger ""library"" of material and special ""extended"" books that are actually just the original books that having been shortened for the non-prime peasants. 

Wait, there's more.  Have you ever wanted to access your books not only in your bedroom but other places as well ?  Well we got you've covered, Platinum Prime users can turn off geofencing for their 3 favorite locations !

280,TrueAskReddit,Why do cars have top speeds of 200 kmph and above when the maximum speed limit allowed anywhere in the world is only 140 kmph?,"Essentially, you build engines with extra capacity, ~60 kmph, so that at the maximum legal speed the engines are not outputting 100% capacity which would introduce more strain on the engine and decrease its lifespan.

282,TrueAskReddit,"What could present day humanity actually do to fight off an alien invasion similar to ""Independence Day""?","Realistically speaking? 

Nothing. We're screwed.

For us to stand a chance, the aliens in question would have to be a strange mix of *smart* enough to be capable of interstellar travel and creating city-sized ships and yet *dumb* enough that they're incapable of figuring out concepts like ""a fast enough rock is a deadly weapon"".

Because the reality of the situation is, if there's even the *tiniest* chance that we're a credible threat, they'll just sterilize the surface of Earth - and doing so would be absolutely trivial for aliens capable of interstellar travel.

Just take the nearest asteroid or other large chunk of rock, accelerate it to an appreciable fraction of the speed of light and aim at Earth. Game over."
283,TrueAskReddit,"What is scarier, a finite or infinite universe?","An infinite universe certainty heightens the possibility of [Boltzmann brains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain), [false vacuum nucleation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum), and other probabilistic oddities that we would likely not be be able to observe or foresee in our timescale. 

Humans are used to having things in an orderly fashion (we *know* the Earth is round, and before that we preferred to know that the Earth was flat, but never *unknown*). The thought of a universe with no tangible ending, well beyond our observable sphere, certainty means there may be phenomenon out there we can ever physically observe or simulate, regardless of our technological advancement. 


I think the fear I have of a truly infinite, unobservable universe is derived from the same fear I have of death, dense fogs, and sitting in the middle seats on airplanes. The thought of relinquishing control of my life to systems beyond my comprehension is unsettling."
284,TrueAskReddit,University essays often ask students to write about their greatest struggle and how they overcame it; what can someone write who has had a fairly sheltered life?,"There must be many other young people in the same boat as you. Think about what universities are really looking for when they ask such questions. In this case, perhaps they want to see how you take initiative to solve a problem and how you react in the face of setbacks. If you dig deep enough you should be able to find a struggle to write about, even if it's just the struggle of deciding what to do with your future given the opportunities and resources available to you. Maybe talk about the soul-searching and researching that goes into that.

I don't think admissions people expect every prospective student fresh out of high school to be a super-philanthrophic-wunderkind, but they want to see the potential and aspiration to be someone who achieves something for whatever cause is dear to them."
285,TrueAskReddit,Is selflessness a great virtue? Or is selflessness a needless sacrifice of the individual?,"I would say it depends on the context of who's doing the selfless thing, their background, and the context of the situation.

There can be times where selflessness is a virtue, but there are also many times that selflessness is born out of the lack of self-respect, or being a pushover. And that is not a virtue (it isn't a vice either, but it makes you feel sorry for the pushover person)."
286,TrueAskReddit,"Should there be an option for ""no confidence"" on election ballots?","The obvious alternative to this would be to vote for the candidate you think is best suited to making your voice heard.

A story to tell.

In 1984 (yeah, I'm old)  I was living with the parents in a rather stuffy and conservative section of suburbia.  Faced with the prospect of voting for either Reagan or Mondale, neither of whom I considered an effective candidate, I decided, in the voting booth, to pick a minor-party candidate.  When the voting results were published the next day, my district had thousands of votes for Republicans, and *one* vote for the Black Panther Party.  Fun times.

Americans, IMHO, need to get over their obsession with 'picking a winner' and start voting their beliefs and their consciences.  The two-party system works only if people continue to think that casting a 'protest vote' or voting for a candidate who is not predicted to have a chance to win is 'throwing your vote away.'

287,TrueAskReddit,Are modern companies more obsessed with profit than companies from 50 years ago or does it just feel that way?,"The thing that has changed is many cases is that people are expecting to make a profit faster.

288,TrueAskReddit,"If polar bears are losing their habitat in the Arctic region, why can't they be bred in Antarctica, where there is much more stable landmass?","Ecologist here.

A common misconception among many people is that the Arctic and the Antarctic are very similar places because they are both regions around poles and are cold with lots of ice. Although those things are true, the two poles could not be more different; the Arctic is basically a frozen(ish) ocean surrounded by land, whereas the Antarctic is land surrounded by a frozen ocean. While that sounds like no big deal, it actually makes a huge difference in the livability of each area.   
Because of its continental nature, the Antarctic is much, MUCH colder than the Arctic, with average temperatures of -60C and 0C, respectively. This is HUGE in terms of polar bear survival - even though they have lots of fat and insulating fur, there is a limit to how much that will protect them. The mammals of the Antarctic are all marine mammals (porpoises, seals, whales) because there are no large land mammals that can survive that level of cold. 

'Adapting to a different type of prey' sounds easy to us humans because we can logically evaluate different things to see if they may be good to eat. Animals do not do this. Top predators have what's called a 'search image' when they look for prey - they know exactly the animals they can eat, and search only for those animals. Polar bears survive mainly on ringed seals and bearded seals. Both of these prey items live only in the Arctic. A polar bear in the Antarctic would look at an Antarctic Fur Seal and think 'That doesn't look like what I usually eat. I cannot eat that'. The bears would likely starve, or become extremely hungry and weak before going after something else, and by that point (especially in the harsh Antarctic) they would likely not survive.

It's also important to note the extreme fragility of the Antarctic ecosystem. Because it is such a harsh and severe area, everything that lives and/or breeds on the continent (7 species of seal, 4 species of penguin and several bird species) has adapted to just barely beat the odds on survival. Even just the accidental introduction of the common rat has absolutely devastated populations of albatross, petral, and other bird species because of predation on eggs. 

Basically, there isn't a single good thing about introducing polar bears anywhere except the Arctic. Animals have adapted to certain places on the planet for a reason, and if they haven't appeared or evolved somewhere, there is likely a very good reason for it and we humans have no business fucking with something nature has spent millions of years perfecting.

tl;dr  Different places on the planet are different.


Edit: I reread your question, and felt I should add that 'the arctic' isn't literally ice and water, and even if it was, polar bears don't JUST live in the arctic circle. [Here's](http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/islands_oceans_poles/arcticregion.jpg) a photo of the Arctic region and [here](http://www.discoveringthearctic.org.uk/images/4d_img_beargraph.gif) is where polar bears live"
289,TrueAskReddit,How would society be different if emotions were clearly visible?,"I see several people in this discussion interpreting the results as if the change were to be overnight to all people without the benefit of society developing around the physical trait.  If I woke up tomorrow and was suddenly unable to hide my emotions from anyone, and they from me, then I suspect that society as we know it might collapse.  However, if we assume a hypothetical universe in which society developed around human-like-creatures which were constantly advertising their emotions we would probably rely on it to function.  Currently having all emotions visible would feel almost like a violation; but, in a society where unavoidable emotional expression was the norm, it would probably feel odd to not always know how those around you felt.

If we assume the ""appears overnight"" component then I imagine that makeup would become very popular for several generations until we adapt to the new norm.

We're also ignoring that we already simulate emotional and physical responses with makeup and styling, so maybe it wouldn't be as far a jump as it initially seems."

296,TrueAskReddit,Why is there not much political music right now?,"Remember that the political music of any era becomes more important and noticeable once the era is history. 

If a TV channel has a history documentary about an era, they'll focus on the music that most reflects the times, rather than the music that was the most straightforwardly popular. The music that reflects the times is often political, because the most popular music of a time is instead usually about the perennial topics - falling in love, breaking up, sex, dancing, etc.

Take 'All Along The Watchtower' by Jimi Hendrix, for example. This is one of the iconic Vietnam era songs - you hear the strains of it on TV and it's a cue that you're probably going to see footage of Vietnam and Woodstock and Nixon etc. However, 'All Along The Watchtower' was Hendrix's only top 20 single in the USA, and it only reached #20. 

In contrast, there's plenty of entirely forgotten songs that flew higher in the charts circa late 1968, when 'All Along The Watchtower' was released as a single. The last chart of 1968 features songs like Bobby Vinton's 'I Love How You Love Me', the Supremes' 'I'm Gonna Make You Love Me', Classics IV's 'Stormy' and Johnnie Taylor's 'Who's Making Love', which are all songs you typically *don't* hear in Vietnam era documentaries. 

In 30-40 years, Kendrick Lamar's 'Alright' (a fairly political song, judging by it being chanted at #blacklivesmatter marches and all) will be remembered much more clearly than Drake's 'One Dance', even though Drake's topped the charts with that song and Kendrick Lamar reached an amazing #81 in the charts."

I’ve never found it personally difficult to learn a new topic in depth—I’ll spend hours researching before buying a new toaster. Not just reading reviews and such but going and looking up what parts each one uses and what effect one part has over another. I won’t put in effort to learn something at a high level I perceive as having no immediate value but that’s actually relatively few things. If I had infinite time, I would be studying everything from car mechanics to astrophysics.

I have some speculations as to what about my upbringing wired me that way and my husband also struggles with ADHD so I’m well aware it’s not something everyone finds easy.

303,TrueAskReddit,What cultural factors make the US far less likely to have effective protests compared to other recent examples like France or Belgium?,"It's less a matter of culture and more a matter of geography, I would say.

If France wants to stage a protest in their capitol, about as far away as you can get while still living in a major city is ~370 miles.

If America wants to stage a protest in its capitol.. well, you're pretty much only looking at relatively local people for attendance. Nobody is going to come in from the west coast as it is well over 2,000 miles away.

Couple these factors with a vastly superior transit system in France and you can see how much easier it is to reach a protest in France than it is in the US.

304,TrueAskReddit,Why do owners of companies need enormous profits to work hard when salaried professionals in public and private sector give their best to do the job efficiently and even succeed in bringing good results?,">salaried professionals in public and private sector give their best to do the job efficiently

Not even close to accurate IMO.  I think salaried professionals would likely do a much better job in most cases if their income was tied more directly to their results.

Of course, in politicians' case, they are incentivized by the desire to get re-elected.

>What if we switch to a system under which every individual earns a fixed monthly salary and the capital to start business is obtained from a government that is kept accountable to people by means of modern technology?

I would never, ever, ever consider starting a business in that system, and most people indeed would not.  ""Hey, would you like to work your tail off for multiple years and, if successful, receive no particular reward?""  Some people might still start businesses, but far fewer than under the current system.

>want to make this world a fair place.

The world would be fairer if everybody had the same living standard as the current world's poorest person.  But it would not be better.

A system of rewarding people who do things that society finds valuable with financial incentives has been in place for the last couple hundred years, and the result has been a larger increase in global median living conditions than was witnessed over the prior couple hundred thousand years.  Fairness is not good enough as a standalone value.  We also need to value total well-being, and recognize that some economic activities really do create value, and generate a win-win scenario for society, rather than merely growing somebody's slice of the pie at the cost of another's."

307,TrueAskReddit,Why do patents only last 14 years while copyrights lasts at least 70 years?,">The original length of copyright in the United States was 14 years, and it had to be explicitly applied for. If the author wished, they could apply for a second 14‑year monopoly grant, but after that the work entered the public domain, so it could be used and built upon by others.

vs

>The original patent term under the 1790 Patent Act was decided individually for each patent, but ""not exceeding fourteen years"" 

>[Present day] In the United States, for utility patents filed on or after June 8, 1995, the term of the patent is 20 years from the earliest filing date of the application on which the patent was granted

So once upon a time... not so dissimilar. So the real question is why copyright has increased in length by 42 years *plus* the remaining lifetime of the author after they write the thing, while patent terms have only increased by 6 years or so.

Maybe it's Disney lobbying *hard* to keep Mickey Mouse under copyright, that's certainly a factor in the growth of copyright protection. But there are also companies that would have profited plentifully from their patents if allowed to do so, so apparently their lobbying efforts failed.

I'm guessing *that's* because inventions remaining under exclusive control of their inventor places a much more direct and obvious stranglehold on further innovation, whereas copyright only strangles the (generally considered) less important sphere of derivative cultural works; when patents are over-extended it creates a more obvious detrimental effect on the world for people to rail against."

312,TrueAskReddit,"Is it possible our discussions have become too dependant on empirical evidence, and as a result we're ignoring ( or under weighting) important factors that are difficult to measure?","From my perspective as a grad student in a STEM field, I think there are two main problems that relate to what you are saying. 

First, there's the is-ought problem.  Empirical science is good for telling you how to achieve a certain goal, but it's not good for telling you which ultimate goals you should be aiming for.  It can tell you how the world is, but not how it _ought_ to be.  However, sometimes misinterpret science to try and do this...the most egregious example being the social Darwinism of the early 1900's.  It also shows up today with health food and the idea that ""X is natural, therefore X is good""

The second issue is that scientific findings _always_ get hugely blown out of proportion as they migrate from the actual papers to the public conciousness.  Someone finds that one species of animal does one thing, and suddenly ""X _is_ Y for the whole living world"".  Or a test of an experimental drug is successful and suddenly ""Cure for X is found!"".   So making decisions based on the popular understanding of science, as opposed to _actual_ science, is not very profitable.

Evidently they were wrong and it really is not a big leap to say that it could happen again. How far in the future does it have to be when you have such a force like NATO in the world? I guess we'll have to see, but when it does come and you have some first world governments up against a wall, they will probably not hesitate to use nuclear weapons in order to keep their place. "
314,TrueAskReddit,"Should we judge the actions of people in other cultures (present and past) by their ethical standards or our own? If we judge by their standards, what must we think of people who follow our mores but break those of their own society?","Good, Evil, Moral, etc.. are all, as you put it, subjective. You can look at it from so many different angles, that you it is hard to find a constant.

In my opinion, we can only judge someone, in any time period, by the closest thing to a constant we can get: What they themselves think is moral at the time of the act, by the knowledge and information that they had at that time.

For example:

* A man murders a child. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man did not know. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man knows that the child was a serial killer. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man knows that the child is a serial killer. The man was wrong, and the child did not kill the people he believed him to. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man knows that the child is a serial killer. The man was wrong, and the child did not kill the people he believed him to. The child did kill other people, and thus is a serial killer. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man knows that the child is a serial killer. The man was wrong, and the child did not kill the people he believed him to. The child did kill other people, and thus is a serial killer. The people that the child killed were terrorists. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man knows that the child is a serial killer. The man was wrong, and the child did not kill the people he believed him to. The child did kill other people, and thus is a serial killer. The people that the child killed were terrorists. The child did not know they were terrorists. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man knows that the child is a serial killer. The man was wrong, and the child did not kill the people he believed him to. The child did kill other people, and thus is a serial killer. The people that the child killed were terrorists. The child did not know they were terrorists. The man did know that they were terrorists. Was the man evil?

And so on. Every time we elaborate, or change what each party might know, we get different answers. The only thing we can judge, truthfully, was based on what the man believed, and why he did it.

To put it on another plane, you can think of it in the same light you would judge a sports trade.

The A's make a trade with the Nationals, in which the A's trade a Starting Pitcher for a few prospects.

Three years later, we find that the pitcher got injured right after being traded, and the prospects turned into average players.

Do we judge this trade as a win for the A's? A failure for the Nationals? But no one could predict the Starting Pitcher getting injured. And Prospects have such a high rate of failure, that they are a gamble.

What if the Pitcher stayed healthy the entire year, won the Cy Young and took the Nationals to the world series? All of a sudden, our view now is that the trade was a huge win for the Nationals. But all it took was a freak injury to change everything.

* Now we learn that that trade was Gio Gonzales for Tommy Milone, Brad Peacock, AJ Cole and Derek Norris. Does adding names bias our judgement now?
* What if that trade is now Tim Hudson for Dan Meyer, Juan Cruz and Charles Thomas?
* What if the trade was Mark Mulder for Dan Haren, Kiko Calero, and Daric Barton?
* What if the trade was Trevor Cahill for Jarrod Parker, Ryan Cook, and Collin Cowgill?
* What if that trade was Dan Haren for Carlos Gonzalez, Brett Anderson, Chris Carter, Aaron Cunningham, Dana Eveland, and Greg Smith?
* What if that trade was Brett Anderson for Chris Jensen and Drew Pomeranz?
* What if that trade was NOT trading Barry Zito?

So many trades that are much the same thing over and over, but with different results.

Can we judge looking back? No. The only way we can judge the trade is by the evidence, thought process and motivations by either party at the time of the trade, not anything that happens after the trade, unless it was something that they explicitly knew about.

We have to ask, If I had the same information as they did then, and only that, would I have made that trade in the same situation? Even then, to avoid Bias, you would need to judge it in a sense not by the specific players, but by the type of players that were involved (Starting Pitcher for 3 Grade B Prospects, 1 Grade C Prospect).

So to answer your question, I think you must judge that person by what they believe they are doing, not what you believe they are doing."
315,TrueAskReddit,Why is it that humans see themselves as seperated from nature?,"Sentience. We are aware of who we are, where we came from, where we're going, and the larger implications of our actions. 

Mastery. We alone hold the power to destroy nature, or to help her along. We could nuke the planet today, if we so choose. It puts us on a higher level. If you have control over something, you don't really feel that you are simply part of it. 

Disconnect. We build things that take us away from nature. The process adds steps and makes it seem alien. Living in a large city, you can completely avoid seeing trees etc and instead be surrounded by man made structures.

PC's were virtually no existent in my formal education. But they were introduced into my work life almost from the outset. As the ""young one,"" way back when, the older generations and older baby boomers put it on me to ""figure out the computers.""

I was basically self taught which gives you a certain level of confidence. By the same token, my understanding and methods are full of inelegant solutions and work arounds.

You want to end mass violence?  


Refund schools and education. Institute better healthcare, protect the poor and give them resources, give support to those who need it on a governmental and societal level, encourage saftey and the ability to talk about social issues such as racism and abuse and the power to reform these things.  


So long as we have systems in place designed for exploitation the exploited are going to lash out - whether the people they lash out against are regular people like them (the wrong people) or the people who exploit them.

319,TrueAskReddit,What is the problem with our recycling system? Why can’t we switch to compostable baggies totally?,"It's not the recycling system, it's the bags.

""Compostable bags"" are  not always great for packaging. They (by design) break down when damp, don't stand up to freezing very well, aren't as gas-tight (so no vacuum/protective atmosphere), aren't always food-safe, and they aren't as strong as regular plastic. You can't shrink-wrap biodegradable bags and they're less elastic.

So, there are quite a few downsides. Most of those downsides CAN be solved, and most aren't even THAT hard, but it does require significant investment from producers, for very little financial gain, and probably even increased cost per unit.

So, we totally CAN switch, but it costs money."

321,TrueAskReddit,What would happen if United States suddenly paid off its foreign debt?,"The actual answer is: it depends on what you mean by pay off. 

I've been a couple decades in finance, so this is the takeaway from all that time. Because of the system of currency we use, in which we have a fiat currency with floating rate convertibility, the United States as a currency issuing authority can issue net financial assets at will. It is useful to stop thinking about government obligations in terms of debt and cash as though the government needed to borrow to have cash to spend - it doesn't. It can create assets, cash or bonds, by fiat and issue them into the private sector in exchange for whatever is priced in dollars. There's very little difference between cash (a non-interest bearing asset) and bonds (an interest bearing asset) when interest rates are very low. 

When we talk about the United States paying off its debt, we could mean one of two things. First, we could mean swapping all the outstanding bonds for cash - that is, swap one asset in the private sector for another. (It is important to realize that the government's liabilities are the private sector's net financial assets.) The net effect is to reduce ongiong deficits be eliminating the need to create financial assets to pay interest into the private sector, but that would likely have a recessionary effect as it reduces interest payment cash flows to the private sector. But the net effect would not be the end of the world. Instead of the banking system sitting on piles of bonds on its asset side, it would sit on piles of cash notes.

The second, more impactful possibility would be the attempt to run persistent surpluses in government. This is not just a swap but rather a draining of net financial assets from the private sector - again, government liabilities are net private assets. This amounts to compelling the private sector to run a deficit that offsets the public surplus - and that means depression, contraction, deleveraging, the engagement of what Irving Fisher called debt-deflation. That is of course exceedingly unwise. "

323,TrueAskReddit,"Just went through an airport security checkpoint. Why do detractors label it ""security theater"", and why is US airport security policy inherently flawed?","There are multiple reasons that airport screening is security theater: 

 - The TSA screens out ""dangerous"" items that can then be purchased on the other side of the security line, inside the airport.
 - The TSA regularly fails its own tests, with tiger teams trying to smuggle in items.  Off the top of my head, I think they have a 60-70% pass rate.  Some brave reporters have also had similar results.
 - A lot of the time-consuming demands -- photo ID, exact match of name to ticket, not saying trigger words like ""bomb"" at the security gate -- offer zero additional security.  The least able bomber would be able to pass these tests, and they _really_ inconvenience the Bob/Robert mismatches they do catch.  These hurdles are only there to convince people that the authorities are totally on top of it.
 - Studies show that looking for extremely rare items -- like a gun -- is difficult for humans to find, in hour after hour of common items.  Will they get that water bottle in your backpack?  Hell yes.  Will they spot the knife?  Probably.  Will they spot the gun or the explosive?  No, not often.
 - Prior to the 9/11 hijackings, passengers were passive.  A hijacking was best survived by laying low, waiting for the plane to go somewhere and have the hijacker's demands met by authorities.  Post 9/11, a _large_ majority of passengers would be willing to fight to the death.  When Richard Reid tried to detonate his shoe bomb, he was detected by an alert flight attendant, who basically said ""get him!"" to the other passengers.  They completely subdued him.  This pattern of incident has been repeated several times.  (Mostly with mentally unstable passengers, granted.)
 - Entirely inconsistent rules applied at different airports.  If they were important rules, they should be uniform rules.

324,TrueAskReddit,"Pro-choice people: If a procedure existed that could transfer a fetus, would it still be ethical to allow abortions?","In certain circumstances, I'm sure abortions would still be ethical. For instance, if the fetus were morbidly malformed and could not survive on it's own ever, there would be no point in a transfer.  On a personal level, I hate the idea of abortion but given the overpopulation of the planet and the fact that most of us have a detrimental impact on its state of health, I believe that abortions are actually quite ethical for those who want them. Just as legal/assisted suicide may be compassionate and responsible in some ways as long as there are no more merciful alternatives for those who are suffering so severely. This is a very sticky issue though - ""we"" are not sufficiently enlightened or knowledgeable about ourselves to allow too much leeway in matters like this - it wouldn't take much before we were living in a very callous state and deciding that certain ""types"" or ""mutations"" should be terminated and to generally have little value placed on life resulting in forced or planned euthanasia, abortion, and why not bring back executions too for good measure?"

Generally, the settlements reached don't actually have the banks admitting they did anything wrong. In this circumstance, it seems slightly different so there will definitely be future suits against JP coming up. 

The reason most cases end up settling for less has to do with how lopsided the funding of these investigations is. The banks toss everything at them and the SEC is understaffed to ever take it to court. Hence settling for pennies on the dollar to at least reap some benefit. "
326,TrueAskReddit,What degree of commitment should a healthy friendship have?,"Healthy friendships seem to develop naturally from a mutual respect for one another.

327,TrueAskReddit,Why have prices for services such as health care and education risen so much over the past fifty years?,"For education I think its partly due to the nature of how student loans work. The government made it so there is a very low barrier to get student loans, so that anyone who wanted an education could conceivable have access to it--a good idea. However there were compromises made to mitigate risk on the behalf of the lender.  Its very little risk for a lender to loan the money to the student. The debts are very rarely discharged, meaning bankruptcy typically does not effect them. Also the benefit of increased income due to high education makes it even more likely to for the lender to get payment.

Subsequently there is a surplus of money on behalf of the student allowing them to seek education without too much regard for cost...at least in the short term.  Universities have taken note and increased prices because people will pay for it regardless.

California state universities just got busted for this. They've been caught drastically increasing tuition over the years even though there is a billion dollar surplus in the system...So a bunch of students are essentially paying for the university system to ""profit""."

330,TrueAskReddit,Why is it so socially awkward to greet old acquaintances in public?,"A little bit of an oversimplification, but I think it gets my idea across.

Basically, people can be put into 3 groups: friends, acquaintances, and those you have never met.  Friends you are presumably close to, and so no awkwardness occurs when you see them.  You have plenty to talk about and you are comfortable with one another when you are not talking.  

For people you've never met, you can fall into your standard ""meeting people routines.""  You've subconsciously (or maybe consciously) come up with a few common things to say when you are getting to know people.  What school do you go to?  Any siblings?  What is your job?  etc...

But acquaintances fall somewhere in the middle, and it is here where I am the most awkward.  I'm at the point where I've usually gone through all the little small talk-y things (or at least enough that I don't want to risk repeating myself), but have not spent enough time with the person to have a ton of experiences in common.  We have no in-jokes and we know very little about the other person, so even though you feel compelled to have a conversation (because if you didn't that would be rude) you don't know what to make it about exactly.  Maybe you don't remember some of the little things they said from last time.  Or maybe you just didn't like them very much last time.  Whatever the reason, you aren't at the stage were silence is comfortable, but you aren't at the stage where casual conversation is comfortable either.  "
331,TrueAskReddit,What are the risk of USA becoming an failing autocratic state ?,"Of course there is a risk of the U.S. becoming a failed state by some definition. That was always a risk. I suppose the question is whether or not the U.S. has already become a failed state.

I want to describe two modes of evaluating an institution. The first is in its stated goals. The second is in the measured outcomes that the institution actually creates. The United States government, and any government for that matter, can be evaluated under these modes. The United States constitution, and all of the subsequent legislation and legal precedent, can be used to describe the stated goals of the state.

The outcomes are much more difficult to measure. It is difficult to measure what is an outcome specifically tied to those precedents (the U.S. constitution and subsequent legislation and legal precedent), and what can be measured as an effect of people's individual actions, the chaotic nature of life and reality, etc.

I want to point to a couple sources of corruption in our current systems. The first is the Citizens United ruling by the Supreme Court. I'm sure most people are aware of this ruling and its effect on our politics, but for those who aren't I'll summarize it here. Citizens United is a ruling that, generally speaking, allows corporations to donate limitless sums of money to political campaigns, and that money is protected under the first amendment, as free speech.

The outcome of this ruling is basically to legally condone the purchasing of legislative influence over our government. Our legislators are to one degree or another beholden to their donors, and in some cases the influence is total. That is one mechanism by which corporations exercise influence over government.

Another source of corruption in our government is regulatory capture. I'm sure most of you reading this are familiar with the phrase, but for those who aren't, I'll describe it generally here. Regulatory capture is a method to circumvent the founding principles of regulatory bodies. For example, a regulatory body such as the Environmental Protection Agency was founded in response to egregiously dangerous business practices that were having a large, and detrimental impact on the environmental systems that we rely on for our own survival. Business practices like dumping toxic waste and manufacturing byproducts into riverways, which poses a very real threat to health and wellness, both of people and other species, plants and animals.

Regulatory capture happens when an agent of those polluting industries, which become fed up with the higher cost of complying with the regulations of the EPA, take positions of power within the agency, and exercise that authority to loosen the restrictions put on the industries the EPA was founded to regulate.

Both of these problems are massive, and require serious, dedicated action to correct. In the example of the Citizens United ruling, it is going to require, I believe, 35 states to ratify a constitutional amendment, or it is going to require a case be brought forward to the Supreme Court, and the Justices there would have to overturn the previous decision.

I wrote all of this off the top of my head, and I think it's important to mention that this is my understanding of the situation, and I could very well be wrong about the details. If I am wrong, it is not my intent to spread misinformation, and in that vein I am open to critique and correction. The gist of my post, however, I believe is on point."
332,TrueAskReddit,"What factors have lead up to the UK voting leaving the EU (""Brexit"") and what potential results can be expected?","As far as I can tell, from within the UK, there are a number of factors that led to the vote.

There was a working class dislike of the free movement part of Europe, which was viewed as taking jobs from English people. The same force regarding Mexicans that has driven so much support to Trump. Globalisation doesn't work for everyone.

The working class press was very much pushing for Brexit, using the free movement issue above all. They were doing it for their own self interest. Murdoch didn't like the fact that he couldn't push around the EU like he could UK governments.

A political vacuum around the right-wing, working class vote gave space for UKIP to spring up. The party drove the issue initially and prompted Cameron to promise a referendum as a campaign promise to stop losing voters from that demographic.

Cameron made bold statements about getting power back from Brussels in return for him campaigning to remain in the EU. Unfortunately, the deal he managed to get was incredibly weak, and even those small concessions were threatened to be vetoed by the EU members, as the EU didn't take the possibility of Brexit seriously.

Factions within the conservatives supported Brexit as a means to secure power, knowing that Cameron would have to resign."
333,TrueAskReddit,Is it wrong to contribute nothing to soceity?,"As long as the person is appropriately consuming resources (ie. not stealing or actively harming society by over-consuming) and there were taxes paid on the income that is being used to support him (not on welfare or disability), then I don't think that there is anything morally wrong with being a NEET."
334,TrueAskReddit,Are people too quick to say something is racist?,"Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The problem is we're living in a society that is inherently racist and I think feelings of being discriminated against can manifest in ways that they necessarily shouldn't. 

For example: racial profiling is a real problem.  Anecdote: I have two male friends who have had very different experiences.  One is white and rich, the other is Asian but looks Mexican to most and not at all rich.  White friend was driving his Mercedes, speeding, and ran a stop sign. The cop was polite to him and let him go.  This kind of thing happened a lot to him.  Asian friend was going 5 over on a deserted street, driving a 15 yr old Toyota.  Cop pulled him over and ticketed him.  Then the cop asked if he was on drugs and made a comment about his pupils being big.  He had black eyes, it's impossible to tell and he doesn't do drugs.  Cop demanded he let him search his car, keeping in mind my friend had been extremely polite and respectful to the cop, was barely speeding, and has never been convicted of any crime.  He let the cop search his car, the cop found nothing, but continued to harass my friend.  He finally let him go and said that he knew my friend was doing something wrong but couldn't hold him any longer.  This was not the first time an experience like that happened to that friend. 

I know this is just one anecdote and not a universal experience, but this kind of thing happens all the time.  And then statistics show that black males commit more crimes than any other group (percentage wise at least).  Part of the reason for this is profiling; when you're only looking for one type of person, you will find one type of person.  

This, understandably, creates a lot of anger from both innocent and guilty black men (as well as sympathizers, which can consist of any demographic at all).  And then something like the Zimmerman fiasco happens.  A half-white man with a white last name makes an assumption about a black teenager and the teenager ends up dead.  It doesn't matter what the other details of the case are, some of that anger that so many people have is going to spill over into this case.  Does that mean Zimmerman was a racist?  It doesn't matter to them; it's just another example of a black person who paid the consequences of profiling.  

And that's not to mention how black people live in a society where most TV and film stars are white, heroes are white, presidents are white, congress is white, etc.  Black people are told by our media that they are criminals, bad fathers, lazy mothers, ignorant and stupid.  Similar things happen to women, LGBT, and fathers but in different ways.  They have a lot of resentment built up over years and years, and the Zimmerman trial was an example of an opportunity to let some of that resentment out.  "
335,TrueAskReddit,Is there a huge maturity difference between 18 and 20 years old?,"I don't think age matters as much as experience.  Most US 18-year-olds live with a parent, attend high school, hang out with the peer group they grew up with, work only part-time.  Many 20-year-olds in the US have at least at some point lived independently in an apartment or dorm, gone to college classes, have broken away from their peer group and formed new associations, and have at least worked a forty-hour week for a couple months.  Even that small taste of adult life can make a huge difference in attitude and outlook.  Were the societal disruptions to a person's life to happen at a different age, the apparent maturity jump would happen differently too."
336,TrueAskReddit,What advantages does a dictatorship have over a democracy (assuming the dictator is not a tyrant and actually cares about the country) ?,"Dictatorships are very efficient. From an economic standpoint, decisions can be made without a lot of red tape, and a single, consistent vision can create stable long term policy. Contrast this with democracies that every 4 years are undoing laws they just did 4 years ago, or are embarking on a brand new policy that undermines the long-term goals of the previous one.

Dictatorships can also affect more long-term social change as well. Because there is less room for dissent, a dynamic, powerful leader can get past the normal obstacles of change. Look at the US where we passed Obamacare and then spent the next 8 years fighting about repealing it--in a dictatorship, not only would it that back and forth not happen, but the dictator could also improve the problems and make it even better than it is now.

A good example from history, interestingly, is Saddam Hussein. When he first came to power, he crushed any dissent and ruthlessly seized power, but he also led Iraq into an era of great prosperity. The economy boomed and his moderate Sunni faction ushered in a time of great social progress. Women were able to dress in western clothes and attend college, and Iraqi colleges were some of the best in the Middle East. Iraq throughout the 70s was a great example of a stable, progressive, and prosperous Arab state.

Until 1980, that is, when Saddam made the terrible decision to invade Iran, which turned into a military and economic disaster. Iraq went from being one of the richest and most stable states into one of the poorest, which caused a series of other desperate moves including invading Kuwait. Saddam was a very interesting man because showed the great strengths and severe weaknesses associated with dictatorships."
337,TrueAskReddit,"Has all the ""deep"" media we've consumed and forgotten about made us better people?","You said it yourself. Although we forget the essence of things, you ""remember"" your view being altered by things you have read in the past. While you might not be able to recite the plot, reading things that are 'life changing' imparts value on the reader. It shapes who they are. 

So yes, although I'm no philosopher, if the book once did change you to be a better person, there's a 90% chance the effect is ongoing. It's 2AM and I'm on my phone, but look around. We are all individuals nuanced in our identities. While we are conformist to an extent, people don't revert back to a generic persona once they forget something that changed their opinion. We read, we learn, and our individuality is constantly shaped by our experiences. Although the specifics are often lost with time, identity is a constant - and the deep media we have consumed has imparted on our subconscious, shaping us to be better people."

Also it's easier, locking someone up or hanging them is easier than providing education, reintegration and prevention programmes. Goodluck trying to get funding for ex-cons or economically disadvantaged youths. The public will say you baby them and that punishments aren't high enough.

Because this is such a common way to act nowadays it's key to start small so people don't turn on you immediately and tells you to get off your high horse or even worse sees it as you finger pointing the other way. 

I've been working on the same approach with casual misogyny and attitudes towards gender roles and it's hard but I believe that if you do it consistently and in a calm matter it can change you and even others too.

341,TrueAskReddit,"Art is clearly subjective, but is it so much so that there isn't such a thing as unquestionably bad art?","If you're using the generic term 'art', then no.  

If you want to say ""this is a well written book"", or ""this is a poorly written book"", then that is ok.  Both the good book and the bad book are still 'art' though.  

There are certain rules within every medium that can't really be broken without turning into a bad example of the medium.  A book with no words and no pictures, just 300 solid black pages, is a shitty book no matter how you want to try to define it.  You can, however, break any rule and still be art.  One could easily call that book of black pages art."

343,TrueAskReddit,What is the most effective way to stunt and snuff out corruption and theft by the wealthy/those in power?,"Transparency, shared ideas of what's right and wrong, and shame / law enforcement.  

(Need to define corruption too, there are blatant examples but many ""shades of grey"" examples too.)
 
Scandinavian countries have basically no tolerance for petty peculation - if you use your job for personal gain, someone will find out and tell on you and you will be fired.  In most former/current communist or tropical* countries, a little graft is expected.  I put this down to cultural expectations.  

If you feel you can't get ahead except by cheating, you will tend to cheat.  If you feel like most people don't cheat, you will try to expose cheaters.  So: education of how to spot and report corruption, along with strong enforcement.

344,TrueAskReddit,Are we in a new 1930' area ?,"This is interesting question and I wish I could give you a more historical answer. I think we're actually a ways of from what the world was like in the 1930s. For one the global economy, especially in the developed world, is doing quite well. In the 30s, much of the world was experiencing a financial slump. The misfortunes that this caused gave reason for people to call on autocratic leaders in the hope that breaking the static quo would fix matters. 

This actually makes our time period quite unique. It's not as clear why their is such a demand for autocratic leaders. If I were to wager a guess it's a response to globalization and the extremely rapid development of technology in the last two decades. This has frightened many conservative groups and older generations that have not been able to keep up. Unfortunately, this also happens to be the majority voting group in most countries. 

 I would be surprised if most people who voted for autocratic leaders actually understand who they're voting for. They don't see the individual as autocratic. So I'm not sure if people are intentionally turning away from democracy."

346,TrueAskReddit,What will it actually be like when the U.S. student loan bubble collapses?,"i've been in finance for 20 years, through a handful of burst bubbles and crashes, and -- while i have a healthy respect for bubbles -- i challenge a lot of what appears to be the conventional wisdom in the housing bubble aftermath that the student loan bubble ends in the same way, or even (all due respect to Mark Cuban) ends at all.  i've yet to be convinced of the avenue for a true crash.

what made the housing bubble so devastating in 2007 and 2008 was that the loans being expanded to support house price growth were being created in an off-balance sheet system of special purpose vehicles that would issue commercial paper (CP) and other debt instruments to fund large baskets of loans.  because of the way those instruments were tranched and then insured ('wrapped') much of them were issued as AAA securities, enabling a massive restricted capital pool (insurance, pension, banks, etc) to buy them. 

key #1 in this is who was doing the wrapping -- at that time, private institutions called monolines that carried sterling reputations but very little capital reserve. key #2 was that the loan performance could be drastically affected by feedback from the price of the asset -- it was not widely recognized or modeled that deteriorating loan performance could spark capital flight and a national coordinated decline in housing prices that would further deteriorate loan performance. (even though that had happened many times before....)   such a large feedback loop could destroy the monolines quickly and precipitate a disaster.

student loans are not entirely like that. key #1 is that, while plenty of capital is flowing into making student loans, the loans themselves are overwhelmingly wrapped by the United States federal government -- the investors are going to be made whole regardless, as the thing comes pre-bailed out even in the event of a wreck.  that dramatically reduces the possibility of a wreck because capital has very little reason to fly away.

key #2 also doesn't hold -- the price of the asset is the long-term value of a college education, and that is not going to decline even if the loans stop coming.  even with tuition where it is, college still represents a sterling investment to the student -- the families are going to keep coming for new loans.  and the loans themselves cannot be discharged even in bankruptcy (unlike with housing, where you can in most states mail the keys to the lender and walk).  that eliminates the feedback loop that wrecked housing.

on the one hand, there's no doubt that many kids are being saddled with lots of debt in return for spurious degrees of questionable value.  but that in and of itself is a more sustainable model than one might wish to believe -- mostly a matter of adjusting interest rates.  for a true crash to materialize, there has to be a mechanism capable of that kind of volatility.  one of the reasons student loans have become such a center of loan growth is that the financial system recognizes the absence of that mechanism.  

that's not to say it can go on without limit.  things like the [Sweet Briar capitulation](http://www.businessinsider.com/sweet-briar-college-closing-2015-3) are evidence that students are getting more cost conscious.  but tuition and fees at Sweet Briar for undergraduates were also in excess of $50,000/year for a liberal arts education that is socially desirable but otherwise difficult to monetize.  that's far from foretelling the end of higher education."

350,TrueAskReddit,What economic impacts will coronavirus have?,"Well most recessions are triggered by stochastic events and I’d consider this a stochastic event since no macroeconomic model is able to predict “sudden virus pandemic”. 

Just for definitions sake a **recession** is defined by 6-18 months of stagnant or negative gdp growth while a **depression** is 18 months or more. 

So whether or not this becomes a recession / depression depends on how long this lasts. Assuming it does last for a long time it’s within reason that this could cause a recession/depression. 

Hopefully legislators will try to enact safety nets to prevent some of the significant economic issues such as lost wages due to no paid sick leave."
351,TrueAskReddit,How do I resist letting my loss define me in a negative way?,"First of all OP, I'm very sorry for your loss.
I think what you are going through is normal within the rhelm of grief. When you experience such an important and hurtful loss it's normal to feel some days you are back to zero.

Holidays, special occasions can trigger this feeling and it's common, you aren't crazy, you aren't losing it, but this is what grief feels like and even though it sucks, it's how it is.


You lost an important person in your life and it will take time for you to heal enough to not feel these anxiety symptoms about it. How long? I don't know, most people are different however specialists say that a grief process can take between 2-3 years.

I don't know if you have someone to talk with about this. Its important having someone that can listen, either a friend, a priest etc that can be useful however I recommend you to talk to a professional like a grief counselor.

I also think that can be useful for you to talk in  a support group for people that lost their partner. Grief can be aggravated when we lose people all of a sudden, like in an accident, instead a long illness. A support group, even an online one could help you a lot.

355,TrueAskReddit,How hard is it to actually live a life illegally in a country?,"Depends on which country we're talking about. East Europe has lots of illegals from Ukraine, Russia and the Far East, like Vietnam. They rent an apartment illegally and usually work in construction, where they get paid in cash. It's generally not a big problem as those people just want to make some money to send home to their families. 

I don't think it's very hard once they get a job, as all the necessities can be bought with cash. Troubles start if they get injured or something like that, because they're not eligible for free healthcare services. 

A few years ago one construction company refused to pay their vietnamese employees for the work they've done. He said ""What are you going to do, go to the police?"" They did, won the lawsuit, got paid, then left the country. "

358,TrueAskReddit,Why is buying pre-owned media much more acceptable than file sharing?,"If you're interested in the legal reasoning rather than the social/cultural perceptions you should read about the [First-sale doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine). Here's an excerpt that should help explain:

>The first-sale doctrine creates a basic exception to the copyright holder's distribution right. Once the work is lawfully sold or even transferred gratuitously, the copyright owner's interest in the material object in which the copyrighted work is embodied is exhausted. The owner of the material object can then dispose of it as he sees fit. Thus, one who buys a copy of a book is entitled to resell it, rent it, give it away, or destroy it. However, the owner of the copy of the book will not be able to make new copies of the book because the first-sale doctrine does not limit copyright owner's reproduction right. 

So from a legal perspective selling a used CD is protected by the first-sale doctrine whereas uploading the contents to a p2p network would be considered 'reproduction' and be prohibited."
359,TrueAskReddit,Who should we listen to for a long-term strategy for beating coronavirus?,"American philosopher Charles Peirce suggested a 4 level typology for arguments:

1- instinctive (more or less arguing without thinking)

2- a priori (""we've always done it that way"")

3- authority (""because I say so"")

4- inquiry, scientific or otherwise (""I have been or I am still doing the research"")

What's interesting is that it grades the value of arguments: authority is not bad per se, it's just not as good as having done the inquiry yourself. 

So you can rely on people if you have reason to believe their comments are based on sound inquiry, by themselves or others. 

Public figures have more exposure, so they should be careful with what they base their comments on.

From that point of view, I would trust Gates more than, say... , Trump or Pence (which reminds me: religious arguments are based on authority, but can never be backed by inquiry/scientific research, which is why they should have less weight...).

368,TrueAskReddit,Should a person who owns a private business be or not be able to decide whoever goes inside based on whatever criteria they choose?,"Imagine racism is prevalent in a particular community.  Every business selling mattresses refuses to sell to people of a particular race.  Because racism is prevalent, those of that race cannot buy mattresses anywhere.

Sometimes society will not self-govern to remove x-ism.  In such a case, it falls upon the government to force removal of x-ism.

This is why, for example, the US Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and why the Supreme Court ruled in *Heart of Atlanta Motel* that the Civil Rights Act is Constitutional.  If business owners can select their clientele, then the Civil Rights Act should not have been passed; blacks in the deep south should continue to be disenfranchised; and government should stay out of society.

But there are groups of people in the United States who are protected classes due to the empirical evidence that they will be discriminated against in society and relegated to becoming second-class citizens--unless the government interferes.  And so the government *should* interfere to prevent society from degrading into one of castes.

Your argument is to leave choice in all matters to the business-owner--but this is a non-choice if the community pressures the business-owner to act a certain way through indoctrination or boycotts.

369,TrueAskReddit,What's wrong with political correctness?,"The devil is in the details, of course.  There is absolutely nothing and completely everything wrong with ""PC"" depending on context.  

PC, in general, is a fucking fantastic thing.  Like, not using a cultures' name for getting ripped off (Gypped, Jewed), not treating gayness as either other or lesser (lol fag, thats pretty gay, homo), those sorts of ""just be a decent person ok?"" things are pretty damned reasonable.  If PC is solely about not being an asshole, then why are people so salty?  

Because the question you asked was ""what's *wrong* with political correctness"" I'm going to be focusing on negatives and criticisms much more from here on in.  That there are positives and clear winning points doesn't really need elaboration or belabouring.  

Before I go there, though: there's a *massive* range of different greys here, nothing is black or white, and two slightly different versions of PC will disagree on a wide range of things.  The critics hold all applications of PC to its worst and most extreme examples, while proponents similarly defend the whole practice using the best and most reasonable examples.  This makes conversations around the idea really confusing and generally quite charged, because the two sides are talking about nearly completely different versions.  

The ""real"" answer as best as I can figure is somewhere in between and tends to get overlooked because it involves far more maybes and grey areas and context than makes for fun and easy soundbites to rally behind.  

In many cases, PC doesn't believe in context or nuance, and when those things are accounted for, the allowance is nowhere near as liberal as others might desire.  Take the word ""fag"" - we can all easily and reasonably agree that it's not an appropriate word for describing gay man in, say, a news article.  It's generally not a word you'd use at high volume in a crowded room full of strangers.  There are a lot of clearly *inappropriate* contexts for ""fag"" but *are there any contexts it's acceptible, permissible, or reasonable*?  Like, is it reasonable for me to have used it twice in the span of this paragraph?  

What about ""in private""? Is ""private"" a thing, is it actually an extenuating or excusing context?  I think back to high school, when we used to crack very racist jokes around our lunchroom table.  We were the only people who had that room, and we were a group of 12 or so kids who looked like a trite stock photo of ""diversity,"" we were comfortable we weren't racist. To us, the joke wasn't that Jews have pointy noses, or Chinese people do math - the joke was that there are people who actually believe this ridiculous shit.  But there's no way a stranger or a fly on the wall or what have you would understand that.  They'd just think we the most diverse KKK meeting out there; we didn't understand that someone unaware of our intent would be hurt or offended, because we didn't mean it ""like that"".  

But there's a whole lot of complexity we didn't understand.  That jokes might normalize attitudes or provide ""latent"" racism a place to lurk and grow escaped us, that we were giving voice to attitudes society shouldn't have at all escaped us, that what we *meant* wouldn't prevent us from hurting someone walking by never even occurred.  If ""private"" is an excusing context, what is ""private enough""?  

Context gets worse, or at least messier, as we delve deeper though.  Should context excuse gay communities attempting to reclaim and destigmatize ""fag"" as a term?  Similarly, black people using ""nigger"" or ""nigga"" to refer to each other or in cultural artifacts like music or literature.  Those same terms make other people from the same group exceptionally uncomfortable and even may still make some of the in-group uncomfortable if used by the out-group, like straight people or whites.  How black is ""black enough"" that using slurs or attempting to reclaim them is ok?  

I'm these words ""meta"" if you will, as a word that is an example, not as a slur in and of itself.  But to some people, even using it to discuss itself is insensitive and hurtful and inappropriate - think how for instance American news media almost always refers to [""the n-word"" rather than ""nigger""](https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/n-word-vs-cracker.jpg).  

So when you have a group that believes some words should never be used at all for ""PC reasons"" - this gets hella messy with both terms, just as some gay communities are reclaiming ""fag"" and some black people are comfortable using ""nigga"" referring to each other, other members of those same communities are intensely uncomfortable with those terms being used at all.  

PC easily gets used more as ""word police"" than a system of values promoting not being an asshole.  If some black people or some gay people are uncomfortable with the terms that used to exist commonplace slurs, do all of that group also lose any rights to use it?  Does everyone?  

A really fantastic example of this is a recent decision to publish a version of Huckleberry Finn that has every instance of ""negro"" or ""nigger"" replaced with ""slave"" - despite the fact that the book itself is a historical artifact that's similarly using the term as an artifact in dialogue in the course of establishing a cultural setting alongside the geographical one.  Or even more appropriately To Kill a Mockingbird was condemned by some Canadian school boards for using ""nigger"" in the course of what is widely regarded as an instrumental piece of literature for the Civil Rights movement and an all around condemnation of racism.  Their concern?  That the word's use would make some students uncomfortable, in spite of its context.  

In this vein, PC treats word policing as one and the same as solving the underlying issues.  It is far more important to use the right words than have the right attutude, in this case - it's possible to present exceptionally slanted or even racist content without once using any of the ""bad words"" that PC is concerned with.  

An example here I've always loved was people with metal or cognitive disabilities - ""retards"" - and our childhood usage of the PC terms around the playground as slurs.  The real issue of course *should* have been that a bunch of kids were using an innate status (something someone else has no choice in as part of their identity, like race, sexuality, or disability) as a slur.  Like, it didn't matter what the word was, using ""disability"" as an insult was bad.  But what we understood then was that calling people ""a retard"" was bad, the correct term was ""special needs"" - so next time they were ""special"" rather than retarded.  The intent was still there, the harm to both subject and status was still there, we were just using the current word.  

A lot of critics see this side of PC and quite reasonably see this as substantially selling short the complexity of the issues it attempts to tackle.  But that is holding PC to perhaps an unfair standard: ""if it's failing to solve racism completely and utterly, why bother at all?"" At its core, PC isn't necessarily trying to solve those things.  It's a much simpler goal of ""we can't fix the underlying issue, but we can reduce the ability of these attudes to directly harm their victims and even a little bit is good enough"".

Which conveniently segues into the last big criticism of PC, which is that if allowed absolutely free run to its most absurd extent: it intends to make sure no one, espcially from a marginalized demographic, is ever uncomfortable.  

No one can ever be offended, hurt, or slightly marginalized by anyone else's expression.  Language is forever playing keepaway with needing a way of saying ""disabled"" or ""black"" or ""female"" without providing a term that can ever be used against or taken harmfully by that group.  In order to ""be PC"" one has to take into account each and every marginal perspective and be prepared to adapt on the fly to fix any semantic misstep in order to better accommodate this or that hypothetical victim.  People who dislike, fear, or criticize PC are often very afraid of being seen as racist, or worse, labelled as racist, simply for not sanitizing their language adequately.  

They may *be* racist.  Don't get me wrong, it could be true.  But most of those folks don't think they're racist, and don't understand the complexities of modern race politics well enough to understand things like latent or institutional or systemic prejudice.  In fact, most of those folks understand racism is bad and being racist is worse and that is why they're so afraid of the label.  Because they know it's bad and don't want to be bad.  

But the last big objection to ""PC"" is the one I give the most weight to: it's used as a placeholder.  

Rather than explain why telling racist jokes even when you're not racist might still be harmful and bad, we hear ""it's not PC.""  Rather than discuss the complexities of the word ""nigger"" and the black community's relationship with it, we just learn ""its not PC"" for white people to use.  

By simply replacing argument and discussion with ""PC"" or ""not PC"" we're skipping over the most important part of asking people not to use a given term.  We tell kids ""fag"" isn't PC and don't use it, so they use ""gay"" instead rather than learn that using someone's sexuality *as* an insult is bullshit and stupid.  By almost viciously labeling and shaming offenders, we set people who honestly probably *want* to be allies on the defensive, we craft an us vs them conflict and automatically seed them in with the racists and homophobes, while confirming to them that the racists and homophones were right when they complained about ""everyone just being too sensitive"" "
370,TrueAskReddit,How was it to live in 1980's USA?,"I was in my twenties in the 1980's, so I was then, about the age of most Redditors now.

More then anything to me, it was an age of cynicism, posturing, greed, and hedonism.  And I was right there along for the ride.

When Ronald Reagan won the 1980 election, the country was in the depths of a collective national funk.  Nobody had any faith in the political institutions of the day, the economy was sputtering, and America's prestige worldwide was at a low ebb.

The dreams of both the Great Society and the Woodstock hippies had collided and dashed each other to pieces during the seventies, and the emotional exhaustion was palpable.  Nobody had won, and the sense was that the cultural disconnection between the older and younger generation would continue indefinitely and cripple the nation.

Reagan, you must remember, was not a heroic-looking figure back at the beginning.  If anything, he appeared to be a washed-up second-rate movie star, the oldest elected president ever, and, outside of a fringe group of right-wing zealots, was viewed as a bit of a crackpot and a potentially unreliable hand on the nuclear 'button' during the height of the cold war.

Within a couple of short years, Reagan had managed to effectively end an inflationary spiral, and, through a leadership style designed for maximum television exposure, had re-invigorated the American psyche.  This, of course, came at a price, although we didn't see it at the time.  

While I truly believe that Reagan's intent was to exhort people to be industrious and optimistic, the actual result of both his policies and persona was to unleash a wave of young, greedy, amoral Wall Street yuppies, while WWII-era elders were given tacit permission to disengage from economic and political life, and reap in ever-increasing government-sponsored benefits, far in excess of the contributions the put into the system.  

Elders continued, nominally, to hold the reins of power, and give a veneer of respectability to the process, but younger, less scrupulous, shamelessly ambitious anti-hippies swarmed out of Middle America and into the centers of finance and government, set the cultural tone of recklessness into high gear, and the Reagan Revolution was on.

Geez, you pushed one of my buttons.  I'm waxing poetic about this crap and I haven't even got past 1983.  Gotta go, comment if you want more."
371,TrueAskReddit,Why are so many people who are pro-Gay Marriage against incestuous gay marriage? Don't the same arguments apply?,"Realistically the reason is probably simple prejudice and stigma, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a legitimate reason to treat homosexual and incestuous marriage differently.

The most obvious is that not allowing homosexual marriages prevents homosexuals from ever marrying someone they are sexually attracted to. This is a much bigger cost to them then ruling that people cannot marry one specific person they are attracted to, since presumably they could find others. Additionally the interest in incest (whether it be societal or not) is extremely low, meaning there is little impetus to change it for the few who desire it.

Finally, and most importantly, there are significant costs to incest that don't exist for gay couples.

I posted this in response to another similar question. It is two major harms to incest that don't exist for homosexual marriage (I removed the genetics point). 

>1) Incest creates unequal relationships that are prone to abuse and issues of consent. Families are not a group of equals. Even between sibling there are significant differences in authority (older-younger sibling dynamics) but this is especially true for parent-child dynamics. It is questionable whether any consent given from a child to a parent can ever really be considered non-coercive. In the same way that the law protects against other coercive relationships (therapist-patient or teacher-student for instance, it makes sense to protect people from this. Gay relationships on the other hand are of equals who can freely consent, not necessitating any government protection.

>2)Incestuous relationships eliminate the safe space of the family. Our society is highly dependent on the structure of the family. It is where we learn our values and are generally socialized to be part of the community. Introducing a sexual dynamic inside of the family structure, opens up families to problematic dynamics such as hostility and insecurity. I think we can all see the problem of having children fear that they are the target of sexual aggression in their own homes and that their parent is merely waiting for them to turn eighteen to sleep with them. Since all reputable studies indicate that the children of gay parents do no worse than the children of straight parents, this type of argument cannot be likewise used against gay marriage.

372,TrueAskReddit,Does the Ebola outbreak in Africa pose a real and serious threat to western society or is there an air of media sensationalism surrounding it?,"As the CDC just announced:

>There is no significant risk in the U.S. While it is unlikely that the disease would spread if imported into the United States, the recent infections in U.S. healthcare workers working abroad highlight the need for vigilance.

373,TrueAskReddit,How do (personally) decide what information sources to trust?,"Reliable information is hard to find, but you can check off a positive and negative list whenever you see a news article:

- Is the headline hyperbolic (overexaggerating) and full of heated, 'scary' looking buzzwords? If so = bad.
- Does the article come from a news source that has an international presence and a long reputation for being honest? If so = good.
-Does the article have named eye witness testimonies or links to primary sources of information? If so = good.
- If it's science or medicine related, does the article have scientific proof (a link to a peer reviewed journal article)? Read the article. Does the article contain the same info as the news report? If so = good. 
- Does the article appear one-sided? Is it blaming a particular group of people, or trying to make you scared of something? This is fearmongering, and is bad.
- Does the article use multiple Whatifisms? (literally, 'but what if...') These phrases are designed to confuse readers and push ideas that have no relevance or proof. They are bad.
- Is this news, or opinion? If it contains personal pronouns (eg: I think... Seems to me like...). Biased personal views = bad.

Things to look up after reading a news article:

- Who owns this website/TV station/newspaper? Do they have a known political agenda? Is itlikely that what you just read/saw has a strong leaning based on the owner's personal affiliations?
- Who is the author of the article and what else have they written? Do they have a notable reputation in journalism?
- Fact check yourself: if you tried to investigate the same issue, can you easily find proof that the article's report contains real facts?
- Does the TV report or newspaper headline feel like it's trying to 'grab' you (eg: clickbait) or actually inform you? 

It's hard, really. But searching yourself for multiple sources and articles, other than sticking to just one for all your news, is often they way people avoid becoming trapped in a biased cycle. Keep in mind, if the report was real, multiple sources would be publishing it. If it's isolated to one channel/newspaper, perhaps it's not all that reliable..."
374,TrueAskReddit,Why has being transgender not received the same acceptance as homosexuality/bisexuality?,"There are a number of factors at work. Changing genders is harder to understand/accept than liking the same gender. Billy Bob is still Billy Bob even when he comes out as gay. It just is another thing to know about Billy Bob. Billy Bob becoming a woman is not Billy Bob anymore.

People probably know someone gay. That helps. Transgender people I believe are a much smaller minority.  So, people dont met them as often and they suffer from medias interpretations and peoples wild imaginations."
375,TrueAskReddit,"The Catholic Church has said that Climate Change is real, humans are a major cause, and it is our moral imperative that we try to stop it. With that in mind, is their stance of anti-abortion and anti birth control contradictory to their moral imperative why or why not?","First of all, the initial premise is flawed.  While it is true that Pope Francis has asserted that climate change is real and that humans are a major cause of it, even choosing to enshrine this ideology in his encyclical Laudato Si, it is in no way a part of the infallible magisterium of the Catholic Church.  Catholics should heed the words of the Holy Father in Laudato Si and be more diligent to care for the environment, but there is absolutely nothing novel being put forth in the encyclical which requires the assent of divine faith.

Even assuming that it is binding on all the faithful to accept that it is our ""moral imperative to try to stop climate change"", there would be absolutely no contradiction with the Church's stance on abortion and contraception.  The Church does not call us to protect the environment for the sake of the environment itself, but for the fostering of the dignity of the human race.  Abortion - the taking of an innocent life - can be justified by no means whatsoever.  The Church has always taught this and always will.  The idea that because the Church is advocating more responsible care for the environment makes her stance on abortion and contraception contradictory is nonsense.  The reasons Catholics are called to care for the environment is for the benefit of humanity, for God has given mankind dominion over the environment.  The Church would never condone the taking of innocent life to protect a lesser good - namely the environment."
376,TrueAskReddit,Is being funny a learned skill?,"I've taken improv classes and even run a workshop or two. Here are some thoughts.

Comedy is hard. It often looks easy, but it seldom is.

""Don't be funny"" is one of our rules in improv. In general, people who think they're funny and do some kind of schtick are terrible at improv. Of course, there are different forms of comedy. Nevertheless, I find it funnier when people aren't being jokey but playing it straight yet absurd.

We train a lot in improv. And the training makes us better. There are certainly skills that can be honed. Timing is one of them, and timing is very, very important in comedy. 

Another guideline we have is that the improv works best when it comes from a real place. There's a personal element, or at least something that other people can connect with. This guideline also holds true for humor in general, I feel.

In the end, I would say that... yes, you can practice, train, and improve on humor as a skill. But before you train, you should develop a good mindset and attitude. Read about schools of improv to understand what that might mean."
377,TrueAskReddit,Will the US be eventually overtaken as the preeminent military power in the world by china within our lifetime?,"China has quite a way to before it overtakes the US.

Its greatest strength is sheer manpower. Its allies aren't the most reliable either. 

Contrast that with US forces that are at the forefront of military technology and innovation, are combat tested and experienced and has true force projection capability. Its logistics chain is easily the best in the world and its allies reliable and equally as competent."
378,TrueAskReddit,How are mass protests effective? Won't the government just ignore protesters indefinitely?,"Although I see your point, I  think the elites are far more worried about this than you might imagine. The incentive to change things to appease the protestors is simple: money. 

Since these protests began Hong Kong's economy is really suffering and continues to suffer in numerous  ways (www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-28/hong-kong-traders-brace-for-selloff-on-protest-crackdown.html). The longer the protests continue, the stronger the need to end protests. Simply cracking down on protests only temporarily covers up the political dissatisfaction and underlying social unrest. Investors are aware of these and will be wary to invest in a country likely to have further political turmoil. 

If you doubt the fear of the rich elites, look at the facts:

>Hong Kong’s top dog: Leung Chun-ying, also known as C.Y. Leung, is a private businessman and former real estate executive with long-standing ties to Beijing. He has appealed to protesters to withdraw for the sake of Hong Kong’s** image and stability.**

>The tycoons: Billionaire businessman Li Ka-shing, Asia’s wealthiest person, was among dozens of tycoons summoned to Beijing last week for meetings with top leaders as the political tensions in Hong Kong mounted. So far, Hong Kong’s capitalists have remained in the background as the protests have gathered momentum.

>Source: www.globalnews.ca/news/1587652/hong-kong-protests-key-issues-and-people-in-the-dispute/

Although the elites are sitting back to see how this plays out, they are under immense pressure from the global investment/trade community to fix this problem. They might not be in any danger themselves, but if they can appease protestors to bring back order, the longterm prospects for international investment is regained. They will have the biggest influence on what happens and their primary concern is social stability, not the exact government in power. As long as a new government isn't anti-capitalist (which it won't be), the costs of potentially less favourable tax policies will preferable to drawn out social unrest. 

Who knows what elites will do, or if any concessions will bring about stability. But I do think this economic factor is significant for potential change. "

380,TrueAskReddit,"If life is meaningless, and we make our own meaning by trying to accomplish, does life lose meaning with increasing age/accomplishment?","I'm 41. I've spent a little time accumulating years. It has been my experience, as someone who believes your first two statements, that the opposite is true.

The longer you live the more loss you will experience. Projects you invest in will not bear fruit. People you trust will betray you. People you love will die. Eventually your own body and mind will turn on you as well. 

While all the loss is painful and hard it is also, if you permit it to be, a profound source of compassion. If, in our personal experiences of deep suffering, we can step outside of ourselves and see that we are not alone in these experiences, that they are inseparable from the experience of being alive, and as such we do not invite our suffering by being ""bad"", then the experience of being alive is invested with a more profound poignance. Poignance, I believe, is the emotional experience of meaning.

This sense of poignance becomes available not only in suffering, but in pleasant and joyful experiences as well. Having gone through deep suffering, and knowing that we will have to go through it again, makes those times when everything is OK so delightful. It makes those times of joy so much more joyful. It makes it easy to be grateful. AND it infuses even the smallest kindness with meaning.

I'm not sure if I'm explaining myself very well. But, as I stated at the beginning, it has been my experience that the longer I live the more meaningful my experience becomes."

In the past The USA or Russia would have acted. But since China holds a lot of money on those 2 they won't. Politically speaking everyone is tied up.

Business are tied up due to money, China has billion dollar markets, that is reason enough to do what they do. Until India and Latin America's development reaches China levels, they will be tied. Latin America due to being an undervalued market and India due to population growth.

383,TrueAskReddit,"With all the recent conflict, and people speculating on World War 3, what would happen to an average person like myself if a world war were to breakout? How would I be affected?","We have never seen two 1st world countries really go at it with truly modern military hardware. I think most people tend to think of a large global war in ww2 terms, which makes sense on some level since that is probably the closest thing we have to compare, but I don't think the model will be close *at all*. The nature of warfare between countries at the technological level we're currently at will be something totally different from what we've ever seen because the world is completely different. Basically I believe a new World War would be a lot closer to ww1 than ww2 (hear me out). At the beginning of ww1 there was a *bunch* of new military technologies around that had only really been tested in colonial conflicts where their effectiveness/potential uses weren't fully realized due to the fact that the forces using them were relatively overpowered even without them. That's the situation we're currently in, we can't *really* know what the game changers are until it (and I hope it doesn't) happens.

In summation, while this is a fun question I don't believe anyone is able to say what a global conflict between world powers would look like in the modern age, technology has come so far that I believe the tactical situation will be so different from what we've seen that trying to predict it is an almost futile effort. The only certainty in my opinion is that nobody would really know what to do at first, there would be a year or two where we would have to invent new ways to wage war."
384,TrueAskReddit,How is it feasible for the US end the electoral college system of voting for the president?,"We're 60% there already. 10 states and the District of Columbia (representing a total of 165 electoral votes, or 60% of those necessary to elect the president) have already signed the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. 

Once enough states to represent 270 electoral votes have signed this compact it goes into effect, and when it does the states that have signed it are required to assign their electoral votes based on the national popular vote, not the popular vote on their individual state.

This works because states are allowed to assign their electoral votes however they see fit, and this is the only way of eliminating the power of the Electoral College without a constitutional amendment.

385,TrueAskReddit,What does the American work life look like?,"It depends on the job you're working. But for me in my office programming job, I get about two weeks worth of paid time off per year. I earn a couple hours of it each pay period and have to save up to use it. This is pretty standard for full time employment. That said, my employer will work with me if I want to take time off and don't have enough time saved up and let me borrow against time I don't have. This is in addition to the 5 or 6 Federal Holidays that my employer gives us off, too. Plus, each quarter of the year, my employer gives me one floating holiday that I can use any day I'd like.

I also get another 14 days per year of sick time. Obviously if I come down with something serious where I can't work for longer periods of time, my employer will work with me if I have a doctor's note. These aren't necessarily hard numbers, just what the payroll system keeps track of. I'm not sure how much of this is mandated. I don't think there are any requirements by law, but the two weeks or so of vacation time is pretty standard everywhere.

Taking a whole summer off would just never happen unless you have a crap ton of time saved up. And even then, it's unlikely that your employer would let you take more than a month off at a time.

I can't speak much for maternity leave. But there are Federal laws regarding that entitling women to specific amounts of time off. How much you get is up to the employer, but there is a minimum set by law - just not sure what it is. I've seen many men get time off when a new baby comes too, but I'm not sure about the laws regarding that.

As for healthcare, it's tied to employment by law, though you can get insurance on the market if you don't have a job or work part time and have an employer who doesn't offer it. It makes it easier for me - an extra benefit and I don't have to worry about paying bills or managing it at all. After I start working, I automatically get insurance cards and such sent to my home and I'm good to go. Payment comes out of my paycheck, but the employer pays most of the monthly cost, so it's cheaper than buying it myself. My employer also offers dental and vision insurance - which I also have. Employer insurance also can cover spouses and kids. Just costs a little more to the employee out of their paycheck each month.

If I lose my job, I have options. Like I said before, I can buy insurance on the market. Not the cheapest, but not terrible depending on the coverage you get. There's also unemployment health insurance you can qualify for at a subsidized price. And the US has an unemployment system where if you can prove you're actively looking for work after leaving a job, you get monthly checks that equate to a portion of your previous salary. Combine the two, and most people can get by. Also, if you're working a full time office job and they let you go (layoffs instead of being fired or quitting), quite a few companies offer severance packages where they keep paying you and your insurance for a few months after termination.

Would I like more time off over the course of the year? Yeah. But I think for the country's average salary and such, what we have is very fair. I work 40 hours per week and my employer doesn't require any overtime. I get every weekend off. And if I need to do something like go to a doctor's appointment during the day, I don't have to ask my boss to leave or anything. I just go and don't have to use vacation time or anything. I can work late the next day, come in early later in the week, whatever. They don't care as long as I'm putting in the full 40 hours by the end of the week and as long as I'm here for necessary meetings. This is fairly common for salary office jobs.

EDIT: I forgot to mention, we do have low income/disability insurance here, too. Things like Medicare/Medicade help people who don't have jobs and is basically free insurance for people who meet certain criteria. But it's not accepted everywhere (though, I've yet to see a doctor who doesn't take it, personally). Also, I can get disability insurance as part of my benefits package through my employer and if I get hurt at work, I'd be mostly covered. Though, that's not a huge concern for me. My employer also offers life insurance to all employees at no additional cost to the employee. So if I die while employed (doesn't have to be work-related), my family gets a payout. "

389,TrueAskReddit,Why do we have political parties?,"It's a mathematical inevitability if you use a ""First-Past-The-Post"" voting system, aka ""Winner-Takes-All."" All you need is 50.1% to win, so if there are more than two parties, minority parties can find success by making compromises and merging their votes. 

If you look at history, each time a third party started to gain popularity, it took away votes from the party more similar to it. It's like voluntarily fracturing your own party. This all but ensures that the other party will win.

Look at the [1912 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912_United_States_presidential_election), in which Teddy Roosevelt ran in his brand-new Progressive party.  His first two terms were as a Republican, and he was still pretty popular. However, since there was also an actual Republican candidate, the Republican vote was terribly split, and Woodrow Wilson (D) won the electoral vote by a huge margin (435-96). Notice that though he won the popular vote, he got less votes than Teddy + Taft combined.

It's called the Spoiler Effect. Third parties will never, ever, ever, ever work within our system. If you join a third party, you are directly helping the party you hate the most. We have to change the way votes are allocated before we can even entertain the idea of another party."
390,TrueAskReddit,Is China an example of dictatorships working efficiently?,"I think most comments here ar missing a crucial point: Chinese thought is significantly different than western thought. They just don't place the same emphasis on individual rights and freedoms as western thought does.

In fact, with the ongoing idea crises in democratic countries, it's the best time for China to try to assert its thinking and government form as the better ones.

Personally, I think China's growth isn't sustainable  and its dominance isn't as inevitable as it seems. Rising wages and living standard on China will move manufacturing away to cheaper countries, or even back to the west. Then, on more equal footing, there will really be a conflict of ideas.

The west did surrender a lot of its capabilities (industry and knowledge) to China, and will have to fight hard to reestablish the dominance of the west and of western thought. Maybe even through military conflict."
391,TrueAskReddit,"What would happen if real, definitive evidence were to come into the public eye proving that the 9/11 attacks were actually organized by the US government?","Wow, those other posts really got off tangent of the actual question. 


TL:DR depends how much time has passed. 

US Government has been involved in several nefarious acts over the decades that have both been punished and unpunished. 


A couple quick examples:

[Iran-Contra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair) Ronald Reagan and cohorts traded a bunch of weapons to Iran in clear violation of treaties and laws. In this affair a bunch of high level people were indicted, but most were pardoned by Bush Sr.


[Tuskegee Syphilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment#Aftermath) US knowingly infected a black population with syphilis and gave them no or substandard treatment just to see what happened. Wasn't caught for decades. Bill Clinton eventually said sorry. No charges or indictments


[Japanese Internment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans) America illegally imprisons 100,000+ people just because they were of Japanese decent. $400 million was paid (20k per victim still surviving) plus we said we're sorry. 

And of course the biggest scandal in American history, where a president was brought down. A bunch of people were convicted and but Nixon got pardoned immediately.


So the answer is pretty clear. If the people are out of power, like Bush and his compatriots are now, we'd probably have a commission. Some stern things would be said. Some people might be indicted and may go to prison, but anyone senior would be pardoned. 


....Oh and we'd say sorry.

394,TrueAskReddit,"What does a hypothetical world, in which all nations are fully developed, look like?","I don't think we'd know the answer to that until it happens, if it does ever happen.  

I've thought about stuff like this a lot in the past few years, but more in the context of marginalizing the poorest demographics in the US.  Like, where's the cutoff level of income or standard of living to where the poor are no longer ""poor"", or not stigmatized?

We don't have a baseline standard of living that allows sometime to live a ""normal"" life without being in what we consider poverty.  

Maybe even more to the point, what's the level of ""poor"" where you're no longer ""poor"", and is it possible to bring the people below that threshold above it, and sustain it?  Because in the US, we don't have the same levels of poor like many other countries.  We don't have favelas, trash cities, or entire towns' worth of people living in shacks with no access to indoor plumbing.  Aside from skid-row style tent cities, the worst we have is just shitty, unmaintained versions of what rich demographics have.  Like, most everyone in the US that's not homeless has access to indoor plumbing in some form or fashion.

So my question is, what's that line?  Like what's the standard of living that would no longer be stigmatized, and will the line shift if there's nobody below it, because someone always has to be ""poor""?  

I don't know the answer to that, because I can't think of a time and place in modern human history (as in humans living in permanent settlements and cities), that one group of people hasn't been exploited by another to benefit a few elite.



To more directly answer your question, my best guess is that it won't happen.  And if it did, it would be because there is a sustainable circle of resources that costs a lot more per-person to maintain than our current use-and-discard system.  (I.e., trees are able to be reforested faster than they are cut down, plastics and metals are ""infinitely"" recycled, food waste is composted and reused, etc.)  Precious metals would probably have to be mined off-world, and production of goods would be largely automated and efficient enough to make said goods cheap enough for everyone."

Better to picture it like a sound board, with dozens of different scales for good and bad all working in tandem.

So in your hypothetical, we can now see that there are two different scales at work. There's the question of whether you're making the world a better place, and the answer is yes. That's a moral good regardless of your motive.

But then there's the question of whether or not you're a good person, i.e. a person who tends to act virtuously. What does it matter? Very little, except in terms of the reputation we assign you - a reputation being a way to track someone's likely future behaviour.

Your intention does not change the positive benefit you provided and it should be valued by society just the same. But it's possible that your reputation as a person who does good things can and should simultaneously weaken if it turns out it's all just an ego trip for you. Why should it weaken? **Because your motivation makes your future virtue less reliable.**

397,TrueAskReddit,Has online dating made it easier or harder for the average person to date and find love? Why?,"Easier to date, likely made it seem harder to find real love. Dating online has a lot of superficiality to it, you swipe based on pictures and carefully worded blurbs.     With so many people at your fingertips, it may be easier to find matches but the connectionsyou find may be skin deep. If you're meeting people in offline situations, there's likely some other connection that caused you to meet, like a common interest or hobby. "
398,TrueAskReddit,"What is an effective strategy to counteract the effects of ""fake news""?","One of the best projects I've personally seen so far is the German non-profit [Correctiv](https://correctiv.org/en/investigations/). What makes this a great approach is that [all their funding is public](https://correctiv.org/en/correctiv/finances/) and their trackrecord in terms of depth and coverage so far is amazing in German and decent in English.

The bad news is that, for obvious reasons, is that they're releasing comparatively slow and they still seem to be experimenting with various styles and ideas on how to present their articles.

[This lengthy article](https://correctiv.org/en/investigations/system-putin/) on Putin from 2015 for example lists verifiable facts with sources and connects them. At least to me it just oozes ""We did our homework as best as possible"".

[Their series on TTIP](https://correctiv.org/en/investigations/ttip/) (even though some of it is within these disgusting slideshows) is condensed and, while not as in-depth as I would have liked, at least very down to earth, verifiable and gives a decent overview. The CETA article in there is probably the best of that series.

In terms of topics covered from internal German banking issues (where according to them over 350 out of 400 banks refused to cooperate with them) over [Olive-oil-cartels](http://www.olivenoel-kartell.de/the-big-scam-of-olive-oil) all the way to [nursing homes](https://correctiv.org/en/investigations/nursing-homes/) they cover a wide variety of both comparatively unknown and current events.
____________

Overall I think this type of open, honest and professional approach is one of the best ways to deal with people shouting from either side. I'm also in general a fan of the [German Press codex](https://www.presserat.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Downloads_Dateien/Pressekodex13english_web.pdf) and think that this type of self-regulation between press organisations is what keeps some of these issues something that's much less prevalent in Germany than in the US for example.

While this clearly doesn't prevent mistakes, false reports and things being swept under the rug it creates an underlying climate in which the public can trust *most* outlets on basic issues. Even the worst of the worst outlets *usually* stick to this kind of framework because otherwise the other institutions will tear that kind of (dis)information apart.

To me the press as a whole needs to come together, agree on keeping each other accountable and restore what's left of any remaining credibility."

403,TrueAskReddit,Should people who make less than waiters be socially obligated to tip?,"To all the people saying “no way they make that much” - as someone who’s got 10 yrs+ in service industry, it’s entirely dependent on the location, but it’s not at all unreasonable to make that much waiting tables. My coworker made $300 on a 5hr shift yesterday on a particularly busy night shift. We aren’t the nicest or most expensive restaurant, and that kind of night isn’t all that uncommon. That $60/hr.

Making $150+ a shift is pretty expected if you are closing. The shifts might last 6 1/2 hrs.

The work is pretty intense and your basically running around non stop carrying and lifting things constantly while keeping shit loads of variables straight in your head - so it’s not some super easy thing to be good at, but if you’re good at it yes you can make lots of money. And yes there are plenty of people with college degrees waiting tables for exactly that reason."
404,TrueAskReddit,Have social media ruined journalism?,"Everything new that comes along takes a while for us as a society to figure out. Cell phones, online news, social media, cheap crappy fast food, or whatever, it's always a similar arc: First we enthusiastically overdose on the new thing, then we start to see the downsides of this and adjust our behavior, and eventually we reach a more reasonable equilibrium.

The headlong dive into online news had some downsides, some of which couldn't be seen at the outset. As evidence that the pendulum is swinging away from the ""everything should be free"" mentality: The New York Times's digital subscriber base has been growing at a healthy clip, recently surpassing [2.5 million digital subscribers](https://www.statista.com/chart/3755/digital-subscribers-of-the-new-york-times/).

**However**, I do have a very definite need to be connected with others -- online social media, emails, and telephone communication are **very** important to me.

Absent those connections, I see absolutely zero desire to live. For better or for worse, I stay alive because others love me more than I love myself.

It is just another example of ""the establishment"" silencing a dissenting voice.

We're very lucky not to have a lot of firsthand experience with the diseases for which we have vaccines.  This means when people are weighing the pros and cons, they have very little basis for understanding what is gained through vaccination.  Statistics are also fairly meaningless to many people, and then you have the complication of herd immunity on top of that.

409,TrueAskReddit,"What would happen if every American over the age of 18 suddenly got $10,000 injected into their online bank accounts?","If it was a one-time injection, it would not have that much of an inflationary effect. A smaller effect actually occurs every year around tax time when the backdoor state subsidies kick in (when some get earned income credit, numerous families like mine receive a child tax credit of $1,000 per child), workers get a refund on their taxes, etc. It would offer a one-time jolt to spending to the economy, spread out amongst several areas:

* Electronics and Gaming (large screen TVs, gaming consoles)
* White Goods (durable goods - new washes, dryers, refrigerators, etc.)
* Auto purchases (used cars, new cars, leases)
* Housing demand (this will increase rental prices as people who couldn't afford money for first month, last month, and deposit will be able to move, as well as increase home purchases, as more people will have money to put on a down payment)
* Travel (flights, trips, hotels, leisure)
* Debt extinguishment (a few million people will actually be responsible and use it to pay off debt - but only a few million)
* Investment or savings (a few millions not in debt would also save or invest some of this - to start businesses (still a 97% failure rate) or to save for retirement for college).

The effect on the economy would be varied, but mostly boom-bust and back to normal (there's nothing to sustain a higher level of spending once the $10,000 is gone):

* For one-shot items like car and white goods, for example, would be pulled into the present from the future. Future sales would tank for some time. The same might be said for housing demand.
* The longer-term effects would be minimal, but could be positive for some: Those few million who used the money to pay off debt could now breathe easier and start saving or spending at a higher level because their previous income was devoted to debt service. (As an aside, it's doubtful that people who have a credit card lifestyle would use the windfall to pay off debt, and then start living a straight life - they likely would just spend the $10,000 and still be in debt.) Those who used the money for a down payment on a house would buy homes at slightly inflated prices (due to a sudden increase in demand), but then they likely would no longer be paying rent and the housing market's rise would subside as demand was also pulled forward.

And I think it’s more than just loving to do something. It’s more so where you find peace.

But looking at in terms of a career, your ikigai is something you would do for free, so any money earned off of it is usually a plus.

But a lot of times, yes, if something is your art it usually becomes something else when you sell it. I used to make art and once I started selling pieces it become a chore and something I did not enjoy anymore. It was no longer mine.

412,TrueAskReddit,Should it be our right to consume and suffer the effects of psychoactive drugs?,"Legalize and regulate is the way to go for many reasons, personal liberty being one of them.

Some people will become addicts and be a detriment to society, but is that enough of a reason to deny others who can use all these illegal drugs safely? In my opinion, not even close. A vast majority of drug users do not become addicted or cause harm to society, and with ample education, robust social support systems, and strict regulation of the more dangerous and addictive substances (passing a psychological test to receive a license to buy, outlawing sales to minors, etc), the negative consequences can be minimized. 

People have had their lives changed positively in profound ways through responsible drug use. No one should have the right to deny them those tools for self improvement and enjoyment."
413,TrueAskReddit,What are the most common issues that impede our personal happiness?,"1. **Self Confidence** - without being secure in yourself and your choices you will always look to others for approval. The approval of others is often dubious and tricky to gain, so you'll never make everyone happy. A mind that trusts itself is a healthy mind. 

2. **Body image** - accepting your flaws and working to improve your body are both extremely important steps to happiness. It goes hand in hand with self confidence, but It's often overlooked, and deserves a separate mention. A healthy mind needs a healthy body.

3. **Goals** - you have to know where you're trying to go if you want to feel like you're getting somewhere. Learn new things, pick up skills that catch your eye.

4. **Mindfulness** - be aware of how you feel and who you are in the moment. It keeps expectations, goals, and perceptions grounded in reality 

5. **An Anchor** - have someone or something you can trust to be there when you need that one person to talk to. Be there for them in kind. It's about the quality of yourself and your person, that neither of you will forsake the other. It can be a companion, a platonic friend, a puppy, a good book, a specific song... someone or something that will be there to remind you that life matters in the littlest of ways.

6. **A Dream** - the opposite of your anchor. Something that makes you reach out, strive for more, and take a leap of faith. It's all about outdoing yourself. For some, this is a hobby that you're mastering. For others it is a person, a vision of the future, a career, or even something material, like a boat. I happen to look to mars, and treating patients. Your dream depends on who you are.

7. **Routine Freedom** - Freedom should be part of your routine! Those routine tasks should get you closer to your goals, but you should always have scheduled time that can be used for ANYTHING. Guilt-Free. It helps us grow, learn, and take up new skills and goals. It's also incredibly calming. Use it to do whatever you want. 

8. **Adequate Sleep** - build this into your life. You'll age better, feel better, be stronger, get sick less, and feel more awake when you are awake. It's one I'm working on, and it's not always possible, but do what you can. Most people need 6-8 hours. Find what you need, and get it every night.

9. **Mentors** - Look around you. Everyone is full of different experiences and views. They can teach you SO MUCH. Find the people in your life that will inspire you, and help you reach forward. There are many different kinds of mentors. Pick mentors who are good at what you need to improve on the most, and let their actions guide yours. 

10. **Critics** - no one likes criticism. It doesn't feel good to have flaws or mistakes pointed out. But a good critic is worth their weight in gold. Admit your mistakes quickly, fix them because you're always striving to be better. Any time you are criticized, it's because someone saw something WORTH making better. And remember that a true friend will be both your critic, your mentor, and your anchor.

414,TrueAskReddit,Bad employees can easily cost companies tens of thousands or more. Why isn't hiring more focused on weeding those types out?,"It's very, *very* difficult to do this kind of selection. Consider how difficult it is to decide if someone is a backstabber when you meet them for the first time... then put money on the table. People are *strongly* motivated to misrepresent themselves during the hiring process. Some would even argue that it's encouraged: young people are taught to dress and act better for interviews than they normally would.

Also, consider that many people's attitudes change over the course of their employment. Often the person they become is not the person you hired."
415,TrueAskReddit,What would Hitler have done after the war had he won?,"There's actually a decent answer to this; I know bits and pieces but it's better to ask in /r/AskHistorians.

First of all, he would finish exterminating the Jews and then move on to Slavic people, specifically Polish. There was a plan in place to mass-murder the Polish in the same way as Jews, a ""project"" intended to be finished somewhere in the mid-1970s.

As for Russia, assuming it had been defeated, Hitler's plan was to kill off a sizable part of the population, then let the rest live in cities, working as slaves for Germans living on farms in the Russian countryside. If the Russian population would ever try to rebel, their cities would be bombed --no harm to Germans, because they don't live there.

Again, I didn't get this information first-hand, so do check with actual historians before taking my word for it."

417,TrueAskReddit,What charities deal with systems rather than symptoms in the developing world?,"My wife works for a charity in Haiti called Be Like Brit (BLB). It's a very unique organization in a lot of ways. First of all, it's an orphanage, but it's non-adoptive. They are essentially raising all the kids there completely, more like a group home. They employ primarily other Haitians, so that the kids are raised to learn and love their own culture and language, while still having access to first world technology and medicine. 

One of the big problems with many orphanages is Haiti is that they just pump kids into the states, which does nothing to help Haiti. BLB's goal is to raise the future leaders of Haiti and help them to help their own country. The kids will have the chance to go to college in America before returning to Haiti to continue helping to build up the country. 

 If you go on one of their service trips, you get to help build homes in the grand goave community, but part of the cost of your trip goes towards hiring locals to work along side of you, providing valuable jobs for the community members while helping Americans and Haitians to learn each other's culture and language. This is very different from many other service trips with other organizations, which to me often felt like a glorified vacation that took valuable jobs away from locals that could have potentially done the work.

I'd be happy to tell you more about BLB if you like, and their website also does a good job of it. The short story is that a 19 year old Lynn University student named Brit was there on a service trip and died in the 2010 earthquake. Her parents cashed out their commercial construction business and dedicated their lives to building this orphanage in Haiti, honoring the last wish Brit made in a text message sent not long before the earthquake hit. It's a sad but beautiful story, and an incredible organization to have worked with. 

I'm sure there are many other solid non-profits that are similarly unique, but it will very rarely be the huge well known corporate non-profits in my opinion. Good luck on your search!"
418,TrueAskReddit,"Why civilizations had similar idea ""pleasures = sin"" in their history?","If you look at all civilizations from their agrarian roots there was little idle time where one could consume or indulge in pleasures. Time or materials that were not productive were seen as a waste that would surely  cause suffering in the future. Aesop's Fable ""The Ant and the Grasshopper"" comes to mind. TLDR: The ants prepare for the long winter ahead while the grass hopper indulges in the pleasures of the summer. When winter finally hits the ants are prepared while the grasshopper is left out in the cold to starve. 



The purpose of most farming was to provide subsistence, any surplus was sold off to save for potential shortcomings in the future. These ideas manifested themselves in society in a number of ways, most notably in religion. With this, the idea that ""Pleasure = Sin"" came into being. The idea translates to ""Indulgence = Waste"".



It is a natural feeling that has been engrained into our psyche for the purposes of survival. Next time you purchase something you're not sure you really need, you will experience the same phenomenon. "
419,TrueAskReddit,Are there any professions that are gender-locked for a non-social reason? Why? Is this job's gender ratio likely to change in the near future?,"Many jobs that involve manual labor are dominated by males, while many jobs that involve working with children are dominated by females. [This older paper](http://www.bls.gov/mlr/1997/04/art2full.pdf) lists several job's percentage women and how they have changed from 1975 to 1995. Mechanics and Carpenters are identified by the paper as professions that saw almost no increase in the percentage of women. Elementary Teachers and Nurses were woman dominated fields that had little change as well. 

As far as determining whether the jobs are dominated by men or women because of social or non social reasons, that is a lot tougher to determine. I can see physical differences as being the biggest reason that a job could be dominated by one gender without it social roles playing a factor. Professional athletes are majorly male and female athletes compete in separate leagues because males are physically able to outperform their female counterparts. With advances in technology and training, that may not always be the case, but it currently is. The only thing that would require a hard separation of male and female workers would be jobs relying on sexual characteristics. A surrogate mother must be female and a sperm donor must be male. 

I'm not sure if any other job can be determined to be dominated by one gender completely outside of social norms. "
420,TrueAskReddit,What would it mean for the future of the United States and the world if Donald Trump was actually elected President of the United States?,"Who knows? He's a demagogue dressed as a Republican. Any victory of his mostly has implications for the electoral process.

***
**The Primaries**

Trump may lead the GOP now, but he's the weakest GOP candidate against Clinton in the polls. In other words, when Republicans are asked who among them should be up for election against a Democrat in 2016, more say Trump than any other candidate. But when *voters*, regardless of party, are asked, in hypothetical match ups, whether they prefer Republican [X] or Clinton, Trump does badly against Clinton.

The GOP knows this and is trying to stop Trump from seizing the nomination. In some ways, this happened to the Democrats in 2008; when Obama started gaining traction against Clinton, there was some consideration of using their ""super delegates"" to stop Obama from being the nominee despite what primary-voting Democrats wanted. They were worried he might be only popular with the party but that Clinton would be better with the general public. Ultimately, they didn't go that way.

Eight years later, and the GOP is in the same situation, except they're seriously trying to stop or at least control Trump. They've asked him to tone down his inflammatory language, and they're trying to keep donors away from him and contributing to their ""serious"" candidates. 

Right now, the primary process helps the GOP. While Trump might be most popular in the party at large, that doesn't decide things. What decides things is the path of victories that begin in the primaries. A small or overlooked candidate who navigates through the primaries can completely smash a more nationally popular candidate.

This is what happened twice in 2008. Clinton was then (like now), the ""inevitable"" Democrat, but Obama made great early primary showings because he ran a great campaign. Similarly, Giuliani was the strongest national candidate for the Republicans, but he neglected the small-state primaries, which gave McCain room to grow enough to win the nomination.

If Trump wins the nomination of the GOP, something has probably gone wrong with the primaries. Jeb Bush and Scott Walker *should* know how to run a state-wide executive campaign pretty well and they can speak on the issues. Trump's *amazing* at TV-driven bombastic crowd-pleasing platitudes, but he completely fails with specifics at the face-to-face level.

The primaries tend to be driven by small local events: The *likely* voters show up and/or pay close attention, and a candidate who flubs on the details can find their campaign crashing to the earth like a popped balloon (""Oops""). 

I don't think Trump can survive that process. He says the media isn't fair to him, but what happens when a regular Republican voter asks him about his tax policy and he has nothing specific to share? What happens when he has no idea who the speaker for the New Hampshire legislature is?

If Trump wins the primary, then it probably means the other candidates have wildly screwed up. The GOP will want to rebuild its nomination process.

But I think winning the primary is Trump's most plausible path to the White House.
***
**The Two-Party System**

The Loyalty Pledge means *nothing*. It's not a law. Trump can promise to support the eventual GOP nominee, lose the nomination, then run as an independent. He'll be called a liar, but this is a man who *bragged about exploiting the bankruptcy code*. Rightly or wrongly, he's more concerned with winning than with honesty.

That said, if he runs independently, he's almost guaranteed to lose. He might have the best numbers among Republicans, but he also has the worst numbers among Republicans - more dislike him than any other major candidate. So he's not likely to draw off enough Republicans to win in a single state. He can draw off just enough to flip a few swing states to the Democrat, however.

His path to victory as an independent effectively requires huge scandals for both the Republican *and* the Democrat. E.G., Jeb Bush is caught with child porn and Hillary Clinton is found to have transmitted state secrets to the Chinese. Either major party getting the nomination without such a scandal having been uncovered beforehand is very unlikely, and Trump would need it to happen to both.
***
**The Electoral College**

Frankly, Trump is the reason why the EC exists. The whole idea behind it was that every state would send its smartest and most civic-minded citizens to a conference, where everyone would come to a consensus about the best man to run the USA. It's pretty idealistic, almost naively so, but when they came up with the idea, everyone knew George Washington was the man for the job anyway.

Despite its idealistic origins, the EC exists to *stop* a demagogue from taking over. Maybe I'm naively optimistic, too, but I think that even if enough states were won by Trump, the electors could be faithless enough to abstain or cast their votes for a more qualified person. There should be enough cheaters to stop Trump from having a majority of the electoral votes. Which takes us to the House.
***
**The House of Representatives**

If no one wins a majority of the EC, the House of Representatives decides. See the election of 1824 for an example. Each state's delegation gets one vote. So CA's 53 House members the same as Wyoming's 1.

This system overwhelmingly favors Republicans. Although they only have 57% of the House by representatives, they have 66% of the delegations; there are 33 states in which they have a majority of Representatives. Democrats only have 14 where they lead, and 3 states have a tie.

So if the election gets this far, it's pretty certain the Republicans pick their own candidate to be President.
***
**First term outlook**

Given all that stuff, Trump's best path to the White House is through the Republican Party. If he actually makes it all the way? Who the hell knows. Any domestic or foreign policies he might *actually* pursue are so obscure as to be effectively random. All we have is blusterous nonsense that will definitely never form the basis of any real policy; there's never going to be a Mexican-American wall, for instance.

So if he wins? Given his style, he probably does something worthy of a bipartisan impeachment within a few months. I hope."
421,TrueAskReddit,Is memorizing things still relevant?,"Sometimes you need a body of facts committed to memory to operate effectively - if it would take too much time to keep looking up a reference each time. Plus, having all the facts in mind simultaneously may allow you to make some cross-correlation that it wouldn't occur to you to look for if you were just considering each fact in turn without necessarily remembering all the others at the same time.

So that's a couple of points in favour of keeping immediately relevant facts in your brain, but not for endless rote memorisation of data. The trick then is to be good at *discerning* relevance, since it's not always obvious what's signal and what's noise."
422,TrueAskReddit,Why is it that the US and Russia have chosen to arm opposing sides in Syria?,"Super simplified answer? Russia is involved because they are allies with the Assad regime. They have a naval base in Syria which is the only real foothold Russia has in the Middle East. The US cares because Iran uses Syria to project power (and to attack Israel via Hezbollah). Neither side wants the risk of true involvement,  supplying arms is the least risky and least costly way to be involved."
423,TrueAskReddit,How do we know that the opinions we hold today are correct?,"No, nobody really knows; you're also bordering on epistemological issues. It's hard to be sure of anything 100%. You can get a rough approximation based on how many people disagree, but that still leaves out the voices of minorities.

It's important to study ethics so that you can put decisions and policies and rules under a microscope. It's important to listen when a group says, ""Ow, you're hurting me."" We don't know if we're doing something secretely wrong, but there are a few responsibilities we have today. One is to question what we do and whether it's ethical. Two is to listen to those that claim that it's unethical. Three is to really just try our best to do good, but acknowledge that there won't be perfect decisions. 

Examples - One person might be a proponent of sending North Korea food and supplies. Another person might be against it because Kim Jon Un will simply sell most of the supplies off and use the funding for his own regime. Neither letting people starve nor funding a dictator are ""good"" decisions, so it's hard to really judge anyone who is making those decisions.

424,TrueAskReddit,How would wartime censorship work in the Information Age?,"Your scenario is not hypothetical: soldiers posting on FB or wearing Fitbit already give valuable information to hackers these days (no need for a wife posting...).

It would be relatively easy for governments to block some adresses nationaly (China does it for Facebook now), filter messages bearing some keywords or force providers to do it for the government.

If it is contested, you can use the ""national security"" excuse (heck, they're doing it now!) and most people would brainlessly applaude.

We're not even in wartime now and big providers are already lobbying for internet censorship, I can only imagine how it would be in wartime... "

426,TrueAskReddit,Why would the Assad regime use chemical weapons if they knew that it would most likely lead to an attack by the United States or other Western powers?,"There are a lot of different theories about who did it. Assuming Assad did it, there are a few possible reasons, even if it would seem illogical and would attract western intervention. Maybe the government was using them in opposition controlled areas to scare the rebels; even if they can be killed by conventional weapons, the psychological effect would be considerable. Even if the regime has won some important battle in the last few months, the situation for them has not improved much, with the opposition being quite strong around the capital. I read about some interesting and plausible theories about Bashar's brother, Maher, who might have used them as some kind of revenge against the rebels, as the result of events that happened last year. Assad regime might have tried to see how determined the US are to enforce that red line. Of course, if you look at the other side, the rebels would have a lot to gain from the use of chemical weapons, and it is a possibility. But even if on the rebel's side are extremists, the Assad regime is brutal, and if it would have something to gain from chemical weapons , it would use them. "
427,TrueAskReddit,What will happen when cheap labor runs out?,"We'd replace cheap labor with automation. If it's not developed in time, manufacturing would just move into first world contries again. The reason manufacturing is outsourced is just because it's cheaper to exploit lower income countries. If there aren't any countries to exploit they'll just build the stuff and suck up the cost. Those people who moved factories made millions or billions, all that would happen is they lose out of profits. It's not like every single factory left the US, just that most went to find cheaper labor to exploit."

429,TrueAskReddit,"Are some emotions ""easier"" for us to feel than others? Is hate easier to feel than compassion, for example?",IMO emotions are like muscle memory. Hate doesn’t come easier than compassion but if you’re conditioned to hate and practice hate it’s going to come easier than love:

There's a growing interest in opioid free recovery (as opposed to substitutes like methadone or suboxone) from everyone from the criminal justice system to drug users and their families.It seems like once people hear about this treatment option they're all for it, but it's not really in the public eye yet. I guess it just takes time to get the information out there."
431,TrueAskReddit,How is it that the two political parties (US) have almost an equal number of people over the past several decades? Wouldn't one party become larger?,"1) The party itself changes. The GOP *was* shrinking until they realized that Democrats alienated people in the south and the GOP exploited the hell out of that, making them explode in size and grab hold of the presidency for like 25 years except a brief Carter term.

2) The political environment changes. Some people are hard left, others hard right. Most are in the middle. For them, what's going on in the world affects what they believe. Gay rights and gay marriage wasn't a party dividing issue before. Nobody liked gay people. It just wasn't talked about at all. Then DOMA happened and now there was a specific thing to fight against. Democrats, at this point being more progressive, started to fight against it, and the GOP fought for it, thereby taking one entire population and putting them almost entirely in one party. Gun rights is another topic that comes and goes in cycles, shifting between parties, and moving voters around.

3) Everything moves in cycles. After the stability of the 50s, there was the radical 60s. A huge counterculture movement. Civil rights at the forefront. The country involved in a horrific war. Peace trying to fight against war. Change can be scary for some people. So those people who didnt care before go to the party that promises to stop that change and bring back stability. Then later, people realize that that stability was built on a lie, a lie that spirals out of control and ruins that false stability and brings about chaos, pushing people to the other party to bring about a different kind of stability."

433,TrueAskReddit,Why isn't there some sort of government sponsored work program in the US?,"The government has funded a ton of infrastructure projects since the recession. They don't directly employ the construction workers. The Federal government gives grants to various state and local governments who then hire contractors to do the work. You can argue about whether that's more or less efficient, but it's not like this isn't already happening."
434,TrueAskReddit,"All else being the same, if women were physically stronger would we have a matriarch-dominant society?","There are plenty of societies throughout history that were ""matriarchal"" despite male and female genetic differences. 

In the Iroquois nations of the (modern) American North East, bloodlines were passed down through the mother, men married into the woman's family, and it was entirely up to the woman whether a divorce should occur. 

While there was still commonly a council of ""wise men"" that aided in the decision making, those ""wise men"" were chosen by the larger counsel of older women. And those women sat in and approved or disapproved of all the decisions made by the men. 

We similar cultural societies in the tribes of the Pacific Northwest as well.

The difference is that under patriarchal societies, the genetic advantages/disadvantages between males and females tends to be used as justification for the ""superiority"" of the patriarchy. Basically: ""What are you going to do about it? I'm stronger than you."""
435,TrueAskReddit,Has social media done more harm or good to society?,"One of my favorite podcasters is Dan Carlin, a radio host turned  political commenter, amateur historian, and amateur journalist. While he's best known for *Hardcore History*, which features many-hour-long, deep-dives on historical areas of great interest, he's also been hosting *Common Sense* for about 14 or 15 years now. 

Something he's said relatively recently on *Common Sense* that's really stuck with me is how terribly difficult it is to judge history when you're in it. Some of the greatest thinkers, political scientists, journalists, politicians, historians, and philosophers have tried to come up with larger themes or ideas about the era in which they lived, and the results are deeply inconsistent and unreliable. 

Even with the benefit of access to highly reliable information and nearly-objective analysis by experts, it's incredibly difficult to determine something about the history we're living, because we're missing the necessary ingredient of perspective. Time and distance grant perspective. 

Applied to your question specifically, we're looking at an emergent technology and social shift which already has made irrevocable marks across hundreds of cultures. Addictive social media which is purpose-built to gather data for the purpose of improving marketing, the immaculate presentation of a curated life for the judgment of others, the increasingly (deliberately) addictive nature of social media technology, algorithmic radicalization for of preferred content for increased engagement leading to radicalized perceptions of the world and beliefs... also unprecedented connectivity, the creation of an entirely different kind of community, great geographical distances between loved ones melting away instantly... ***it's huge***. 

We're not in a position to say, in aggregate, if social media is more harm or more good, and we probably won't be in a place to realistically reach a judgment for decades. I wouldn't trust even people who are emergent experts on social media to make that kind of grand determination. It's too soon to tell."
436,TrueAskReddit,"If we started making things back in the USA they say the prices will go up and not by a few cents, can somebody briefly explain why bringing jobs back to the USA is a bad thing and why prices will rise?","Most redditors don't remember when a pair of athletic socks cost $12, or gasoline was the equivalent of $8/gallon today.  They don't remember a time when you couldn't buy blueberries in January or oranges in July, and fashion consisted of generic (read: boring), American designers. 

The last two generations have been raised on cheap shit from China, India, Indonesia (and before that Japan), and don't have a clue what trade restrictions really entail. Hint: They're not pretty.  

Be careful what you wish for; we may all be making a minimum of $15/hour, but when a burger and fries cost $12 and Argentine beef is no longer imported into the country (or pork exported), regular folks aren't going to like ""Making America Grate Again."" "
437,TrueAskReddit,What are some examples of true moral or intellectual bravery?,"Moral bravery:  *True Nonviolent Protest*, such as that practiced by Gandhi and Martin Luther King.

This is an endlessly misunderstood concept.

Nonviolent protest is not simply a protest in which protesters don't physically aggress. That is, *lack of violence is necessary, but not sufficient, for ""nonviolent protest.""*

**Nonviolent protest:**

- **must be provocative.** If nobody cares, nobody will respond. Gandhi didn't do boring things. He took what (after rigorous self examination) he determined was rightfully his, such as salt from the beaches of his own country, and interrupted the British economy, and *provoked a violent response against himself.*

- **must be *certain* not to justify the violent reactions they receive.** It cannot succeed without rigorous self-examination to make sure you, the protester, are not committing injustice.

- **""hurts, like all fighting hurts.** You will not deal blows, but you will receive them."" (from the movie Gandhi -- [one of my favorite movie scenes of all time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hS1YWtalPY))

- **demands respect by demonstrating respectability.**

- **does not depend on the what the ""enemy"" does** in order to be successful. It depends on the commitment to nonviolence.

A lack of violence is not necessarily nonviolent protest. Nonviolence is a philosophy, not a description of affairs, and in order for it to work, it must be understood and practiced. Since Martin Luther King, few Americans have done either. I suspect part of the reason the authorities often encourage nonviolent protest is that so few citizens know what it really entails. Both non-provocative ""nonviolent"" protests and violent protests allow injustice to continue.

The civil rights protests of the 60s were so effective because of the stark contrast between the innocence of the protesters and the brutality of the state. That is what all nonviolent protest depends upon, and in order to be effective again, protesters must again put themselves at such risk. Protesters must turn up the heat against themselves, while doing nothing unjust (though perhaps illegal) and receiving the blows.

[""If we fight back, we become the vandals and they become the law.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fys2Lvv7VEA) (from the movie Gandhi)

**For example:**

**How to end ""zero tolerance policies"" at schools:**

 If you're an innocent party in a fight, refuse to honor the punishment. This will make them punish you more. But they will have to provide an explanation -- ""because he was attacked, or stood up for someone who was being attacked, etc."" Continue to not honor punishments. Refuse to acknowledge them. If you're suspended, go to school. Make them take action against you. In the meantime, do absolutely *nothing* objectionable. The worse they punish you for -- literally! -- doing nothing, the more ridiculous they will seem. 

They will have to raise the stakes to ridiculous heights, handing out greater and greater punishments, and ultimately it will come down to ""because he didn't obey a punishment he didn't deserve."" The crazier the punishments they hand down, the more attention it will get, and the more support you will get, and the more bad press the administration will get, until it is forced to hand out a proper ruling.

Step 1) Disobey unjust punishments

Step 2) Be absolutely harmless, polite, and rule-abiding otherwise

Step 3) Repeat until media sensation


This is exactly what Gandhi and MLK did, more or less. Nonviolent protests are a lot more than ""declining to aggress"" -- they're active, provocative, and bring shit down on your head. This is how things get changed.

**Intellectual Bravery:**

*The courage it takes to listen well* is a very simple, ordinary, and underrated example of intellectual bravery. It takes courage to risk the possibility of changing your mind, which in a sense changes your identity -- it forces you to ask ""Who would I be if I believed otherwise?"" and come to terms with the answer. There is a sort of death in having your mind changed drastically, or about a big issue, and it is natural to want to defend against the shame of having one's identity ""killed"" with the fervor one might use to defend their physical life. This is what leads to people being impossible to convince of facts, even given the most obvious and substantial evidence. There is a subreddit now dedicated to this phenomenon -- /r/festinger. (full disclosure: I created it)

438,TrueAskReddit,Why are whistleblowers punished by the US government severely for their actions?,"In terms of corporate whistleblowers, there are quite a few safeguards against them being persecuted for their whistleblowing. Government whistleblowers in the news is kind of a different story because they cover material deemed confidential to America, its military, or its security systems. This makes it hard to have some oversight because anyone who looks at what they do needs a clearance. 


Manning was a legitimate security threat. Much of the information he let loose wasn't necessarily that bad, but at the same time some of it was. Sometimes very mundane facts like waste management from a base is kept quiet because it could clue people to what is wasting the material. Yes, you can argue some of the videos showed evidence of wrongdoing on America's part, but to make it so publically available caused more harm than good. 


The NSA scandal was legitimate in my mind because there was no other avenue to let loose what happened. The situation though was not helped though when Snowden went to Russia, which all in all isn't a very good place to go if you want to be a symbol of whistleblowing and government transparency. If there was an actual trial I feel that more would have come out of the scandal. As it stands, we have a criminal in the U.S. eyes that quite a few people believe was justified rather than a policy changer that pulled real change within the government.  "
439,TrueAskReddit,"How do we make topics that are extremely important, but do not connect to people on a visceral level (i.e. campaign finance reform), more accessible for the population? And, what are some of these topics?","How about branding?

Change how politicians are paid: why? (better than 'snore')

Congressional redistricting: snore!

440,TrueAskReddit,"If we were to have the technology to travel interstellar distances easily and quickly, what limitations should we place upon ourselves, if any?","I don't agree with the Prime Directive approach.  I think there would be a great number of instances where we could find a planet that doesn't possess advanced technology, but could use our assistance.  We could provide them with at least some basic medical technologies or food production.  I mean think of what a Star Trek replicator would do for a world going through a famine or even some simple antibiotics during a plague.  These would have to be reviewed on a case by case basis and not simply avoided, because ""they aren't ready"".

On the other hand, we should not take a manifest destiny approach to the universe and start colonizing inhabited planets.  The cultures and species of other planets should be preserved.  "
441,TrueAskReddit,How do I teach my children to be kind to everyone without putting them in danger?,"I think the best thing you can do is have her watch you interact with other people. Whenever you do something particularly kind, take a little time to explain to her why you were kind to another person. It would be important for her to understand the context of kindness. This may help her understand when to be kind and also keep her relatively safe. This won't only help her, but it will help you too :)"
442,TrueAskReddit,What can we do in our everyday lives to improve society?,"I think the distinction between the micro and the macro is kinda invalid. 

In your question, you suggest that progress only comes from mass action. When millions of individuals make a shift in thought and action. You also suggest that this action is 'successful' when it causes companies/governments to act and, implicit in this, that protests, boycotts, and petitions without immediate, tangible results are invalid. Individual action, which has only a negligible impact, is thus also invalid and worthless.

So, let's say we do want to improve society and social change can only come when millions of people have a shift in action and consciousness, how do you get that to happen as an individual?

The answer is that you can't. No one individual can change the minds of millions. All you can do, as an individual, is encourage group action. 

First, let's think what an individual can do in their everyday life. Now, though small actions like recycling or boycotting certain products have no tangible individual impact, it can encourage others to do the same. And once you're encouraging others to act, that's when you start to change society.

 For instance, one of my friends stopped flying long-haul flights because of the environmental impact of the emissions. He wasn't evangelical about it. It was just a decision he took for his own life and he didn't pressure me on the issue at all. But, because of his decision, I thought about the impact of flying. I came to the conclusion that I couldn't justify long-haul flights to myself and decided to avoid them. I can go on holiday to closer destinations. In turn, my decision helped influence my uncle to make the same choice and another friend also. So while the initial friend not flying didn't make too much of a difference, his decision encourage a chain reaction that got other people to make the same decision. 

So, in this lens, the benefit of individual actions (boycotting a company, picking up litter, or - on a more basic level - being kind) isn't limitted to the actions themselves. The aim is to do good things and, by your example and encouragement, get others to make other positive decisions which spreads and spreads and spreads until you have a societal and cultural shift.

That, I believe, is what it means to be the change you want to see in the world. 

You become a beacon for that change and you encourage the world to follow you.

And while you talk about individual petitions and boycotts and protests failing because they don't make achieve their stated objectives, they can succeed in other ways. Namely, in shifting the culture just a little bit. For instance, before gay marriage was legalised, there were countless petitions and protests and boycotts in favour of equal marriage and against homophobia. Not all of these intitiatives had any impact and it took decades of fighting to even make gay marriage a talking point. But, with each social action, society shifted just a little bit towards gay marriage. Even if only one hundred people signed a petition for it, those one hundred might become firmer advocated for it and then encourage their friends to care about the issue even after the petition fails.

**TLDR;** being the change you want to see in the world means acting the way you want everyone to act in the hope that they will start to act a little like you"

445,TrueAskReddit,Is China and America today like Germany and the UK pre WW1?,"You seem to know your stuff! Yes those things are all accurate regarding comparison of the two countries, but the global landscape is different. Russia and France were much more involved in accelerating the war than the UK. China doesn't have powerful military allies, and it doesn't see military dominance as it's primary strength. Neither the US nor China have major hostile powers at their land borders, while in contrast Germany and Russia were obsessed with each other's threat.

Lastly most of these powers wanted the war. The Turks and French were trying to regain land, Russia felt on-the-rise, and Austria was trying to stop its rapid fragmentation. Arguably Germany and the UK were the ones with the least personal stake. While China and the US & friends have disputes, they don't have enough beef to make a war worth it."
446,TrueAskReddit,To what degree do my choices as a consumer determine the level of influence the advertising market has on the spreading of cultural ideas?,"I've accepted there are certain things in the consumer world that I will never be able to change.

I understand that ads and trailers for movies/games/products are out to get my hyped and buy said product. All I can do is buy what I think gives me the best value. Personally I've seen many trends to ""cheap and easily replaceable"" over ""buy it for life"" style products. As a consumer you just have to dig a bit harder to find the thing you want. Most times the best products are the hidden gems that aren't advertised on tv or YouTube. The best way I've found to discover the best product in any category would be to google ""Reddit what's the best hiking boot/frying pan/single player game"" and see what people on here are saying. Any website that has ""10 best -products- you need to try"" is obviously biased and paid to write good things. The only thing we can do is ""vote with your wallet"" and whether or not change comes, at least you made the best decision for yourself."
447,TrueAskReddit,"Why should (or shouldn't) the United States continue to ""police"" the world?","My background is in political science and economics, so I'm going to approach this from an international relations angle rather than an ethical or justice perspective.

Excluding the new millennium, the last several centuries of European politics revolved around one central premise: *balance of power*. Remember, that this was long before peace was the norm, before international courts, coordination sanctions, and our modern definitions of what a [casus belli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casus_belli) was, so the risk of a powerful nearby nation simply annexing you was much higher.

**The last few centuries**

Balance of power was so important that nations would sometimes declare war on one another with the primary purpose of reducing the neighbouring nation's power, as opposed to a specific strategic goal like territory or resources. Probably the most notable example includes the War of Spanish Succession (to prevent a future personal union between Spain, the largest overseas empire uniting with France, which possessed the largest European land army). Arguably the Quadruple and Quintuple Alliances' wars against could also be interpreted this way as well, though Napoleon was a much more direct and existential threat.

To an extent this was also the primary reason the Allies declared war on Germany. They annexed the Saarland, re-occupied the Rhineland, annexed Austria, Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia... Germany was growing too large for other European powers to keep in check, to the extent war was considered the best option. That's how important the balance of power was. And then after the war, we had a similar state of affairs with the Soviets and the United States restricting one another in the Cold War.

**The Hegemon**

Now towards the end of the cold war as the Soviet Union became increasingly unstable, there were growing fears among theorists that for the first major time in history, there would no longer be a balance among the superpowers; America would become the first (and possibly last, given their power) global hegemon.

Then the Soviet Union fell and... well, nothing really happened. There was no takeover, no strong-arming of the international community to bend it to America's will (at least, not with the nations that mattered -- the largest national powers besides America). Maybe America just too politically fatigued to start another cold war, this time with Europe. Maybe decades of working together against a threat created a camaraderie that prevent them from turning hostile against Europe. Or maybe with nuclear arsenals at play, America knew it would be worse off if it abused its position too much. Maybe a combination of these.

The fact is, things arguably became better. No existential threats to the largest nations meant no arms race, which meant no exorbitant military having to constantly create newer generations of nuclear missiles and their platforms. Conventional weapons were still being developed, but in a manner more like ""having it just in case"" rather than ""HOLY CRAP, LOOK AT THEIR NEW TOY. SHIT, WE GOTTA MAKE ONE EVEN BETTER BEFORE THEY USE IT TO STEAMROLL US"".

As people came to realize America had no real interest in dominating the international community (again, just among the most powerful states), the old balance of power theory was probably for the first time in (European) written history no longer dictating international relations, and the idea of a hegemon was no longer considered an existential threat.

**Hegemonic Stability Theory**

So political scientists put together the Hegemonic Stability Theory, which basically states that a hegemon acts as a positive force in international relations. (There are various schools and interpretations of why exactly this is, but I won't bore you with the nuances). 

With the rise of China, and it's aggressive claim-pushing against Tibet, Taiwan, the Indian border zones, and the South China Seas -- and the consequent destabilization and arms build up this has caused in the region, I think it should be self-evident that having a single global hegemon was a good thing (i.e., before the rise of China as a superpower). Likewise, with Trump growing distant from NATO, the European Union has also taken steps towards military reforms to make it a more capable fighting force against Russian aggression.

And for those worried about abuse of power by the hegemon? I think their concerns are exaggerated. Nuclear weapons equalize the balance of power, which is why every tin-pot dictator wants them so they can stand up to the ""big boy"" nations in the playground. And even in the absence of nuclear weapons, human organization shown that populations of hundreds of millions already push modern bureaucracy and cultural tension to its straining point. There's no way you could ever get 8 billion people under direct rule. (And indirect rule, as has been shown in the European empires and ancient China alike, leads to rebellious vassals). Finally, a hegemon has no incentive to abuse its position very much. A hegemon is too unstable (it needs the cooperation of others to exist), and is already the dominant power in the world, so won't gain much more by outright conquering or exploiting it.

**TLDR**

Hegemons reduce international tension, drastically reduce military spending, and armed conflict between states. A great analogy: in nations where only police have weapons are generally safer on average than nations where everyone has guns (Afghanistan, America, etc)."

What is the nature of this form of satisfaction? What is the explanation for its existence?","This is being in ""the zone,"" it happens in athletics as well.  I don't think this ability is universal, but I am unsure as to whether it is something that is learned, innate, or combination of the two.  I have experienced this in my work (I'm a scientist) and as a dancer, and it is indeed an amazing feeling.  I can have this feeling when writing as well. 

Here are the ingredients to starting a ""zone"" session for me: I need to be well-rested, have enough caffeine (but not too much), have enough to eat (but not too much), well-hydrated, generally relaxed and able put other anxieties out of my mind, and -- most importantly -- be well integrated into the work.  I can't just pick something up after not doing it for a while and get there, no matter how well prepared I am.   It also really helps to do any of this later in the day for me, that is serious ""zone"" time.

I set myself up to be in a ""zone"" to take the GRE and it really worked.  I studied every day for a two weeks before that, but took the day itself off.  I just made sure I had a lovely, relaxing day.  I took a time in the evening to take the exam.

You could be liberal in matters of governance. Each would have carried a distinct preference for freedom in these specific realms. They aligned to various degrees in various revolutionaries, and they came into force with the Enlightenment in Europe as the political force that certainly changed the world.

Conservatism will always exist, because there's always someone with entrenched interests in keeping things the same, and people with justifiable concern at where things are headed.

The fact that Liberalism in its original form has been so wildly successful that now our Conservatives in America use it as a deep conviction of their philosophy proves that Conservatism doesn't change. They're still all about keeping the status quo, but that status quo does move along an axis, dragged by the successful changes that arise to oppose it. A belief in the Divine Right of Kings in France today is beyond absurd, but they still have ""Conservative"" parties (which at their worst now they'd be more obsessed with conserving the Français de souche than the roi, a decidedly more populist message... but still a little old-timey for my tastes.)

People who hold to the original Liberal Agenda have had to coin a new term, Libertarian, or else call themselves ""Classically Liberal"" because we let the word Liberal denote the opponent to Conservatism back when Conservatism was conserving an absolute monarchy. Liberals supported a constitutional monarchy. Then they supported a Republic. On and on the term has stuck.

The term Liberal was certainly clearer back when Liberals were opposing the Tsars, but in the western world it's long been influenced by later ideologies about governance like theories of Social Welfare. Conservatives all around the world have invariably coopted the victories of these ""liberals"", incorporated them into their idea of what should be conserved, and usually don't question it.

Now in Britain, I think, Liberal still holds the ""classically liberal"" connotation. In France they understood me when I used the word liberal, but then America broadcasts all of its political discussions abroad and people are quite well informed on the terminology I've found (more informed than I've ever been on the status of European governance, though I've gotten more politically aware as I've gotten older and would like to think I'm making up for last time drooling over foreign elections and conflicts).

In America, generally, everyone knows what you mean when you say liberal, and only the most tediously pedantic person would say the term hasn't changed since it's inception (looking at you *literally* crusaders). So a liberal is a liberal. Is there a shade of difference in meaning from Democrat? Absolutely. Democrat is a strictly party term, wouldn't you say? Liberal, at least in the American system, can orient on a spectrum (I'm less liberal than Senator X, one might say, or such a state is more liberal than New Hampshire). But honestly its use aligns you more to the American political spectrum than it does the theoretical Left-Right spectrum, because economically the parties are quite close compared to the antagonistic parliaments of Europe where Communists rub shoulders with Classical Liberals. Obviously the American political parties have also switched sides, on the issue of Conservatism anyway, as it was the Republicans who arose to challenge the Conservative Democrats, this time on the issue of Slavery rather than Kingship (well, every man a King and every Black man 3/5ths of a serf.) 

Since the Southern Strategy days, it's been the Democrats we call Liberal and the Republicans we call Conservative.

Now the term Progressive, has always struck me as a better term for those people who wish to ""forward"" society in challenge to Conservatism. It has that positive, even dare I say propaganda-esque quality to it, and Conservatives have tried to demonize the term in America which means they've obviously noticed that. (Glenn Beck, as usual, provides funny foaming-at-the-mouth rants against ""progressives"" especially, but I know self-styled Conservatives who wouldn't share a room with Beck so let's not paint too bad picture here.)

Naturally society isn't a linear progression towards lofty capitalized ""Progress"" much as it may seem that way with technology and wealth sprouting up like weeds in the past century.

For instance, drug policy has been all over the place. During [The Great Binge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Binge) attitudes towards drugs were what we could now call rather Progressive (I mean, actually they were just totally out of control, but if Progress is towards the liberalisation ((that is freedom)) of drug use, then one has to admit you could get whatever you liked back then, easy). Societal pressures suppressed and suppressed drugs, with varying levels of severity. It's not necessarily out of conserving a society from before drugs, since you could say it was an attempt to improve (progress) society. Nowadays, drugs being a very different game, the discussion is difficult to describe as some linear progress.

But then this is the problem. Words are weaselly worms and they just sort of do what they do and we've got to hope we can follow along."
451,TrueAskReddit,What's wrong with being offended?,"Human beings are social creatures. Offending someone perturbs social structures. Their offense is an alarm which signals to you that something may be wrong. But like ""check engine"" lights, sometimes the alarm itself is faulty.

If you repeat an action/statement and repeatedly you receive negative feedback, then you have to seriously ask yourself if what you are doing/saying is detrimental to the relationships that surround you. If it sufficiently deteriorates relationships, then your own social structure might begin to dissolve.

But imagine no one told you they were offended. Then you would carry on as you always have, hurting and alienating those around you until you end up alone.

Life is compromise. I don't make dead baby jokes around mothers who have had still births, and they don't rant about how prisoners are lazy slobs who deserve to be there. 

Being a little offended can even be fun, but if you don't respect those around you to a reasonable degree, you'll find yourself a highly detested human being. At that point, you're the problem, not them."

453,TrueAskReddit,Should the right to a healthy environment be added to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?,"No, and here's why: The UNIVERSAL declaration of Human Rights has to be a basic, kind of minimum standard for the world to uphold. 

Firstly because if we started to expand the UDHR into things like healthcare or education, then all of a sudden, nations that are not in positions to provide these are suddenly violators of human rights. 

It's a concept of negative vs positive rights. Think of universal human rights as a floor and not a ceiling. Negative rights are rights that I can give to you just by leaving you alone, i.e torture, enslavement, killing. Positive rights are ones that the state would then have to provide (food, healthcare, work) at someone's cost. 

Because it's ""Universal"" it must be basic enough to apply to all cultures. Some scholars believe that the UDHR is another white-western mode of influence on the world. Adding anything to it would only further that notion.  "

457,TrueAskReddit,"What would society be like if voters' votes were weighted to the tax rate they paid, which they could set themselves?","It's certainly an interesting concept, but the simple fact is that it would make things so, so much worse. The poor can only handle so much taxation and often consider their tax returns indispensable, so they'd have little incentive to make their votes count for much, if at all.

Meanwhile, the rich can afford to make their votes as influential as they like. But they wouldn't even have to bother, because bribery is legal. So they, too, would choose criminally low taxation rates and the money they're not spending on taxes would find its way into politician's bank accounts rather than into the governments coffers where, some of it at least, would benefit the population as a whole.

So you'd have lower voter participation and lose out on a ton of tax revenue. And, of course, the wealthy would ensure that no legislation that could fix this problem would ever pass even if it meant that some of them had to take a hit for the team and pay exorbitant tax rates to ensure sympathetic lawmakers got into office."
458,TrueAskReddit,Why doesn't Trump appoint Ben Carson as Surgeon General?,"I'll try to de-politicize this as much as possible, and it can only be conjecture regardless, but the way I see it is: HUD, though a minor cabinet position, is still higher status than Surgeon General. Carson isn't qualified to do anything other than be an amazing brain surgeon- he's proven himself to be a textbook idiot-savant; he's also been one of Trump's biggest supporters, and he's black. HUD is a low-key racist appointment because Trump thinks that Carson's ethnicity will appease black anger while he continues and accelerates our country's policies of ambivalence and abandonment of poor people, and specifically minorities. HUD's mission statement is: ""to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all. HUD is working to strengthen the housing market to bolster the economy and protect consumers; meet the need for quality affordable rental homes; utilize housing as a platform for improving quality of life; build inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination; and transform the way HUD does business."" Does any of that sound like things Trump gives a shit about? He was the defendant in high profile housing discrimination lawsuits. He is literally the guy that HUD exists to protect people from. Carson is filling this role because he'll do whatever Trump tells him to do, and he'll feel good about it because he's a Secretary of something."

462,TrueAskReddit,"Why is ""mate"" used as an informal pronoun for a friend in the UK and Australia, but is essentially non-existent in the American dialect?","The colonisation of the two continents took place several centuries apart. Further, America received immigrants from a much wider range of sources, particularly German and French. Australia, on the other hand, was entirely governed by the British and saw very little in the way of immigration from the other European powers. Finally, there wasn't much of a push for a distinct ""Australian identity"" until the dissolution of the British Empire itself, whereas the generations following the American revolution were very keen on establishing their own identity separate from the homeland.

As a result, Australian dialects are much closer to the British source than American ones, and share a lot more in terms of slang, idioms, and other grammatical oddities."
463,TrueAskReddit,In what ways will Millennials be better off than their parents' generation?,"Information.  I screwed up so many things because I didn't have the information I needed or I wasn't able to get advice from an experienced person.  So many simple things that now would easily be resolved with a quick internet search.  For example, my first year in university I overloaded my schedule because I thought that's what you were supposed to do, then I didn't go to any ""tutorials"" because I thought those were for failing students (which I therefore became).  I lived off campus and made my life more difficult because I heard by word of mouth that dorm living meant sharing a small room with 3 other people, no private bathroom and still cost 3x what rent was.  So many stupid decisions based on limited and faulty information.

That's just one event.  Stuff like tenant rights, how to cook or repair things, banking, transit schedules, comparing prices, all were a matter of individual trial and error.  If you didn't have helpful parents and mentors, you started out life at the bottom of a abyss and would fall over and over as you tried to climb your way out.

470,TrueAskReddit,Is vegetarianism a worthwhile pursuit?,"I grew up eating meat for pretty much every meal of every day. If there was no steak, chicken breast or chunky beef spaghetti sauce with my lunch or dinner it didn't ""count"" and I felt like I wasn't getting a full meal. So switching to a vegetarian diet has been pretty tough. A few things I've found that help: 

1. Don't call yourself a vegetarian. I've found that title to come with a whole lot of assumptions that are not necessarily true. You're a vegetarian? You must hate hunting. You don't eat meat? You must be a yoga-loving hippie. You're not changing who you are and you're not subscribing to a lifestyle. You're just making a more conscious decision about what you eat based on the impact your eating habits have on your body and the planet. 

2. Meat is delicious and there's no reason to cut it out of your diet completely. Nowadays I consider meat products a treat, like cake. I wouldn't eat cake every day, but I'm not going to feel bad if I have it every once in a while or on special occasions. This makes it easier at parties, functions, etc. when you have little choice anyway. Food is to be shared and enjoyed, so don't force yourself into being the guy eating celery sticks all night.

3. Don't buy meat. If it's not in your fridge, you'll eat less of it. If you eat out, get the vegetarian dish - it's usually good and encourages the owners to provide such options. Plus you get that instant feeling that you're voting with your money. Avoid fast food like the plague it is (of course, you should be doing this anyway).

4. Don't preach. Talk about your choices and rationale if people are interested, but accept their decisions. Dismissing or belittling people for eating meat is unproductive. The person that just spent hours making that roast is not going to appreciate you calling it a ""chemical-ridden carcass"" and someone chewing a delicious steak will hardly think twice about how the animal was treated. 

5. Your rationale (whatever it ends up being) will only get you so far. Make your diet a habit and you'll stick to it. Your body will approve and your mind will eventually catch up.

Best of luck."
471,TrueAskReddit,Does comprehensive sex education provide age appropriate education? Why does it seem to work better than abstinence only education?,"So, I teach sex education. I also live on a relatively  small island with a population of 85,000. 
I'm passionate about honest, open and factual sex and relationship education. I teach about consent, communication, abuse, pornography, sti's, pregnancy, self respect among other topics.
I've taught through three pregnancies, and have brought my babies into classes. My kids have been held and cuddled by ALOT of teenagers. Some people think it will 'encourage them to have babies' but actually statistics show (from the data we collect as a charity)  that teen pregnancy has reduced in the last seven years since we started the program.
I always answer a question honestly, and I really believe that the kids respect that. 
I don't agree with teaching young people abstinence, I think that teaches them to ignore their bodies wants and desires. Rather than to embrace them, listen to them, respect them and act on them safely and in a positive way.

EU is utterly irrelevant apart from being a source of bonus points for making it seem like NK is willing to negotiate. UN could be an avenue that EU could back, but the security council is utterly crippled in this matter by China and Russia (and possibly the US at this point too).

South Korea should always be the first and foremost channel in any negotiations with NK because they have obviously the most on the line, and also there are at least some possible signs that the relationship between the Koreas is warming up."
473,TrueAskReddit,"When do dreams ""register"" in consciousness?

I remember having a dream where I was observing someone walking through my house, up the stairs, and into my room, then yelling my name at the exact time that someone was actually saying my name. I believe the earlier part of the dream was retroactively placed into memory/conscious experience to rationalize the actual event. 

It also seems that leg/muscle jerks that happen are caused not by having a dream (and experience) of falling or stumbling, but it's the other way around - the muscles jerk, then the brain feels the body move and invents a short dream sequence to 'explain' it, including by creating a conscious experience that appears to occur before the physical event itself.

476,TrueAskReddit,What jobs *can't* be automated?,"At the risk of sounding like I am trying to be meta, the job of automating things is pretty hard to automate.  

For example, I write code to help automate things office workers may do manually.  Many of them appreciate it, because I help remove the tedium from their jobs, and they are often so overworked as is.  Anytime they don't have to compile TPS reports and make Excel graphs and send email notifications, they are usually pretty thrilled.  You don't have to fully automate their jobs: many tasks are better performed by a person (for now and the foreseeable future).  You just have to allow them to focus on the important things.  In the current state of affairs, this is the ideal level of automation.

In order to automate something, you need many technical pieces in place (access to data, feeds, APIs, etc).  But that gets you nothing if you do not understand what it is that the people do.  I don't think you can currently automate ""understanding"".

AI could prove me wrong here.  But I think that's the heart of the question, really: how far will AI progress?"
477,TrueAskReddit,"Could China, The US, or Russia nuke a non-nuclear country and get away with it?","I guess it depends on what “get away with it” means.  I’m not an expert on nuclear policy of any of the nuclear powers, but I’m familiar with the broad outlines of their publicly-disclosed nuclear policies.  Those policies address conflicts with near-peers or occasions where other states use nukes first.

My speculation is that a country like the US, Russia, or China could use nuclear weapons against a country that no other nuclear powers is really invested in without there being a nuclear retaliation.  For instance the US could nuke Kabul or Russia/China could nuke Ulaanbaatar without a nuclear retaliation.

I definitely think their would be punitive measures enacted by the rest of the international community against whatever state used nuclear weapons without being under extreme duress (or having an ally under extreme distress).

I can’t see any reasonable situation for a nuclear state to use nukes against a non-nuclear state except some kind of corner case, and even then I don’t think it would be likely."

481,TrueAskReddit,Should the British Monarchy die when Elizabeth does?,"As an American I don't see that it's really a pressing concern. The Monarch's powers are all but symbolic anymore and while theoretically the sovereign could exercise some power it would likely end with them deposed anyways. The current state of affairs is rather enviable, actually. You have the benefit of a proportional representative plural democracy and the advantage of a conservative head of state in one. Even if your King or Queen cannot exert actual power they still act in a capacity of advisement to different governments, liberal and conservative, and advise them not on specific actions but rather to keep the interests of the people in mind.

Contrast that with our American system where our Head of State is elected and whose opinions and stances are governed not by the best interest of the people as a whole but of the people who elected them. We lack a head of state-as-catetaker that I see in your Monarch and her Governors General in the Commonwealth Nations. Elizabeth wasnt elected and she's enjoyed enormous privelge and wealth in her lifetime by the random blessing of birth but she was also raised with the belief that she is Britain, that what's best for the nation is best for her. I guarantee you Trump doesn't think about his job in those terms. 

This is all on top of the fact that the royals don't cost you, their subject and taxpayers, any money and infact generate revenue for the nation. This is in addition to the public good will they generate with philanthropic giving and organizing, their military service, and their global diplomatic outreach.

482,TrueAskReddit,At what point does Karate or other forms of martial arts actually become useful in combat?,"Most martial arts teach the same basic things.  The biggest thing that separates them is training methodology, which goes hand-in-hand with how grounded that style is in reality.  Doing kata for ten years won't help much in a fight, but rigorous and regular sparring for two months will have a huge impact on someone going in with no experience.  While it's not impossible for kata man to be a badass fighter, chances are his training regime has prepared him to do kata really well as opposed to actual fighting.

I feel that grappling styles are better as far as getting someone more dangerous in as short a time as possible.  Until the fairly recent surge of interest in MMA, you rarely saw anyone performing takedowns, maintaining position, or submissions in media.  Within a couple of months the average joe can learn the basics of groundfighting, which is streets ahead of average non-martial-artist-joe.

That's not to say that striking styles aren't efficient or useful, but they require more time investment to gain a significant edge over non-martial-artist-joe since everyone more or less understands that moving a fist fast into the other person's face hurts them.

Again, though, the biggest thing is training methodology.   If the school isn't doing regular hard sparring, then it's not preparing its students for combat (at least as quickly and efficiently as possible).

tldr:  Spar more, get more dangerous faster."

Join neighborhood (not community... we're talking about people on the same street as you) organizations.  Let your neighbors borrow your tools, or better yet, help them with their projects.  Trade recipes and garden plants with the old ladies down the street.

Of course, accessing the internet mentally wouldn't necessarily up our neural processing speed, so in a sense it might still be about who's the most intelligent, who has better processing skills, etc. The other thing is choice. If I can't remember who the President of Bolivia is is it immediately piped in to me or do I have the choice to remain in the dark? In the former case I expect the experience would be overwhelming for most to the point of a mental breakdown.

486,TrueAskReddit,What are the verifiable advantages and disadvantages to being a vegetarian?,"**Advantages:**

* A vegetarian diet *can* be healthier.  Sure, you can be a vegetarian and eat nothing but cake, Coke, french fries, and salads slathered in dressing, but in general *any* restriction placed on a person's normal diet will result in fewer calories consumed.  Vegetarians also tend to steer clear of fast food and many calorie-rich restuarant meals.  A true vegan diet is even more restrictive, and it eliminates many processed foods.  A strict vegan won't even be able to consume wine (may be filtered through eggs or fish parts) or white sugar (processed with bone char).  So just the process of restricting a diet tends to result in more conscious food choices and less consumption overall.

* A vegetarian diet *can* be more environmentally friendly.  Raising animals for meat is a major contributor to pollution, greenhouse gases, water waste and the depletion of fertilizers. Producing a single meal containing meat may take dozens or even hundreds more resources than producing a vegetarian meal.

* The demand for extremely cheap meat has created an industrial agriculture system that's inhumane for animals, abusive towards workers, and dangerous for consumers.  Health and safety regulations have been weakened.  Environmental regulations have been weakened.  It's very possible to humanely raise and slaughter animals for meat, but not at current prices and levels of consumption.

* Some research suggests that carcinogenic compounds are produced when meat is cooked.  It's also possible that meat is contaminated by the high levels of antibiotics and steroids used in modern agriculture.  Are these levels of contaminants and carcionogens significant when consumed as part of a normal diet?  Probably not, but research is still being done.

* Some animals are pretty damned cute.


**Disadvantages:**

* Limited selection of prepared food.  If you like to cook and have the time to do it, it's easy to make healthy, tasty vegetarian food.  If you like to eat at restaurants, or if you like to buy prepared food... well, you're going to have a lot fewer choices.  If you're a vegan, you'd better like to cook, because there are animal products in fucking *everything,"" even in products made for vegetarians.  Because of this limited selection of prepared, prepackaged food, vegetarianism and veganism can be expensive and inconvenient lifestyles.  Many vegetarians end up eating an excess of high-carbohydrate, fattening foods.  It all depends on what you like to eat and how much time you want to devote to your diet.

* It's easy for a vegetarian with a varied, healthy diet to get all the nutrients they need.  You don't even need to take vitamins.  But a hardcore vegan will have a significantly harder time getting a nutritionally complete diet unless they put sincere research into it.

* If you start shopping at specialty vegetarian/vegan/organic/natural grocery stores and restaurants, you're going to be bombarbed with ads for ""natural products"" and health fads of questionable safety, efficacy and quality.  Sooner or later, some hippie will try to convince you that you need an ayurvedic colon cleanse and aromatherapy bath products and magical antioxidant berries.  You need very good bullshit filters, or you'll end up spending a whole lot of money on crap you don't need that isn't even good for you.  Vegetarians seem to be even more gullible than the general population, if natural food stores are any indication.

* You run the risk of becoming *that* obnoxious vegetarian.  The one who can't go out to eat with friends without giving them a lecture on their food choices.  The one who makes the whole family watch a video about pig slaughter right before Grandma cuts the Christmas ham.  The one who talks incessantly about how clean their digestive system is now that they're eating nothing but juice and lentils.  Don't be that guy.

Disclaimer: I am a carnivore, but I limit my meat intake because of concerns about agricultural practices and health effects (and also because I'm a bad cook and I don't like touching raw meat).  My mother and sister are strict vegans for ethical reasons (they just can't imagine eating cute animals)."
487,TrueAskReddit,How Can We People Attempt To Change The Education System In America?,"Edit: sad I got downvoted for an honest answer?

I'm a teacher and honestly it is tough. TOUGH.

**Small Scale**

The problem is real ""changers"" are often disliked. Further, most teachers have to go into some type of leadership in order to really make changes in their schools, and that is hard. I'm currently finishing up my admin now, and I cannot say I really want to do it.

If you are not a teacher, and especially if you are a parent, stay involved. Even when your kids get older! Go to the dumb fundraiser or art show. Ask teachers how you can support them.

The most amazing things ever done for me were actually from parents. Teachers need to do their part reaching out to parents, but parents need to, too.

If you are not a parent...vote. And do not just vote for your party. Look at the issues and what they really mean.

Do not freak out about raises in taxes for education because it is usually .00 something of a cent. You probably would not even notice.

**Large Scale**

On a larger scale, America needs a complete turnaround. We are failing our kids, yes. But honestly, I believe it is partly because schools are now raising kids - not educating them.

Teachers have become parents in many ways. When did this happen? Why did we allow this?

How can a student take a teacher seriously when they view their teachers as basically babysitters?

It is so much deeper though. I could write a book.

Honestly, ask me anything. 10 years, one of the poorest parts of America."

After 30, you probably have a life of your own. A wife, kids, a house, work, friends, hobbies... And more maturity around life and death. Your entire life doesn't resolve around your parents, so the experience is not as traumatic as it can be in childhood. But it still hurts. For me, the worst moment was not the death, but the funeral. Uncontrollable crying and emotional pain like I've never experienced before, for about 5 very long minutes. I think my brain blanked out, because I was told I did some things I have no memory of. But in my case... I still had my kids to take care of, so it grounded me pretty quickly. Kids, work, chores... Life mostly got back to normal. But the pain of losing my father was still there, sometimes. Alone in my bed at night. In the shower. While driving. For no particular reasons I'd remember that I couldn't talk to my father anymore.

&#x200B;

5 years later, I still get emotional thinking about him. In my case I don't know if it will ever completely go away. I can't avoid crying in movies when a paternal figure dies. The movie doesn't even have to be that good. I still cry when I go to funerals, even if I don't know the deceased, because I still remember my loss.

I still lead a wonderful life. I think he'd be proud. But sometimes, like now... I'm reminded that I still wished he could hug me.

He posits that it be placed alongside food, water, and shelter in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. And I tend to agree with him. 

If you've ever felt slighted or rejected, you know the pain it causes. In the linked video, David Rock says that psychological pain and physical pain light up the same areas of your brain, suggesting that your body feels psychological pain in the same way it does physical. He even says that taking a physical painkiller (I believe he cites ibuprofen) can reduce psychological pain. Pretty neat stuff.

Jealousy is the feeling you get when something is taken away from you. (Envy, on the other hand, is when you want something someone else has. There's a slight but significant difference between the two.) When that something is a person, it represents a significant blow to your social positioning -- you have been deemed *lesser* than the person who replaces you; you are no longer significant. 

More than this, I think it's worth considering that people identify with their lovers and spouses: that person makes up part of who you are in a remarkably short amount of time (I wish I could cite the study that found this out; it was years ago that I came across it). So to lose a lover to someone else means not only are you getting knocked down a peg, you're losing part of yourself. Jealousy then acts as a self-preservation method.

If the religion were a specific sect of a larger religion, then, slowly, members of other sects may - *may* - drift slowly into the true faith over the next 100-300 years. This is because all faiths already consider themselves to be true and proven.

If the true religion were henotheistic, literally nothing would change, because henotheism holds that one god is ""most correct"", but that all other gods are also correct - just not for your particular social group.

500,AskHistorians,"Dolly Parton had a famous song ""9 to 5"", yet every full time job I have had is 8 to 5. Did people work one hour less in the 80s? How did we lose that hour?","**Were the most common hours in 1980 really from 9 am to 5 pm?**

9-to-5 was a catchphrase by that time. It had been a catchphrase for a very long time. It did not even represent an ""average"" job when the phrase was first coined.

Furthermore, the 9-to-5 phrase was introduced back when a six day workweek was common. So it wasn't even representing a 40-hour workweek, but a 48-hour one.

...

Let's start by jumping back a bit to the 1890s.

The average work-day for men was 10.2 hours a day and women 9.2 hours a day, out of a six-day workweek.

For men, the bottom decile worked an average of 10 hours a day while only the top decile made it to 8 hours a day. The top decile men got to start at 8 rather than 7 am, and took lunch for an hour rather than a half hour. Even the 70th-80th decile had an average of 10 hours a day.

In 1892, Massachusetts passed a law *limiting* the hours-per-week for women to 58 hours. So while the concept of an 8-hour workday was already around (most famously in 1886 where hundreds of thousands of workers went on strike to demand an 8-hour workday, and many got it) it was often not a thing in practice.

...

The earliest reference I've found regarding 9-to-5 used as the phrase is from 1918:

[1918](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Trans_communicator/swI1AQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=9+to+5+job&pg=PA910&printsec=frontcover)

>Coe, when he returns from his vacation, will find he has graduated from the night force to a 9 to 5 job with the day regulars.

Let's follow up a bit through the years:

[1926, interviews with women who write](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Earning_a_Living_by_the_Pen/hK0OAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)

>You can't make a 9 to 5 job out of it and really get anywhere. And it's not a snap job. But the work is absolutely fascinating...

(For reference, the above quote is roughly when work started to change from six to five days a week, but it wasn't instant or universal.)

[1931](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Advertising_and_Selling/UzPmAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)

>You will be helping to lick ""the winter of our discontent"" -- and maybe fitting your wife for a 9-to-5 job should she ever need it.

>It is far from a 9-to-5 job, but it is a real challenge, and as law students are truly wonderful people...

[1949](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Program/V1AFAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)

>For five years he got up early enough to practice a couple of hours before the 9 to 5 job, practiced in the evenings, studied until 2 or 3 in the morning.

>We know that we have a great responsibility when speaking to people who risk freedom and even life when they listen to us. We know ours can never be a 9-to-5 job from which one goes home and forgets.

>His is no 9-to-5 job. Too much is at stake; the lifetime dreams of those he serves.

>Nursing does not appear to be all that was promised in the classroom. They feel inefficient, and long for a nice tidy '9 to 5 job' in an office or elsewhere.

Observations:

- There was a vague sense of 9-to-5 as a ""women's work"" stable job -- finding your wife a 9-to-5 -- but it wasn't universal; the phrase was more nebulous and could include both men and women.

- 9 to 5 was ""low responsibility, low stakes""; you could ""go home and forget"".

- 9 to 5 was ""nice and tidy"".

My general point is that the exact hours of 9-to-5 were picked up as a catchphase *very early*.

The first quote is notable because it involves railroad workers. Railroads are where much of the early 8-hour day push happened. The Adamson Act of 1916 -- only two years earlier -- established an 8-hour workday for a certain subset of railway workers, and other workers soon demanded the same. Here's another quote from the same section:

>Bros. Martin, Lee, Umbaugh, Howard, and Lynch are still on the 12-hour grind. However, relief has been promised ... When these brothers first made heir request for an 8-hour day, before joining the O.R.T., it was almost ignored. Since their committee strolled down to see the boss man a new man is now posting on the job, with the promise to line up more extra men as soon as they can be secured, thus giving the boys their ""eight-hour day"".

(Also, notably, early railroads are the *only* instance I have been able to find where 9 am to 5 pm are regularly the actual exact hours; it is possible they were even the origin of the phrase, but there isn't enough evidence to tell.)

9-to-5 certainly did not describe a typical job. It described, in some sense, an *ideal* job.

I can find no point in the history of work where it was ""the most common"". For example, in 1937, in the District of Columbia, 2,892 women who worked in department stores were surveyed about their working hours. Only 7 worked 40 hours exactly and only 15 worked 48 hours exactly. Overwhelmingly, the most common number of hours was exactly 45 (9 hours a day for 5 days a week).

I unfortunately haven't been able to find any survey of an exact start time for 1980, a survey from 1991 gave 8 to 5 as the most common hours, and the general data on hours indicate very little change between the two. So, in summary: there is no missing hour: as a catchphrase that dated back more than hundred years; even though such hours have existed in the past and even still exist today, the phrase ""9-to-5 job"" hasn't meant the actual hours of 9 am to 5 pm for a very long time.

501,AskHistorians,Michael Phelps beat a 2000 year old Olympic record set by Leonidas of Rhodes in 152 B.C for the most Olympic wins ever. Are there any other ancient Olympic records that have remained unbroken?,"I wouldn't be surprised if there are more swimming events that Phelps competes in than ancient events as a whole. There were three fighting events: boxing, wrestling, and pankration (a combination of the two, maybe a bit like MMA). Two riding events: chariot and horeseracing. Four different running events (including the race in armor), and the pentathalon. So I think it is a *bit* unfair to Leonidas.

The one that comes to mind is Phayllos of Kroton, who leapt so far he cleared the pit and broke his leg. As the pit was about fifteen meters long, this is well beyond the 8.9 Mike Powell managed in Barcelona. That being said, the sheer size of this leap has made plenty of people a bit leery, and it does seem to be straining against the limits of the possible, and so there is a bit of a debate over what the long jump was actually like. One possibility is that the weighted [halteres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halteres_(ancient_Greece\)) that the athletes apparently held while jumping was used in some way to add lift or effect the center of gravity, but modern testing hasn't really provided a comparable effect. The simpler explanation is that it was just a triple jump, which makes 15 meters extremely impressive but well within the 18.3 meters that is the current record.

If you want to read more, Leuven has a great little site about the Olympics, I linked [Phyllos' page](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/tp018en.html).

EDIT: it is worth noting that event athletics became proffessionalized to an extent during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. There were enough places hosting games that it was possible for a talented athlete to make a comfortable living going from Games to Games and surviving off of the prize money. By contrast the competitors of the classical games were young aristocratic amateurs, so I find it pretty likely that the quality of competition was much higher in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, but authors primarily primarily talked about the classical games."

504,AskHistorians,"In the netflix series “The Crown”, S2:E8 shows John F. Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy’s visit to Buckingham Palace. In it, they portray JFK as abusive to his wife, and both him and Jackie getting administered drug cocktails before important dinners or visits. Was this true?","It's well established now that Mr. Kennedy had a, if you will, *boatload* of health problems for which he was heavily medicated and used adaptive technology to counteract. Official health records and Mr. Kennedy's medical staff confirm this, in particular his debilitating back pain. Biographers have even described a power struggle among physicians treating the president over whether more exercise or continued painkiller injections was the better option for treatment. (Spoiler alert: physical therapy).

Likewise, Arthur Schlesinger's (relatively) recently released interviews with Mrs. Kennedy affirm that on Inauguration Day, she took Dexadrine between the inauguration ceremony and the evening ball to get through it.

So the question is really whether Mr. Kennedy's medical-treatment drug useage extended to ""drugs to lift you up for the event and bring you down gently afterwards"", and whether Mrs. Kennedy repeated her use of an amphetamine.

The difficulty for historians is that the attention here focuses on a shady celebrity doctor named Max Jacobson, who based his treatment program, reputation, and not coincidentally income on a cocktail drug injection based around amphetamines and painkiller. The vast majority of the evidence for Mr. Kennedy's ""off track betting"" use of drugs comes from Jacobson's unpublished biography; he (of course) destroyed his medical records. (And not just drugs adminstered by Jacobson--he tells one anecdote of Mrs. Kennedy discovering Demerol in their bathroom and her asking *him* to convince her husband not to take it). Furthermore, Jacobson was never on the White House medical staff and does not appear among counts of official entourages for various state visits abroad.

Journalist and professor Richard Reeves (*President Kennedy: Profile of Power*) seems to be one of the few writers on the Kennedys who has actually bothered to investigate the possible veracity of Jacobson's claim. Here is the evidence he gathered:

* The FBI file for Jacobson asserts that Mr. Kennedy was listed as one of his patients by the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
* Jacobson visited the White House 30+ times from 1961-1962 (in late '62-'63, Mr. Kennedy's official medical staff headed by George Burkley cracked down on his more freewheeling medical treatment preferences, so the timing fits)
* For a presidential trip to Vienna, Dr. and Mrs. Jacobson are listed in White House documents as booked into a room in the entourage hotel
* A memo from Mrs. Kennedy's social secretary notes Dr. Max Jacobson coming to visit *her*--although I'll note that could easily refer to a discussion about her husband's health rather than her own (see the Demerol story above, for example)

The Kennedy presidency was incredibly carefully stage-managed, above all by Mrs. Kennedy herself. (Who was also no slouch in the political arena, recent historiography has begun to reveal.) Sealed records, destroyed records, stigma against people with disabilities, and the eternal popularity of conspiracy theories about/involving/by/against the Kennedys complicate our ability to get a crystal clear picture. However, the evidence suggests that there was a relationship between Jacobson and the Kennedys, and it seems a fair presumption that between Jacobson and Mr. Kennedy at least it was a doctor-patient one.

As to domestic violence, I can only say that (20 year rule applied) the historiography on spousal abuse and U.S. presidents/first ladies is *extremely* sparse. Almost unbelievably so. Rumors circulated that Grover Cleveland's ""boorish"" behavior extended to battery of his wife Frances; she went on public record denying them and affirming that their marriage was basically perfect. Rachel (Mrs. Andrew) Jackson survived an abusive marriage before marrying the future president. I caution that this is referring to physical abuse rather than verbal or emotional. No, I don't think that's the whole story even with the limitations, but scholarship on first ladies is still young and largely hagiographical/biographical. I suspect this is a ""stay tuned"" topic for the future."
505,AskHistorians,"In the sitcom Married... with Children, protagonist Al Bundy is able to support himself, his homemaker wife, and two children on the income he earns as a shoe salesman in a strip mall in the suburbs of Chicago. Was this at all realistic for the late 1980s/early 1990s?","Wow! I can finally provide some help with a question on /r/AskHistorians as a lawyer who does some labor, employment, and wage work, and as a big fan of the show. I can at least give some background on what we know about the show and about the wages Al earned while joking with Griff and [taking jabs at the rotund customers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRCHBi0DRFg&t=126s)

Let's rock:

Some basics on this for those who don't know: The show ran from 1987 to 1997 on Fox, and was (along with The Simpsons) the first hit for the fledgling network.

First, the income analysis. We can look at this in two ways: How much did shoe salesmen earn around that time, and how much Al Bundy actually earned.

We actually know a great deal about how much Al earned. Al earned a base salary plus commission at the store. We know from ""My Mom, the Mom"" (S03E12) Al earns that way, because he states he earns a 10% commission on each sale. I would say this really tells us how great of a salesman he is, considering how many customers he can insult and still earn those bonuses. 

Even better, we actually know Al's base salary! In ['Tis Time to Smell the Roses, S07E23](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0642200/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl), Al is offered ""a year's salary"" for an early retirement. How much? $12,000. At 40 hours a week that breaks down to about $5.77/hour. Or $231/week. Of course, Peg spent Al's retirement bonus in a single day, as she is known to do, and Al returned to work the very next day. :-(

How realistic was that for retail employees in general during that time? I found data from [1993 Chicago](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924071730059&view=image&seq=238), showing that retail clerks at that time had a mean weekly salary of $278. So, when you add in Al's commissions, it seems entirely realistic!

Just to add in general: The minimum wage of Illinois in 1991 increased to $4.25/hour. So, again, Al's compensation on the show is very realistic. Jefferson approves!

Now, the matter of the family living arrangements. We know that the Bundy family lives in a ""Chicago suburb"". The actual exterior shot of the Bundy house is taken from [641 Castlewood Ln, in Deerfield, Illinois](https://www.complex.com/style/2014/09/the-real-world-locations-of-iconic-tv-homes/married-with-children). That home sold in 1998, a year after the show went off the air, for $320,000. What's more, we know from 1990 Census data that average home costs for Deerfield, Illinois, were between $1400-$1500 per month for homeowners with a mortgage. So, unless scoring 4 touchdowns in a single game at Polk High came with a big cash bonus (and BTW that fact is extremely relevant at all times), Al wasn't mortgaging a home in Deerfield (using 30% monthly income as the ""affordability"" figure like most banks).

Uh oh. Not looking good we would realistically see The Dodge parked in that driveway. Historical home values from the county clerk's office suggest that was not a huge sudden increase, either. 

So we know Al couldn't swing that particular house, but what about in general? The median home price in 1990 Illinois was $80,100 based on the 1990 Census. But Al didn't BUY the house in 1990. He bought the house sometime before 1987. 

Assuming Kelly was a child and Bud was a toddler when they bought the house, which would make sense, they could have purchased it around 1980. In 1980, the average home price in Illinois was $50,004, again using [Census data from 1980](https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/census/historic/values.html). [Freddie Mac data](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html) says the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 13.74% that year (oof). That makes the mortgage payment $466, figuring Al scraped up a 20% down payment. We can reasonably estimate $500 with taxes and insurance.

So now, in terms of a median home price and the Bundy family's likely situation, the show makes some sense. In 1987-1997, Al would maybe be able to ""afford"" that median house he purchased in 1980, as in, make payments, but (especially if he drove most customers away with his fat jokes, and had less commission), it would be a real struggle. The struggle often portrayed by Al's frustration on the show. And why shouldn't he be frustrated? All he wants is to sit on the couch and possibly read the occasional issue of Big Uns (or potentially the special issue with 120 pages - that's 240 ""Uns""!).

Pointedly, then, the show's realisticness in terms of their home and arrangements might depend on whether Al drew any income as the founder and President of the National Organization of Men Against Amazonian Masterhood.

Further reading? Kelly says reading is for girls who aren't hot. Instead, I suggest watching the show, which is available on Hulu. Grandmaster B approves."
506,AskHistorians,"The physician in the autopsy of Charles II gave some very... colorful (if not medically impossible) descriptions like ""heart the size of a peppercorn"" and ""did not contain a single drop of blood."" What was going on in these autopsies?","Piggybacking off this a bit, how long after his death was the autopsy performed? As that may well affect the coroner's observations. Imagine, for instance, if Charles II laid in state for a period of time after his death without any embalming (I don't know what the Spanish monarchy's customs were in this respect), that would give a decent amount of time for all those lovely bacteria inside of us to start going to town on his innards. 

I think I remember, for instance, that (yes, this was a few centuries prior) William the Conqueror wasn't embalmed before his funeral procession and got tremendously bloated as a result, so I'm curious if that might be what happened to Charles II."
507,AskHistorians,"The Chemical Weapons Convention (1993) has prohibited the use of tear gas in warfare, but explicitly allows its use in riot control. What is the logic behind it being too bad for war, but perfectly acceptable for use against civilians?","This is a question of obvious contemporary political importance so I will endeavor to answer it cautiously and with respect to the emotions it no doubt raises.

The logic here is best found in some of the signatory nations’ legal interpretations and internal Law of Armed Conflict manuals,[neatly summarized by the Red Cross here. ](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule75). The Dutch manual of 2005, for instance, tells us the following:

>Riot control agents such as tear gas may not be used as a method of warfare (Chemical Weapons Convention Article 1). Use as a means of maintaining order, including the control of internal unrest, is not prohibited. Military use must be distinguished from this. **This conceals the danger that the use of a relatively harmless chemical may unleash the use of some other, more lethal one by the adversary**...\[M\]ilitary use of a non-lethal weapon may pose the danger that the adversary perceives it as a forbidden means, which may induce the adversary to use other, more lethal means. One example is the use of tear gas, mentioned above.

Chemical weapons pose particular problems on the battlefield as weapons of mass destruction. In the case of tear gas and other riot control agents, which do not pose major concerns in terms of environmental persistence, excessive painfulness, persistence of pain after the victim is removed from exposure to the gas, and potential for permanent injury, the problem posed is one of *escalation.* Consider two armies locked in combat, let’s call them Red and Blue. Each side is a signatory to the same chemical weapons treaties, each side has a robust no-first-use policy, but each side has a stockpile of lethal chemical weapons including nerve agents as a deterrent to the enemy’s use of chemical weapons. Neither side adheres to the 1993 rule on riot agents. A low-level Blue commander, Major Indigo, is having a hell of a time getting a Red battalion off an important hill. Major Indigo requests permission to fire tear gas onto the hill to dislodge the Red forces. It’s an important hill, taking it could turn the tide of battle, and so his boss Colonel Cyan authorizes it. Meanwhile, the Red forces under Major Crimson are taking no chances. They’ve been sweating in their gas masks and chemical suits all day, just in case. The call comes down the line - *gas, gas, gas!* \- and Red’s soldiers hunker down nervously, safe but uneasy in their protective gear. None of them are exposed, so it’s hard to tell immediately just *what* chemical they got hit with. Major Crimson calls *his* boss, General Ruby. General Ruby knows **one** thing: when weapons of mass destruction are in play, you *have to* maintain the credibility of your deterrence. Blue has to be shown immediately that use of chemical weapons will not go unpunished. With staff academy lectures on “escalation dominance” echoing in the back of his mind, General Ruby signs the paperwork authorizing a limited but punishing chemical weapon retaliation. Three short-ranged ballistic missiles loaded with nerve gas are fired at Blue’s position. Colonel Cyan, Major Indigo and their subalterns die a horrific, gasping death. An hour later, as Blue’s *own* bombers and missiles loaded with mustard and VX begin to launch, the battlefield lab analysis lands on General Ruby’s desk. Just tear gas.

The above scenario seems perhaps melodramatic or overwrought, but it highlights the stakes involved with weapons of mass destruction and the *extreme* consequences of incomplete information. The presence of nonlethal chemical agents on the battlefield creates a risk far out of proportion to the actual severity of the weapons themselves.

As for sourcing, in addition to the link given above, my perspective on deterrence, escalation risks, and the consequences for uncautious behavior with WMDs is heavily informed by Larsen and Karchtner’s *On Limited Nuclear War in the 21st Century* and the opinions on so-called “battlefield” nuclear weapons expressed by Michael Kofman in several of his CSIS presentations. These both do not directly connect to chemical weapons, but many of the concepts of deterrence are similar across categories of WMD; there is simply more literature on nuclear weapons than chemical.

EDIT FOR SOURCING: Savoy, Sagan, and Wirtz’s 2000 *Planning the Unthinkable: How New Powers Will Use Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Weapons* was also at the back of my mind when I was chewing on this question.

OBLIGATORY MORNING-AFTER EDIT: Folks, please stop giving me gold. I appreciate the gesture, but giving money to reddit is probably the least useful thing you could be doing with that money. There are a massive number of nonprofits that need that money *far* more than reddit does. Reddit has a profitable ad revenue stream, and more importantly, reddit has spent the last decade platforming and giving shelter to white supremacist groups.

509,AskHistorians,"Nixon won re-election in 1972 with the widest popular vote margin in American history, and consistently led in Gallup polling by wide margins in the months leading up to the election. If his re-election bid was expected to be a walk in the park, why did he break the law to undermine the Democrats?","Gosh, what a great question! It's such a great question, in fact, that **there is no definitive answer to it.** (Maybe you can be the person who [trawls the Nixon tapes](http://nixontapes.org/) and finds the answer.)

Before I start the discussion, it might be worth pointing out something that you (well, maybe not *you* in particular /u/TrynnaFindaBalance, but *you* collectively, as in everyone reading this) might have overlooked.

What's obvious to us today, with the benefit of hindsight, was not clear to Nixon or anyone else in the United States in early 1972. We know the results, and so we have an artificial assurance that because things turned out they way they did, they *must* have turned out that way. Living in the moment is to live in uncertainty.

At the start of 1972, opinion polls showed Nixon and the various Democratic contenders in a close contest. [Sen. Edmund Muskie was considered a strong candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/31/archives/nixon-and-muskie-nearly-even-at-43-and-42-in-gallup-poll.html), and Nixon feared facing Alabama Gov. George Wallace (who was ultimately incapacitated in a May 1972 assassination attempt). 

At the start of the year, when G. Gordon Liddy and Attorney General John Mitchell discussed the campaign to harass and sabotage the Democratic Party, Nixon's wide victory wasn't yet apparent. That would come later.

It's also important to remember that the June break-in — for which Gonzales, Barker, McCord, Martinez, and Sturgis became infamous — was only part of the campaign approved by Nixon's backers (including Liddy). That campaign also included wiretapping and other kinds of snooping. **Remember that Nixon himself may not have been aware of the exact activities: It was the coverup that got him in trouble.**

But that doesn't get to your key question: ""What were the burglars after?""

There are *a ton* of fun theories about this. The most popular theory is that Nixon believed that Democratic National Committee chairman Lawrence O'Brien had some dirt on a loan given by billionaire Howard Hughes (yes, of Spruce Goose and ""The Aviator"" fame) to Nixon in 1969. Some of that money, [according to reporting by ""60 Minutes,""](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watergate-aviator-connection/) went to paying for frills at Nixon's Key Biscayne home.

[E. Howard Hunt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ex-spy-crafted-watergate-other-schemes/2012/05/31/gJQAh80uFV_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d90adae4247e), who hired the burglars, told the *Miami Herald* in 1997 that they were actually looking for ties between the Democratic National Committee and foreign governments. They were searching for evidence of foreign campaign contributions (something that might be familiar to Americans lately), which would make great dirt in the election that year.

“What we were looking for is the same thing every congressional committee is looking for today, which was evidence of illegal foreign contributions,” he told *Herald*. “That was the rationale for going in there. We’d heard rumors that both the Vietnamese and Fidel Castro were inserting funds illegally into the Democratic National Committee. And the idea was to look at the books, photograph them, in and out, and that’s it. It didn’t seem like such a deal to me. You know, I’d been doing that stuff for years, a ‘black-bag job’ into other embassies. But you know, I didn’t have skilled people.”

In 2001, [Liddy testified that the burglars weren't after anything political](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/30/us/g-gordon-liddy-gives-first-testimony-on-watergate-break-in.html): They were actually looking for photographs that put the wife of White House counsel John Dean into a call-girl ring. 

Contemporaneous rumors held that the motive behind the burglary was to find evidence held by the Democrats that linked Nixon to various assassination attempts made by the United States against Fidel Castro. A lot of those rumors stemmed from the fact that the Watergate burglars had deep ties to anti-Castro plotters, and some Americans reveled in the idea that the nation's dirty tricks had come home to roost.

[Columnist George Will has an interesting theory](https://www.nationalreview.com/2014/08/reason-watergate-george-will/) that ties the motive to events happening in the days surrounding the burglary. One year before the break-in, the *New York Times* began publishing the Pentagon Papers. Will has suggested that Nixon was worried that the Papers would expose Nixon's 1968 role in sabotaging peace talks related to the Vietnam War. Nixon's successful sabotage of those talks, revealed only in the past few years, violated the Logan Act of 1799. 

Regardless of the motive, it seems likely that Nixon himself had no particular knowledge of the June break-in, but he did know broadly about a campaign of ""dirty tricks"" against the Democratic Party to hamper Democrats' efforts to fight him in 1972. And as I said before, it wasn't the break-in that ultimately forced Nixon to resign: It was the cover-up. 

That's something worth remembering."
510,AskHistorians,"The Statue of Liberty is now green, but it used to be copper. While the statue was forming its patina, were there people calling for its restoration to the natural copper? How did people come to accept it as green?","Best that I can find, there wasn't much call for this. A *little*, which I'll touch on, but it seems to have been quite muted. Even by the time that the statue had arrived in the US, it had shifted from the red-brown copper it had shown off in Paris to a pure brown as the patination had begun (Thanks to /u/ducatimechanic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8w6pie/the_statue_of_liberty_is_now_green_but_it_used_to/e1u0s6v/), this is a [guide](https://i.imgur.com/35o8587.gif) to visualize the change). It was fully expected that patination would occur, and for that matter, *important* that it would. Although Bartholdi apparently had hoped it would end up in a bronzed color, the statue staying its natural copper would be awful for it, structurally, and in restoration work that has happened, it has been important not to disturb the patina, because it is a layer of protection against the elements, which helps prevent further corrosion. Removing it, or worse, maintaining a continual cleaning schedule to prevent it at all, would just mean the copper would just continue to deteriorate away! This was of great concern in the '80s when a massive restoration effort was underway, especially when a cleaner being used on the interior seeped out and started to dissolve the patina in places, which workers had to quickly work to stop. 

Checking through what literature I can find, the real issue concerning restoration has always been focused around who pays for it. The Statue of Liberty proved to be a somewhat awkward gift that left the US Government in a quandary, unsure quite what to do with it, and as such it fell into an administrative quagmire of competing jurisdictions. The National Lighthouse Board, the US Army, and the American Committee (the group which had fund-raised for the pedestal and operated ferries to visit), for various reasons, all had some level of responsibility, but also all insisted that the other groups were the ones who should be maintaining it. A 1890 bill was defeated in Congress that would have made is a public park maintained by the Federal government, and it wasn't until another decade had passed that Congress agreed to a small one time expenditure of $62,800, which was enough to do some interior painting and install the elevator, but hardly enough to anything more substantial, or long-lasting. 

Now, to be sure, there was a good deal of public concern about this, and a number of newspapers, starting within a few years of the statue's arrival, decried this, but it doesn't seem to be about the color. As already noted, the patina plays an important role in preservation, and the only articles I could find from the time which makes reference to any calls to strip the patina are focused on explaining why it would be a bad idea! There were *some* people saying it should happen, but one author, writing in 1910, makes it fairly clear it was a proposal that was ignored:

>The patina is the rust on bronze, which, however, does not, like the rust on iron, corrode the metal. It is green in color, the exact shade depending on the amount of alloy used with the copper to form the bronze. It is formed by the statue gathering from the atmosphere carbon and sulpher, and in the formation of nitrate copper crystals on the surface.

>""In the case of the Statue of Liberty on Bedloe's Island"" said Mr. [Gutzon] Borglum, ""the continuous washing of the wain and the spray keeps it clean. I should have gone to Washington, if necessary, if the proposal to take away its patina had been likely to be adopted a year or so ago. People said then that it was eating into the metal, and that in certain placed the bronze was rent away. All I can say is, if there are any thin places they are the result of flaws in the original casting.""

So again, as this suggests, there was clearly *some people* calling for the patina to be stripped, but from the start, experts were making clear that it was not needed, and a bad idea. An earlier article, from 1903, is even further in praise of the green, noting that of burgeoning hue at that point:

>Kindly nature has been spinning for her a fine cobwebby outer raiment or verdanlique, deeper in one place, lighter in another. Snows and stinging hail, fogs and rainstorms have been gently removing the repulsive newness of her bronze and streaking cheek and uplifted arm, draperies and crown with tender shades or green such as the cleverest bronze rounders try to produce with chemicals on their new 'castings, but never quite succeed in simulating.

The author further warns against any voices which might ""*shriek wildly for scrubbing brush and Putz-powder""*, not just for the writer's aesthetic tastes, but also again for the protective covering the patina offers. The editorial also calls for the appointment of a 'keeper of public monuments', specifically to ensure ignorance doesn't result in the destruction of monuments, not just 'Lady Liberty', a position which seems to have at least somewhat come about by 1910, as that seems to be the role Gutzon Borglum was assisting in by then. Additionally, as before, this suggests the existence of those who desired a de-greening, but again that despite their existence, it was a call which experts pushed back against.

One related thing I did find, which I would also make mention of, was a call not for a stripping down to the natural copper color, but instead to paint it! An article in 1906 makes mention of such a proposal, and again the author instead favors the ""marvelous harmony of blended colors"" from the ""varying shades of light green, delicate white, and a subtle dash of yellow"" which by that point have almost entirely overtaken the bronzed hues. The proposal had been written up in several papers, but at least as presented in this article, but was clearly not in an advanced stage of planning. Capt. George Burnell, in command on the island for the War Department, mentioned to the author the ""bushels of letters"", almost all of which were aghast at the proposal - which additionally helps to point to the acceptance of the green quite quickly - and additionally talks to copper experts who find the idea not only unnecessary, but quite ludicrous. Unfortunately I was unable to find the original announcement, but it is certainly clear enough that it all came to naught.

Anyways though, to continue with this more general over view of restoration, during the Wilson Administration, a Public-Private partnership with the *World* newspaper saw another $30,000 from the government, but again, it was a one time expenditure, and this time for installing flood-lights. Lights which, lacking maintenance funds, had mostly ceased working by 1930.

This funding morass continued through the 1930s, when it finally was moved to the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, as part of a larger push under the FDR administration, in step with the New Deal, to give 'Lady Liberty' her due as a symbol of the country. Unable to get the funds solely on its own, between 1937 and 1941 the NPS worked in conjunction with the PWA and WPA to give the statue its first real overhaul, a $1.5 million dollar makeover which involved clearing the entire island of buildings to start fresh, building a seawall, a new dock, walkways, and most importantly much needed maintenance of the internal iron structure - although not quite extensive enough - which was becoming quite rusted at points, thanks to the salty seawater surrounding it. Much was done, but of course the outbreak of war in late 1941 brought it to a halt. Work would resume again in 1946 to wrap up work unfinished in '41, but over the next decade or so, the real focus with funding was on the creation of an American Museum of Immigration, which would eventually open in 1972 after a long and fraught 'battle'.

By 1981, even the work done by the NPS decades earlier was showing its age, and spurred by an analysis by French architects, a renewed focus on a *thorough* overhaul of the statue, especially in light of the upcoming centennial, began to be planned, perhaps most famously with American Express donating a penny for every purchase made with their card to the endeavor, resulting in $1.7 million dollars. Closed to the public in 1984 for the work - and as noted above, careful not to disturb the green! - the work was completed in time for the ""Liberty Weekend"" centennial celebration in 1986, with President Reagan turning on the floodlights the night of July 3rd, and the statue officially reopened on the 5th.

511,AskHistorians,"The United States was founded, populated and developed by people who were not originally from America. How did anti-immigration sentiment arise from a literal nation of immigrants? How did the idea of America as a melting pot of different cultures develop in spite anti-immigrant sentiment?","I cannot answer your first question, but I can provide insights on the second.

The idea that America was built on multiculturalism appeared very early. By the 1780s, the term ""melting together"" was a widespread metaphor in use that was meant to positively portray incoming immigrants. Of course, America had just ousted a foreign power from their backs, so nationalism was running high.  Hamilton, an immigrant from  Nevis, argued vehemently against immigration, arguing that immigrants brought pro-monarchy and ethnic views that would undermine their new, fragile country. He also argued that America's bountiful resources and exploding population meant that America didn't need to rely on newcomers. From the Hamilton Papers,  Examination Number VIII, Jan 12th, 1802:

*In the infancy of the country, with a boundless waste to people, it was politic to give a facility to naturalization; but our situation is now changed. It appears from the last census, that we have increased about one third in ten years; after allowing for what we have gained from abroad, it will be quite apparent that the natural progress of our own population is sufficiently rapid for strength, security and settlement.*

At first, the two dominant parties of the time (Federalists and Democratic-Republicans) mostly agreed on keeping out immigrants. Thomas Jefferson wrote in his *Notes on the State of Virginia* in 1781 that foreigners would be anti-Democracy. However, by the turn of the 19th century, the Democratic-Republicans viewed pro-immigration policies as a great way to undermine the Federalists.

See, Hamilton and the Federalists were afraid of the French, who were at the time being led by Napoleon after the bloody French Revolution. Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans pursued pro-French policy—and more proactive foreign relations with other countries—which included immigration. Jefferson saw immigrants as future voters for the Democratic-Republican party. As with many of these social issues, divisions in public opinion came from the very top, so voters tended to side with their party's views. So pro-immigration stances tended to saturate more educated Democratic-Republicans. The election of 1800 was a particularly nasty affair, as the battle lines between both sides slung serious vitriol to get their candidates elected. John Adams, the Federalist incumbent, faced off a challenge against Jefferson. Adams was pro-class and cultural hierarchy, while Jefferson wanted to model the country's Democracy on the new post-revolution French model.

It should be pointed out that both Adams and Jefferson saw the 1800 election as a fight over America's soul—that the election would set in stone the standards for how America would treat the subject of immigration for the rest of time. Jefferson would later write: *The revolution of 1800... was as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of '76 was in its form.*

Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican allies would use the melting together metaphor extensively in their campaigning, making 1800 probably the biggest pivot on pro-immigrant sentiment for the general public as self-identified D-R party members adopted Jefferson's messages.

Finally, the D-R party wasn't free from bias, and fought internally (and extensively) over what type of immigration was considered acceptable by them:

*The meaning of the recently popularized concept of the melting pot was subject to ongoing debate which centered on the issue of immigration. The debate surrounding the concept of the melting pot centered on how immigration impacted American society and on how immigrants should be approached. The melting pot was equated with either the acculturation of the total assimilation of European immigrants, and the debate centered on the differences between these two ways of approaching immigration: 'Was the idea to melt down the immigrants and then pour the resulting, formless liquid into the preexisting cultural and social molds modeled on Anglo-Protestants like Henry Ford and Woodrow Wilson, or was the idea instead that everyone, Mayflower descendants and Sicilians, Ashkenazi and Slovaks, would act chemically upon each other so that all would be changed, and a new compound would emerge?* (Baofu, 21-22)

The term ""melting together,"" and other various close iterations of the same idea, was solidified in the public's vernacular as ""melting pot"" in 1908, when the play *The Melting Pot* by Israel Zangwill was released and became popular.

Edit: Thank you for correctly pointing out that Hamilton was from  Nevis, not Puerto Rico.

512,AskHistorians,"I'm a medieval toddler having dinner with my family. Do I refuse to eat peas and throw my spoon like my modern contemporaries, or are the terrible twos and tantrums a modern phenomenon as some would suggest?","Great question! Unfortunately (or fortunately), it straddles different topics, eras, and historiography which makes it an adventure to answer and difficult to give you a single answer. This doesn't mean it can't be done, but in the spirit of Ask Historians, an answer about the layers of history in your question. And then an attempt at an answer.

First, there's the matter of what we can infer from children’s behavior centuries ago based on what adults put down in writing and which writing endured. There’s the use of your word “toddler” which is a fairly modernish term (usage dates to the late 1700) that describes a human in a particular stage of development distinct from previous or subsequent stages; and this notion of distinct stages has its own history. Then there's the specificity in your question around the “terrible twos” which is a very short window of time in a human’s life about which an adult may or may not write. (I feel comfortable saying two-year-olds medieval toddlers weren't keeping food and behavior journals.) Finally, there’s how the adults around the child constructed boundaries for behaviors and how they vary in terms of what’s considered an inappropriate tantrum or an appropriate expression of independence. These boundaries are shaped by a society’s – be it modern or medieval – thinking about gender, disability status, race, religion, class, the nature of childhood itself, the expectation of children, and in the case of your question, dietary habits. 

It's helpful to spend a bit more time thinking about one of the challenges in your question: your precision. It's a great detail, but alas, it makes it a bit harder to answer as a historian of the medieval era can probably shed some light on the eating habits of toddlers but likely won’t be able to explicitly say “yes, this thing happened” because the adults who wrote about children wouldn’t have used your level of precision. 

I often experience similar tensions in American education history, I can rattle off anecdotes I've come across from teacher journals from the mid-1800s where a child is described as misbehaving (her words), but the child’s age is often not noted (“the youngest Smith boy”) or is described in the context of when they attended school (“winter session.”) However, I also know that her journal writing is informed by the social pressure she experienced related to how well she did her job. So, it's difficult to know for sure if what she's describing as ""misbehavior"" was the sort of thing children did because they're children or truly something dangerous or harmful. And to complicate it, the same teacher might write home that the same child was an absolute hellion to her but through sheer force of will and motherly instincts, she was able to calm him down and teach him his letters. And of by the way, if the school board was interested in buying new books for the school, she knows this particular boy simply loves to read. Which is to say, she's a bit of an unreliable narrator with regards to the things children in her charge did. So, if you asked, ""have 7-year-old boys always hated school?"" I couldn't say for sure. I could tell you there are instances of teachers reporting boys around age 7 or so did not like doing the thing they asked them to do. 

Although related in historiography and themes to the history of education, there is a separate branch of historians who study the history of childhood and youth. It's their work that can help us understand the imprecision regarding age I described above is not a universal trait. As an example, Berner (2014) looked at the rituals in the lives of Ashkenazic Jews in the 1700s and could describe down to particular years how children were treated because a child's age played a role in the rituals of the community. From her 2014 article: ""very young infants were often brought to the synagogue, bringing toddlers and children under the age of three or five was usually discouraged."" So it's possible a historian of Ashkenazic Jewish childhood could speculate how two-year-olds might have responded to food they disliked, but it's difficult for us to extrapolate from one community to the broad category of human two-year-olds across an entire extended era. 

Finally, there's the issue of taste. That is, this idea we wouldn't eat something - or allow a toddler to pick and choose - because of the taste or flavor has its own complicated history that I dipped my toe in and promptly turned around. Perhaps a food historian can chime in on the history of food for toddlers - but again, it would difficult for us to extrapolate from taste to behavior to patterns over time. 

That said, I'm going to go out on a limb and say no. To be sure, historians can look at the historical record and reach different conclusions. It happens routinely and is, in truth, one of my favorite parts of ""doing"" history. So, it's entirely possible someone is writing another post in which they say, ""yes, and here's what leads me to that conclusion."" I, however, am going to say no, and here's why.

It's very possible that a two-year-old in 1066, when faced when a spoon full of food, offered a very strong opinion that indicated they did not want to eat that food, thank you very much. And given what we know about universalities of human development, it's very likely they did. However, the heart of your question is how the adults responded, not what the child did. The very notion of a tantrum is a fairly modern - 20th century - concept. That is, the idea of toddler expressing their opinion strongly and vocally in response to a request for an adult deserves its own name (""tantrum"") emerged from the idea that there is ""typical"" child behavior - or normal and abnormal behavior that needs to be redressed. 

I wrote about the field of Child Study in response to the question, ""[What is the history behind ""What is your favorite color?""](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hng4kq/what_is_the_history_behind_what_is_your_favorite/)"" and the movement's impact can be seen in your question, and in fact, the curiosity behind your question. In effect, they asked the same thing you're asking: why do small humans do these things that big humans don't? The founder of the movement, a man named G. Stanley Hall, was fascinated by this idea that the attributes of childhood could be observed and studied in the same way scientists studied the natural world. This isn't to say adults before the Hall came along in the late 1800s weren't curious about children's motivations - or had opinions - but rather, Hall created structures that gave rise to developmental psychology, child psychiatry, and societies for Mental Hygiene focused on children's behavior. 

While adults in previous eras would and could describe children's behavior on a continuum or scale in relation to their siblings or other children, what Hall and his contemporaries did was related to scale and norming. They collected thousands of anecdotes about children, detailing everything toddlers did and wrote about patterns. The field of child psychology encouraged doctors and parents to frame children's behaviors as good or bad, healthy or unhealthy. Kathleen Jones 1999 book, *Taming the troublesome child: American families, child guidance, and the limits of psychiatric authority.* goes into more detail about how this history evolved and explores how the theories behind a child's ""tantrum"" ran the gauntlet from ""their mother gave them too much attention as a baby"" to ""their mother didn't give them enough attention as a baby."" Public health, especially child health, was a very popular social issue in the early 1900s and doctors around the warned of disastrous events if a child's bad behavior weren't fixed. Thus, tantrums became something to be handled and fixed, rather than something children did. 

Which is to say, did medieval toddlers strongly and vocally express their opinions about food? Probably. Did parents see such opinions as abnormal behavior that needed to be handled? Likely not.

513,AskHistorians,Where are all the Native American restaurants? Was such a thing ever popular in the US?,To add on this if I'm allowed... what is an example of native American food. I know it likely varied by region. We all know the stereotypes of plain dwellers eating buffalo and the early settlers learning how to grow corn from the local natives. But does anyone know if there is any native cuisine? 
514,AskHistorians,How did humans cope with poor eyesight in the Middle Ages? Did all hunters and knights thus have 20/20 vision?,"There's no question that the prevalence of myopia (nearsightedness) was much lower in the Middle Ages than today. No, we have absolutely nothing even remotely resembling statistics, and just because in the past century or several there's been a noticeable increase in myopia doesn't itself say anything about medieval western Europe (what I'll be talking about here). However, medieval popular Christianity relied on *visuality* in some pretty basic ways I'm not sure it would have if 50% of some such of people couldn't see their own shoes. ""Art is the book of the illiterate"" was a basic philosophy of religious instruction. Church sculpture, mosaic, decorated rood screens, stained glass were meant to glorify God but also to instruct (hence the popularity of Last Judgment scenes over the tympanum). And watching the priest consume the Eucharist (bread and wine) could substitute for the person doing it themselves--even in the case of a saint like Nicholas von Flue.

But we also know that some people were indeed nearsighted, and obviously eyesight deteriorated in various ways (presbyopia/farsightedness, AMD, cataracts, etc) with ageing. I want to briefly introduce a distinction that scholars of disability and medicine make between ""impairment"" and ""disability."" Impairment *in this sense* is used as a deviation from the normative (not from the normal! lots of things are normal); disability refers to when an impairment affects someone's functioning in the world. Here, I'm going to talk more on managing visual impairment to minimize (not necessarily eliminate) disability.


This being the Middle Ages, obviously the first way people tried to cope was by praying for miracles. And indeed, miracle stories attached to saints and shrines offer some really interesting cases of the extreme end of visual impairment that's ""not quite blindness,"" although we should keep in mind that ""blind"" is a subjective term that means different things in different contexts.

Two important themes that arise from miracle stories are the effect on mobility and on ability to work. One of St. Elisabeth of Hungary's miracles concerns a girl who, it's clear, has some vision but only a little; the story emphasizes that she can't even see well enough to find her way on a path. (Medieval ""roads"" could just be a trampled line through fields). There's a similar miracle concerning a middle-aged man who developed possibly cataracts (*macula*, stains) and similarly couldn't find his way on a path; he reported being ridiculed for it. 

In these cases, the key was to lean on the support of other people. We read a lot about blind and otherwise visually impaired people being ""led"" to shrines. That's probably the single most common theme in anecdotes of people with disabilities in the Middle Ages--the ad hoc, case-by-case reliance on friends and family, or in a few cases monastic charity.

With respect to work, it seems that in a lot of cases the key was to find a task a person could perform. The miracles of St. Bertin tell of one evidently nearsighted man who couldn't see well enough to perform outdoor manual labor, but up very close could still see well enough to do needlework. So he sat with the women of the duke's household all day, working on embroidery and weaving!

The later Middle Ages did have knowledge of and practice rudimentary cataract surgery, sometimes even successfully. In 1351, aging abbot Gilles le Muisit of St. Martin's in Tournai had his cataracts removed only to find that behind them, he was farsighted:

> I saw not as in my young age but as my age demanded, because I was
already an octogenarian, and I saw the sky, the sun, the moon, the
stars, though not perfectly recognizing people, and I saw everything at
a distance from me very well, but I was not able to write or read.

The first ""glasses"", which were designed to be held rather than worn, were for reading (i.e. for farsightedness). [Here's a photo](https://imgur.com/a/7KRHt) I took in the Dominican church museum in Eisenach of a 1510 altarpiece relief from Thuringia--the scene is the death of the Virgin Mary, and the man with the book and glasses is probably supposed to be a physician. Glasses were one type of iconographic shorthand for physicians (another being a flask filled with urine. You do you, Middle Ages.)

Ronald Finucane and Irina Metzler have both pointed out that we are much less likely to read about nobles with disabling conditions. There was then as there is now a stigma attached to disability, even more so because of the stronger link between sin (moral failure) and impairment. So even in miracle stories that *do* involve knights and other nobles, the recorder will allow the healed to express a sense of shame--even to the point of feeling suicidal, in one case--a consciousness of emotion denied to lower classes. 

That was the case with the knight Gilbert, whose story is told in the miracle of St. Foy. *Twice in a row* he received a head injury in combat--once while, apparently, breaking up a barfight--that caused vision problems. And he was, given the source, miraculously healed in several stages. (Draw your own medical conclusions.)

But one of the most interesting cases hops way above the others. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in the 13th century--the one who looked at the Crusades, said ""I got u, fam"" and *negotiated* his way into taking over Jerusalem from Muslim control--actually dealt with developing myopia over the course of his life. This could have been a hardship for him, as his true love was hunting. (He embarked on very few building projects over the course of his reign, but these included several hunting lodges, which is also where he preferred to spend much of his time). What did he do? He still hunted with great enthusiasm, apparently. But then, hunting in the Middle Ages wasn't about food (unless you were desperate and poaching), it was about power and masculinity and status and probably blowing off some steam. So even in the parts where humans didn't rely on their dogs and birds to do the work for them, perhaps there was not as much pressure to perform.

But then, of course, there's the ultimate solution. Can't fight like a knight, can't hunt as well as you want to?

Write a book about it.

And Frederick did."
515,AskHistorians,"I am Louis XIV and am about to have sex with my wife or mistress, do I leave my wig on or take it off?","I have to start with: I don't know, exactly. I'm not entirely sure whether anyone knows. The unfortunate thing about studying historical material culture is that people in the past often failed to record very commonplace practices because they never felt the need to. Imagine being a person in the future who only knows doors with magnetic key cards and automatic locks, trying to figure out how we today decide when to lock doors and how keys physically work. The Duc de Saint-Simon noted in his memoir of life at Louis XIV's court in the early eighteenth century that the king did have a ""little short wig"" that he wore when he ""appeared"" in bed, but that likely means that he had it on by the time he performed the *lever* rising ceremony - not necessarily that he wore it the entire time he was in bed.

One thing we do know, however, is that men didn't typically wear wigs at all times. When relaxing or going to bed, men customarily removed them and replaced them with embroidered caps [such as this one owned by the Cooper Hewitt](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/18474003/). These caps actually predated the fashion of wigs - they were worn as replacements for hats during the sixteenth century as well.

[White linen cap embroidered with silver, gold, colored silk, and spangles, 1600-1624](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O15344/nightcap-unknown/)

In terms of both materials and embroidery designs, these are actually quite similar to women's coifs and informal jackets of the period, interestingly enough.

By the end of the century, when men tended to wear them as replacements for wigs rather than hats, it was more common for men's caps to be made of a colored fabric and embroidered with larger motifs.

[Yellow silk cap embroidered with flowers, 1675-1725](https://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/39595.html)

[Brocaded silk cap, 1700-1750](https://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4134229)

These caps were usually worn while men were partially dressed, with their doublets or coats off and with a dressing gown (called at the time a morning gown, wrapping gown, banyan, or other terms) on. Despite their extremely basic construction during this period - made in the shape of a T, typically with no fastenings, although they could be belted with a sash - they were symbols of wealth and leisure, usually made out of silk or imported cotton calico, which at the time was somewhat exotic. In the memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon, it's noted that Louis XIV had dressing gowns, and that he even wore them to dine in front of courtiers toward the very end of his life.

As I noted in an earlier answer to [a question about how people had sex in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9m5t8o/what_was_having_sex_like_in_the_18th_and_19th/e7cu1fk/),

>But how often would married couples go from zero to sex? While premarital sex happened in all kinds of places depending on when couples could get alone time, marital activities seem to have generally been done in the marital bed. It's hard to find direct evidence of this, at least in the sources I have to hand, but the fact that women who wanted to avoid their husband asserting his conjugal rights (i.e. marital rape) often achieved this by avoiding the bed - by having their own bedroom, by staying up late with work, by sleeping with the children - implies that most sexual activity would be expected to happen there. (Separate bedchambers were the norm for the upper and upper-middle classes, with the wealthiest even having attached dressing rooms. I can't say exactly how far down the social scale they continued, but the working classes definitely shared beds and bedrooms.) In these cases, women and men would have already undressed and be in nightclothes, so the point is rather moot.

The majority of the sex that Louis XIV had was outside of his marriage, but the point likely still stands. Television spices up sexuality in order to titillate the viewers, but there's no reason to think that he typically went directly from full dress to sex. He had no need to be secretive, and could arrange to visit his mistresses in their official apartments or have them come to his own at his leisure, when he was in relaxed dress, probably after the *coucher* ceremony where he was put to bed. In which case, the day's wig would most likely have been on its stand and a cap on his head, although it's possible that he would have tried to wear his short bed-wig (though it seems unlikely, since there would have been nothing to hold it on during vigorous movement)."
516,AskHistorians,"The Spanish Flu of 1918 didn't have a vaccine and spread throughout the population, and ultimately about 28% of Americans were infected, but epidemiologists say we need about 70% infected for herd immunity. So why did the flu stop spreading?","Unfortunately, your question is based on an incorrect assumption.  The Spanish Flu of 1918 did not stop spreading.  It became one of the seasonal flu variants that circulated in the population[1].

The question is why did the subsequent seasons result in much fewer deaths.  The dominant hypothesis is that there was a rapid mutation to a less deadly strain after the second wave.  It is a recognized tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal over time as the deadlier strains die out, though pathogenic viruses can always mutate into a deadlier strains.  In 1952-1953 there was an influenza epidemic of the H1N1 variant that had a peculiar mortality curve, affecting the young more then the old, because the older people had some immunity due to having been exposed to the earlier 1918 variant[2].

The 1957 H2N2 pandemic, followed by the H3N2 pandemic largely crowded out the H1N1 1918 Spanish Flu from the seasonal circulation in the human population.  H1N1 variants still did circulate, but they were not the dominant strain and they were not a significant contributor to the flu seasons after 1957.  However, the 1970 swine flu outbreak at Fort Dix was an example that the Spanish Flu virus descendants were still endemic to swine and could jump back into human hosts.  This was reinforced by the 2009 swine flu pandemic, which was a re-assortment of four different H1N1 virus, and where it was noted that people born before 1950 who had exposure to the 1918 Spanish Flu virus (or its descendants) had protection from the ""new"" flu pandemic[3].  It is also an example of a less-lethal endemic virus mutating into a more deadly strain.  Since the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the seasonal trivalent inactivated flu vaccine that protects against the Swine Flu descendents also protects against the 1918 Spanish Influenza virus[4].

The normal mortality curve for flu outbreaks is usually causing higher deaths in the very young and very old.  The Spanish Flu, similar to the 1952 epidemic and to some extent the 2009 Swine pandemic had an unusual mortality curve where it affected young adults more then elderly. One theory is that the Spanish Flu caused cytokine storms which caused the higher death rates of young adults.  A 2007 study of journals of the period of time of the Spanish Flu Pandemic finds that the the flu infection was no more aggressive than other previous influenza strains.  Among the different theories on why the Spanish Flu affected young adults more is the possibility that the Spanish Flu is itself a descendent of a previous H1N1 flu that had swept through the world earlier, but was removed from the yearly circulating strains by the 1889 flu pandemic[5].

In summary, the 1918 Spanish Flu never stopped spreading.  The human population (and swine population) never achieved a herd immunity.  The strain probably evolved to be less deadly and humans have learned to live with the seasonal flu (in all its different subtypes, not just the 1918 H1N1 subtype) in a way that it ""only"" kills 290,000 to 650,000 people per year [6] globally through treatment (better nursing and treatment to manage downstream effects like bacterial infection of the lungs, cytokine storms and also through development of medicines like antivirals) and prevention (better awareness and hygiene, and the massive effort each year to develop and distribute the appropriate yearly flu vaccine).

517,AskHistorians,"When Boris Yeltsin visited Texas in 1990, he went to a grocery store and was shocked by the abundance of food. This shattered his view of Communism and led to him reforming Russia. With all the Russian spies, how did the government officials not know about the condition of America before this?","This is a matter of knowing versus comprehension. It's also a matter of practicality. Yeltsin could have undoubtedly found out the contents of the average American grocery had he cared to. It's doubtful the United States would have exerted much effort to stop him from discovering Pudding Pops or Coca-Cola. But Yeltsin never had any reason to. It was simply never relevant. Do you think Donald Trump or Obama have ever shopped in a Chinese supermarket? Probably not. It's just not relevant to their lives.

Yeltsin also probably had statistics on standards of living available to him. But it's another thing to actually see and experience it. In addition, coming from the Soviet world where statistics were often... dubious if not outright fabricated, he had at least some reason to be suspicious.

Now, onto the context. What is not open for debate: Yeltsin did indeed visit an American grocery store. He had, by all reports, a grand time. He tried some of the wares and the manager gave him some free food to take with him. He inquired about the food distribution system and how managers were chosen. He was deeply affected by this and repeatedly commented on how much better the standards of living in the US were, both to people there and to his aides. Likewise, Yeltsin' assessment that the United States was wealthier and did a better job providing for its people was simply objectively correct. There is some controversy on this point by Soviet apologists, but I'm not aware of any mainstream historian who disagrees. (There are reasons for this other than Communism, but this does not change the standards of living themselves.)

All this is attested to by multiple sources who tell the same broad story with only a few minor contradictions or unverified reports. One aide, for example, recalls Yeltsin planned to open his own chain of grocery stores on this model, and spoke about grocery stores as the fundament of the modern world. While this is not mentioned in other reports, it doesn't really introduce ambiguity into the narrative. It broadly agrees with the other accounts and doesn't contradict them in a meaningful way.

But let's pull back a little. Because this incident didn't come out of nowhere. The Soviet Union and the United States had been competing on the standards of living for decades, going back to the '50s. Before Yeltsin visited the supermarket there were multiple incidents like the Kitchen Debates and other displays where both sides tried to outdo each other in living standards. In reality, the United States was always ahead but the Soviet Union was willing to lie to make it seem otherwise. From time to time, someone would expose this and embarrass the Soviets.

By making a surprise visit and comparing conditions, Yeltsin was acting in a tradition that would have been familiar both at home and in the United States. The surprise was that Yeltsin openly admitted his side wasn't winning. *That* had never happened before.

Why did he do that? Well, he says in part because it was true. And it certainly was true. But, and I have no citation for this, politicians lie. And (I do have a citation for this) the Soviets lied all the time to make themselves look better. Why the reversal?

The pat little story is that Yeltsin saw this grocery store and decided to fight Communism. This has no historical evidence: the reforms began in 1986 (three years before) and Gorbachev explicitly wanted to preserve Communism. Yeltsin was a critic but was not, at the time, explicitly anti-communist. The context was instead of a world where Gorbachev was trying to thaw relations with the United States and reform/revitalize the Soviet Union. He was a reformer doing battle with hardliners at home while trying to keep liberals from tearing the Soviet Union apart. And Yeltsin was a reformer.

By losing one of these 'kitchen debates' (for lack of a better term) he was damaging the conservatives who didn't want to admit the Soviet Union was behind while encouraging his own reformists. It was an attempt to show he was willing to break with previous policy and tradition to force the Soviet system to be examined and reformed. At the same time, hardliners would be put in the awkward position of having to lie without the support of the Soviet government (as a result of Gorbachev's reforms). And without that support, their lies would be much more apparent. It would also warm relations with the west at a time when the Soviet Union was vulnerable (and where Gorbachev was trying to warm the relations).

But none of this answers the more personal question. This is more an explanation of why friendliness to the West fit well into his general program. *Why* did the visit affect him like this? Yeltsin undoubtedly had more power, prestige, and luxuries than anyone else in that store.

In short, because Yeltsin was a Soviet.

It's easy to dismiss people with different belief systems as either secretly believing what we believe or believing in some more base philosophy. For example, saying that Stalin's actions were not *really* about Communism but about power. No one could *really* believe that, could they? Well, usually, yes. They could and did. And Yeltsin's autobiography shows that he really, truly believed in Communism. But he believed it in a specific way: he believed it was *right*, that it was better for the working class. And this was blatant, empirical proof that the United States was beating them in providing for the working class. This is what he tells us himself.

And that genuinely shocked him.

518,AskHistorians,"How did Vanilla become the ""generic"" flavor of ice cream?","First I am not a historian, I apologize if that is not allowed I am just a Dietitian with a passion for the history of food. I would defer to an answer from a historian on this topic. 

Much of my information will come from the article ""Making a global sensation: Vanilla flavor, synthetic chemistry, and the meanings of purity"" by Nadia Berenstein. 

A large part of why we enjoy the flavors that we do is hard to quantify, but the vanilla beans were used in the cuisine of many cultures in the region notably in the drink chocolatl which was served to Cortez by Montezuma.  Many of our spices that now are common were a rarity across the world. While vanilla was incredibly saught across the world, it wasn't until it was artificially created that the ubiquity of vanilla became solidified.

The early days of its use in European cuisine were primarily as a component of chocolate which enjoyed popularity in the seventeenth century. Though botanists throughout Europe attained specimens they found their efforts fruitless without the ""Melipona"" bee that pollinates the flowers. The stubborn plant was eventually transplanted to the French island of Bourbon. 

 The transplanted vanilla orchid would remain fruitless until Charles Morren a professor of Botany first successfully pollinated the orchid artificially. A method of hand pollination was also developed by a slave named Edmond Albius on a plantation in Bourbon. As demand increased in France for delicacies like vanilla chocolate and vanilla ice French colonies began to expand cultivation in the Indian Ocean, West Indies, and Tahiti, as well as Dutch plantations in Java and German East Africa. 

Vanilla requires a labor-intensive process that requires beans to be dried, sweated, and cured which that sometimes may require months of daily work and close attention. Fortunately, the decades of *vanilla planifolias* colonization of the globe coincided with rapid advances in synthetic organic chemistry.

Vanilla was not the first synthetic flavor (this belongs to various fruit flavors), but it was the first luxury flavor to be produced synthetically. In 1874 German Chemists Ferdinand Tiemann and Wilhelm Haarmann synthesized vanillin from coniferin. This discovery was widely reported and confirmed by Karl Reimer who derived it from creosote tar. Vanillin did not enter the market cheap listed at $1,500 a kilogram considerably more than the cost of an equivalent amount of vanilla beans. New innovations in the production of synthetic vanillin lead to a drop in costs. New manufacturers across the United States and Europe challenged French and German companies' dominance of the market caused the price to plummet from 560DM in 1896 to 126DM in 1897. 

By 1900 the US saw a rapid increase in the sale of both vanilla beans and synthetic vanilla corresponding to the expanding role of sweet foods in American life. Technological innovations created the ability to manufacture ice creams, chocolates, and other confectionary items on a large scale at a low price. Both artificial vanilla and vanilla beans prices continued to decrease throughout the early 20th century. Sugary vanilla flavored treats became everyday indulgences due to the wide availability of cheap sugar and artificial vanilla. 

Today over 95% of the vanilla products on the market come from artificially produced vanillin.

519,AskHistorians,"Why do American high schools and universities use the nomenclature ""freshman, sophomore, junior, senior"" instead of, e.g., 1st-year, 2nd-year, etc.? How did that develop?","A reasonable trawl through the Internet will inform you that American universities borrowed the terminology from Oxford and Cambridge, where they had come to describe different levels of ""sophester"" or sophist--someone who *thinks they are* wise. (Sophomore adds on either a simple Latin -or 'operator' ending, or *possibly* Greek *moros*/fool--either way, the meaning is clear; the adjective ""sophomoric"" means immature). In the sixteenth century, *sophister* sometimes had an additional connotation of someone who takes money for teaching wisdom instead of ~~being an exploited adjunct~~ living a pure life of the mind or something--basically, a philosopher who sold out. This would track with the use of more advanced students employed to tutor earlier ones.

What the OED and blog posts *won't* tell you, on the other hand, is why the labels for students are inherently *insults*.

Medieval universities incubated a tradition that early modern ones would carry on with pride: periodically awful student behavior. (Also, you know, excellent academics & drool-worthy libraries & the foundation for modern scientific research &c &c.) Most infamous is student violence, of course--right along with universities' determination to shelter their own from charges of murder and rape.

But more to the point with the classifications is that university students also had a reputation for living up to a somewhat lower standard than what Robert Lowth wanted to see in Oxford:

> [A place] where a liberal pursuit of knowledge, and a genuine freedom
of thought was raised encouraged and pushed forward by
example, by commendation, and by authority

and somewhat more along the lines of what Edward Gibbon (yes, [our Edward Gibbon!](https://books.google.com/books?id=9fELAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA26&lpg=RA2-PA26&dq=To+the+university+of+Oxford+I+acknowledge+no+obligation;+and+she+will+as+cheerfully+renounce+me+for+a+son&source=bl&ots=Uzr90PgSM5&sig=X1F1rSTQayQuESXUUz9fTxZzfug&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI7_21xt3YAhVPA6wKHXg2DSYQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&q=To%20the%20university%20of%20Oxford%20I%20acknowledge%20no%20obligation%3B%20and%20she%20will%20as%20cheerfully%20renounce%20me%20for%20a%20son&f=false)) remembered:

> To the university of Oxford I acknowledge no obligation;
and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son, as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother. I spent fourteen months
at Magdalen College; they proved the fourteen months the
most idle and unprofitable of my whole life...

> In the
university of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors
have for these many years given up altogether even the
pretence of teaching.

> As
a gentleman commoner, I was admitted to the society of the
fellows, and fondly expected that some questions of literature
would be the amusing and instructive topics of their discourse.
Their conversation stagnated in a round of college business,
Tory politics, personal anecdotes, and private scandal...The names of Wenman and Dashwood were more frequently
pronounced, than those of Cicero and Chrysostom.

The point isn't that there were no deeply studious students making serious academic gains of their own and scientific progress overall, it's the *reputation* they had for being--well, *sophists*: more concerned with the social life of debate and politics and looking/acting smart to each other, than living up to some lofty ideal. Oxford opened its first coffeehouse in 1650. And by early modern coffeehouse, we should mean something like a literary salon--a place where the literati would gather to discuss intellectual topics and current events.

Of course, to contemporary eyes, this was a great deficit from what it should be. A 1901 investigation of Oxford in the 18th century summed up its findings in this description of freshman, freshly-minted college men:

> We see the public schoolman, just freed from the rod of
Busby’s successors, strutting about town for a week or so
before entrance, courting his schoolfellows’ envy...swaggering
at coffee-houses, and giving himself a scholar’s airs at the
bookshops.

and things did not improve over the years:

> A month or two sees them metamorphosed into complete smarts...The ""smart's"" breakfast is scarcely over by ten.

It's important to keep in mind that these attitudes were not only *external* in the sense of town-gown relations or alumni making a point about the quality of English universities compared to continental ones. Student university hazing could be absolutely brutal. Internal university hierarchy, built upon the idea that students with less experience were complete no-nothing fools, reigned supreme.

Most infamously, there's a late medieval sort of ""Latin textbook"" for university students that consists of a series of dialogues we think were meant to teach students useful Latin vocabulary for surviving uni daily life. One of the settings is a violent and humiliating initiation ritual in which the freshman or *beanus* is made into an animal that must be tamed. Well, scholars will continue to dispute whether in the 15th century this was a literary fantasy that drew on a solid tradition of hazing. On the other hand, there seems to be fairly solid evidence that early modern students at some universities took the *description* as *prescription*--and performed the hazing ceremony.

The straightforward etymologies of sophomore, junior (sophister), and senior (sophister) from Greek *sophia* and Greek/Latin *sophister*, in other words, aren't really the interesting part of the story--and a much funnier one for those of us who never attended college or have already graduated."
520,AskHistorians,"Christopher Columbus was arrested and ostracised for a long list of well documented tyrannical and brutal acts in the New World, and for incompetence as governor of Spain's earliest colonies. How did he go from a disgraced figure to one who is celebrated by statues, and even his own holiday?","Expanding from an earlier answer of mine:

-----------

The image and idea of Columbus has gone through several phases, historically, but the focus here is going to be on the current epoch, and the rise of Columbus Day, as that plays the most important part in your question and the current perception and how we got there.

Columbus Day is very closely tied to Italian-American identity, originating almost exclusively as a holiday celebrated by Italian Immigrants, who wanted to celebrate their early ties to the 'New World', and stake their claim to being part of the idea of America (it is interesting to note, also, that Italian immigrant communities formed a unified idea of their *Italianness* in a way that wasn't quite as present in Italy itself although it quickly expanded to be more broadly embraced by immigrant Catholic communities generally in the period. This was a time when immigrants, especially Catholics and those from Southern Europe, were looked down upon and excluded by the many within the dominant White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant culture of the United States - something I've written about previously specifically with an eye on the KKK in the 1910s-1920s, [so may be of interest](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9l4uus/italians_were_considered_nonwhites_until_1945_did/e75k1dv/).

It expanded from Italian / Catholics communities into the wider American public over time and by the turn of the century was a somewhat popular celebration, having been designated a time for national celebration in 1892, and celebrating ""American unity"" in the words of one historian, as Columbus made for a great time to celebrate the 'melting pot' concept of which was becoming important to the mythos of the American identity

Angelo Noce, an Italian immigrant, was the big proponent of making it a Federal Holiday, with the stated goal of celebrating Italian Heritage through it, as they had been celebrating it for some decades before everyone else, and considered it ""their"" holiday. The Knights of Columbus were also a big supporter. Being predominantly Irish-Catholic, they likewise saw promise the elevation of a Catholic figure into the highest pantheon of American history, since, as noted, Catholic communities were likewise looked down upon, and seen as at best half American, with dual loyalties not only to their country, but the Pontiff in Rome.

Mass parades on Columbus Day quickly became a way for Catholic groups to demonstrate their civic pride and patriotism, and make the public spectacle of their *Americanness*. Kubal quotes one journalist who, writing about the parade and speeches given by Catholic organizations in in the 1890s, noted how ""*if any doubt existed in the minds of any that Catholics are Americans in every fiber of their being, it ought to vanish in the light of the addresses made everywhere yesterday*"". 

Similarly, drives to put up Columbus statues were spearheaded by Italian-American fraternal groups such as the Columbian Federation or the Order of Sons of Italy in America (although as with the parades, some statues were pushed for by non-Italian Catholic groups). The statues were seen as important, visual symbols of their acceptance into American society, and also the growing ability for Italian-Americans to have political power. The very act of placing the statue in a public place by the government was an important reflection on what the Italian-American community was able to lobby for.

All of this lobbying and parading about saw real progress. In 1905, Colorado (Where Noce lived and had been strenuously pushing for this) became the first to recognize the day as an official holiday, dedicated as:

>created for Catholics, particularly immigrant Catholics, and their children, the special Catholic holiday of the year [...] Christmas and Thanksgiving are religious or family holidays for all the people; Columbus Day belongs to our Catholic people.

Other states such as New York and California soon following suit. It would become a Federal Holiday in 1937, although by that point Noce had passed away so did not see his idea reach culmination.

And for the most part, there wasn't any of the controversy around him we now have. Regressive ideas about the indigenous peoples of the Americas, seen by far too many people as savage heathens for whom the introduction of Christianity and ""Civilization"" was a clear and important good for them (or at least the ones who survived the waves of genocide over the next few centuries...), Columbus and what he brought about was a clear and unambiguous positive for many. To quote one example given from the period:

>Columbus was fired by the noblest motive that can guide the action of man. Every page of his life is teaming with evidence that he went forth on his perilous voyage to carry the Gospel to debased and erring savages, and to pass it to them with the torch of true Christian Civilization... Where shall we find a character worthy to be compared to with him? [...] Columbus was in a measure divine [....] Write his name beside no human hero.

Put plainly, that wouldn't have been to controversial in the 1890s when it was written. Columbus was a hero. He brought civilization to the virgin land of savages barely eking out an existence in the stone age, and made it a place where white people could put that land, which was being wasted by the backwards natives, to good use, and allow a great nation to flourish [ /s]. Italians, and Catholics, were pleased as punch to have this hero that they could point to as *theirs*, and stake their claim as being foundational to the American pageant.

Now, I need hardly point out that as time passed through the past century, attitudes changed *significantly* towards Columbus, and by the 1992 anniversary, Columbus was a very controversial figure, and has only gotten more so since then, as anyone looking at the news this week is clearly aware! Due to the 20 year rule, I'm not going to discuss the *current* stuff in-depth, and whether we should be destro**y**ing th**e**se **s**tatues but the indigenous peoples of the Americas are, unsurprisingly, the leader in opposition to the continuing celebration of a man who more and more are coming to recognize as the kickstarter of a mass genocide (and don't miss /u/Snapshot52 who [covers the this angle here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/h7l1nv/christopher_columbus_was_arrested_and_ostracised/fumak0w/)); and as perspectives change, the Italian-American lobby has been at the forefront of holding onto what they consider to be their national holiday.

523,AskHistorians,How did the money transfer for the Louisiana Purchase happen in practice? Did Americans load a bunch of money in ships and send it to France?,"In 1801, James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston (the R. also stood for Robert, oddly enough) were sent to Paris not to buy the enormous swath of land subsequently called the Louisiana Purchase but to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta, thereby securing the lucrative Mississippi River shipping route. Negotiations fell through, and it wasn't until Livingston returned in 1803 that Napoleon was so hard-up on cash due to the continent-wide war of conquest he was waging that he was willing to make a deal with the Americans. At the time, Livingston was authorized by Jefferson to spend up to $9 million in order to purchase New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi. Since the US was planning on making a significant purchase from France, the delegation (Monroe rejoined Livingston in Paris shortly thereafter) travelled to Paris with $3 million in gold. In 1803,[gold was worth just under $20 an ounce](http://onlygold.com/Info/Historical-Gold-Prices.asp), which means they were travelling with almost 10,000 lbs of gold. This wasn't even remotely close to the carrying capacity of freighters of the time. [""Tea Clipper"" Frigates of that time could carry twenty times that weight.](http://www.tea.co.uk/tea-clippers).

Now, the negotiations took a turn when Napoleon decided he needed more money and offered the whole Louisiana Purchase for $15 million. Livingston and Monroe were authorized by Jefferson to spend up to 9 million on New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi, so when given this offer, they had to make a decision without the President's approval, and just couldn't pass up the deal. Oddly enough, I just read the chapter describing the negotiations in Stephen Clarke's very entertaining *1000 Years of Annoying the French*.  According to Clarke, the purchase was paid for with the above-mentioned 3 million in gold as a down payment, with the cancelling of 3.75 million in debt that France owed to the US for French piracy on American ships since the revolution, and the rest was issued in bonds. Again from Clarke:

>French Banks were too nervous to accept the bonds, and two foreign banks had to step in to provide the cash. The first was Hope and Company,  a bank based in Amsterdam but set up by Scotsmen. The second was a London bank, Barings. Napoleon was in such dire straits that he agreed to sell the bonds to the banks at a 12.5% discount. 

I hope this answers your question sufficiently!

Tsk tsk, please. This is the *real* Emperor of Europe speaking. I fought the French, Moors, and Heretics all simultaneously at the same time. You couldn't even handle the English. When you are ready to graduate from your boring and linear warfare, call me. "
525,AskHistorians,"If a King fell in battle, was anyone 'allowed ' to kill him or did the common soldier avoid him for their higher ranks to kill him?","No, in medieval Europe,  there were no restrictions on common soldiers killing a king or any other aristocrats. If soldiers were able to identify a particularly important individual, there would probably have been a mad scramble to capture him rather than kill him outright, both for political purposes and for the potential for ransom profits. This happened to the French king Jean II at Poitiers, who was taken prisoner in a furious melee where other high-ranking French aristocrats, who ordinarily would have made excellent ransoms, were killed (possibly by accident as English troops swarmed to grab Jean specifically). When kings were killed outright in combat, it does not seem to have been a particular mark of controversy. John the Blind, King of Bohemia, died at Crecy but his killer was not specifically identified in accounts of the battle and the story of his death is conveyed merely as an illustration of John's bravery and valiant nature. Kings who fought did so in the full knowledge that they were at risk of being killed or captured at the battlefield.

English military contracts from the Hundred Years War suggest that there was no stigma attached to a common soldier capturing important aristocrats; they often contained clauses saying that any particular important prisoners (like a prince or something) would be handed over to the king in exchange for a cash payment. This worked to both parties'  advantage: common soldiers would probably not be be financially able to house and feed a prisoner (especially a royal prisoner) during the period in which the ransom was negotiated and paid. If there was any limitation on killing aristocrats, it would be that troops wanted to maximize their profit by taking nobles alive for ransom. This is most apparent in the hesitation of some English troops to kill their prisoners at the Battle of Agincourt. This incident is often taken as some kind of commentary on class relations, but in reality is just a reflection of soldiers looking out for their bottom line. "
526,AskHistorians,"In 1822, Thomas Jefferson gave his enslaved daughter $50, put her on a stagecoach to the North, and from there she ""disappeared from history."" Is there any evidence of what happened to her after that?","Well, the answer is unfortunately not that satisfying, but I expect that you came into this question realizing it was a somewhat vain hope given the use of ""disappeared from history"". To provide a little background, Sally Hemmings had a number of children, some of whom died in infancy, which are generally accepted as being fathered by Thomas Jefferson (I would direct to [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6aqa2e/panel_ama_slaves_and_slavers/dhj0rqm/?context=2) for more discussion, broadly, of the sexual relationships between masters and slaves in the antebellum South). Whether or not this was fact has been debated since before Jefferson himself died, and scholarly opinion has swayed about, but it is pretty much now the consensus.

Anyways though. Harriet, described as ""nearly as white as anybody and very beautiful"" had no trouble passing for white, and as you already are aware, made use of this. She was freed in 1822 at the age of 21, apparently on a promise Jefferson had made to Sally Hemings to do so when the children reached that age. The documentation of Harriet's liberation is almost next to nothing. Edmund Bacon, who worked as an overseer at Monticello, described her departure, being the one who gave her the $50 that you mention, and stating she had been headed for Philadelphia. And as for her life after she headed north, we only have one account which we can give any real credence to, that from her brother Madison, who wrote in 1873:

>Harriet married a white man in good standing in Washington City, whose name I could give, but will not, for prudential reason. She raised a family of children, and so far as I know they were never suspected of being tainted with African blood in the community where she lived or lives. I have not heard from her for ten years, and do not know whether she is dead or alive. She thought it to her interest, on going to Washington, to assume the role of a white woman, and but her dress and conduct as such I am not aware that her identity as Harriet Hemings of Monticello has ever been discovered. 

Washington City in this case refers to the District of Columbia as it was then known, and it would appear that while she kept a low profile, she did not choose to cut all ties with her family, at least immediately, as Madison claims to have remained in contact with her through the 1860s (he was writing in 1873). He also gives us reason to believe it quite possible that she has living descendants, but of course was much to guarded to allow any information to get out which could give much of a thread to follow. What the end of communications even meant is up in the air - perhaps she decided to cut her final tie to non-white society, or perhaps she simply died. We can only speculate. But in any case, Madison's account is the lone source we can rely on to reconstruct any sense of her post-emancipation life.

She was not the only child of Jefferson and Hemmings to follow such a route. While Madison and Eston both left records, writings, and known descendants, their brother Beverley was similarly allowed to leave Monticello for the North, and even less seems sure about his fate then his sister, doing a similar disappearing act but without, it seems, even the record of correspondence that Harriet left He was briefly in contact, long enough to communicate back that he had married a white woman and that they had a daughter, living in Washington City, but that seems to be the end of it. In both the case of Beverley and Harriet, it should be noted, Jefferson *officially* recorded them as being escaped slaves, as their departure was recorded in the 'farm book', but it was quite clearly allowed with his approval as a means of sending them North in technical compliance with the aforementioned agreement he had made with Sally. The backhanded means of liberation is thought to have been a means of following through without providing ammunition for those looking to prove the parentage.

Now, as to the second part of your question, you might perhaps want to x-post to /r/AskScience as it is less a history question that one for a geneticist. What I do understand of these things would imply that it is possible to find genetic matches that show relations by various degrees, but it isn't like those genes are signed ""T.J."" Establishing who that common ancestor is takes a lot more leg work. To compare to the famous claim about Genghis Khan's widespread DNA, this is based on finding the the same Y-chromosome (which records patrilineal descent) in millions of people that shows they share a common male ancestor a certain period back in time. Genghis Khan is then assumed to be the one based on historical circumstances. But I would hesitate to say more, as again, this is getting into the territory for a scientist to discuss.

527,AskHistorians,"Would it have been possible for a roman citizen around 1 A.D. to obtain everything needed to make a Cheeseburger, assuming they had the knowledge of how to make one?","Let's start with beef, since the patty is the easiest part here, and also the most important part of the burger. The romans absolutely had beef. There are dozens of references to beef throughout greek and roman literature. In the odyssey, Odysseus kills some sacred cattle, and cooks the meat. I'm sure that in a big city like rome, it would be easy to come across some beef. Grinding beef by hand might be hard, but I'm sure our McRoman can pull it off, considering his need for a delicious burger. You can do that with a decent knife, but it'll be an absolute pain. 

Next, we need cheese. Pliny, in his *Natural History* (XI, 96-97) talks about cheese. In chapter 97, he lists off a bunch of kinds of cheese, but what sounds good to me is his comment that ""Goats also produce a cheese which has been of late held in the highest esteem, its flavour being heightened by smoking it."" Smoked goat cheese would be nice on a burger, if a little off from traditional McDonalds. 

Our greens are next. Onion is also mentioned in Pliny's text. IN book XIX, chapter 32, Pliny talks about onions. He mentions a few varieties of onions. The onions of Crete are known for ""the sweetness of their flavour."" Sweet onion is my preferred burger onion, so let's hope our McRoman can find that. However, he can certainly find some kind of onion. We're doing good!

Now for Lettuce. Once again, we're in luck! The romans ate lots of lettuce, and once again, Pliny has us covered. Chapter 38 of the same book is all about lettuce. He describes a bunch of lettuces, including one so large it could be used for a small garden gate! The footnotes in the translation seem to indicate this might be Sessile, or romaine lettuce, so we'll go with that. However, any lettuce will do here, so let's not worry too much about that. We got lettuce! 

Pliny disappoints here with pickles. Despite devoting Chapters 2 - 5 of Book 20 to cucumbers as a medicine, and chapter 23 of book XIX to cucumbers as something to grow in your garden, Pliny doesn't actually mention that you can pickle cucumbers anywhere I saw. Columella' *de re rustica* (on agriculture), however, does. He states that you mix up ""hard brine,"" which is heavily saturated saltwater, and vinegar (which was made from wine and spices), and then you add cucumbers and all kinds of other stuff. Your pickles will be giving your burger a real funky taste. 

Mustard seed is also mentioned in Pliny. Apicus mentions mustard as well, and wants everyone to use it all the time. I didn't feel like crawling through more translations for all this, so I just went out and found someone else's adaptation of Apicus's mustard recipe. I linked it down below. The recipe is going to make a stone ground, strong flavored mustard. It's got some whole seeds, and is probably closest to modern brown mustard. This is strong artisanal stuff, so again with the funky taste and strong burger. 

Bread is going to be expensive at the least. Modern flour is of great quality, historically speaking. Only the finest flour would have been fine and white. Off in Book XVIII, Chapter 26, Pliny talks about bread and risen bread. He says that ""At the present day, however, the leaven is prepared from the meal that is used for making the bread. For this purpose, some of the meal is kneaded before adding the salt, and is then boiled to the consistency of porridge, and left till it begins to turn sour."" That's sourdough - they have a starter culture, and then they would use it. It's not fed and kept like a modern sourdough culture, but it is decent starter yeast. The flavor from it will be inconsistent, and you'll probably have some grit from the grinding, but if your McRoman shills out all the cash he can, he'll get decent sourdough bread. This will not be a neutral flavored bun, and it's not going to look great. But you could buy some sort of small loaf at a bakery, so at least we have a bun. 

Sesame seeds are also not the hardest. It's an old crop, and a quick search pulled up a JSTOR result on how the ""seed was well known to ancient greek and roman authors."" I'm sure our Ronald McRoman could walk on down to the market and buy a little thing of sesame seeds if needed. So he just needs to pay the baker to put a bunch of sesame seeds on the nicest small loaf he has before he bakes it. Easy peasy!

The romans would have had frying pans and griddles. The Royal Ontario museum of archeology has an article they published in the American Journal of Archaeology, which I found reproduced on The University of Chicago's website. It includes a number of illustrations of Frying pans and Griddles. They look not bad for frying. 

In summary: Yes. we're going to burger town. But it's going to be gourmet, and not what we're used to. The biggest issue will be the beef, which is going to be a pain to butcher into ground beef. But it won't be that off from what you might get in a fancy hipster restaurant. I dunno how much this might all cost, sorry.

528,AskHistorians,What did Hitler do his first week in power?,"The first week wasn't especially important but it was part of a very short arc that saw Hitler go from opposition political leader to absolute dictator in a series of steps. 

The Depression in Germany splintered public opinion. This led to a very unstable legislature in where no one party could govern effectively. As a result, there was an increasing reliance on government by emergency decree by otherwise mainstream parties. This established norms for authoritarianism and anti-democratic behaviour but had little to do with the Nazis. They were just a growing opposition party at this point, seen as outside realistic voting options for most. 

Hitler announced he would only seek power through elections in 1931, which helped solidify him as a viable political choice for the middle class, capitalists, military officers and other conservatives. Before that, Hitler and the Nazis were seen as ruffians outside the pale of good taste that appealed to angry violent yahoos. 

Hitler came a strong second in the January 1932 Presidential election to Hindenburg, and remained leader of a large but not in any way dominant political party. The Nazis were one of numerous parties in a highly fractured legislature. More parliamentary elections were held in July and November of 1932 but there was no ability to form a majority government that was stable, and the minority administrations were rudderless. 

After the November elections, a number of leading politicians and wealthy men appealed to President Hindenberg to appoint Hitler Chancellor in order to get stability. In January 1933, he came to power in a coalition with just three positions for the Nazis but critically, control of the police. 

That first week wasn't especially profound. But Hitler quickly dissolved the legislature and called for new elections to be held in early March. I'm not sure if that was in the first week or not, but the calling of the elections wasn't especially crucial. 

Feburary 27, 1933 was crucial: The Reichstag building was set on fire. A Communist was found inside in incriminating circumstances, accused of the crime by the Nazi policing minister and the resulting political crisis gave Hitler the excuse to issue the Reichstag Fire Decree. He suspended basic rights and allowed arrest without trial. Mass arrests of communists and political opponents were combined with political violence and intense anti-communist propaganda. 

There is a near consensus that the fire was the work of that communist. There is a minority view that the Nazis had a role in setting the fire and framed the communists to give them the excuse to issue the decree and polarize the election against the communists. Either way, the fire gave Hitler the excuse to issue the decree and that was act that got him a dictatorship. 

The Nazis came short of a majority in the election. To remedy this, they proposed legislation giving Hitler a 4 year temporary dictatorship. This required a super majority in the House, and they didn't have the votes. So the Nazis used the Reichstag Fire Decree powers and their control of the police to arrest the communist members of the legislature. They also detained some of the Social Democrats and physically intimidated others. They created so much chaos and intimidation, and took away so many opposition votes, that they made their bill viable. 

On March 23, 1933, the Reichstag voted to grant Hitler those ""temporary"" powers to enact laws without the consent of the legislature. From here they expanded their campaign to outlawing the Social Democrats as well as the Communists, then dissolved all trade unions. Political opponents were sent to the concentration camps. By June, all other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. 

The first week in power wasn't that important. But democracy was completely dissolved within five months of Hitler assuming office and Germany turned into a one-party state that jailed and murdered opponents.

530,AskHistorians,"In 1967, 90% of Australia voted ""yes"" in a referendum to recognise Aboriginals as Australian citizens. With such overwhelming public support, what did the ""no"" campaign look like?","There was a prominent 'yes' campaign in the 1967 referendum, run by the organisation Federal Council for the Advancement Of Aboriginals And Torres Strait Islanders, which had posters, advertisements in papers, and even advertising jingles on radio ([there are some examples of editorials and ads here](http://indigenousrights.net.au/civil_rights/the_referendum,_1957-67/campaigning_for_a_yes_vote)). In contrast, there was *no* significant 'no' campaign in the 1967 referendum - which made it unique amongst Australian referenda. 

In parliament, all of the major parties supported a 'yes' vote, and so there was no published 'case' for a 'no' vote in the parliamentary record. And this was the point, in a way: the referendum to amend the references to indigenous people in the constitution was a surefire thing that the huge majority of people had agreed on by 1967 (successful referendums being necessary to change the Australian constitution). The government of the time hoped to get up another, more controversial, amendment to the constitution relating to Federal vs state powers, and were hoping that that amendment would piggyback its way to success on the more popular one. 

It should be said that there's some controversy over the meaning of the constitutional amendment to omit the mentions of indigenous peoples in the constitutions; it's more complicated than 'recognising Aboriginals as Australian citizens'. Attwood and Markus in 1998 argued that its implications for the legal rights and status of indigenous peoples in Australia were slight, as in most states Aborigines had already had the rights of citizens, such as the right to vote (apart from, sort of, in Western Australia and Queensland). Attwood and Markus argue that the change was largely symbolic for this reason. Elsewhere, Taffe in 2007 argued that the real change that resulted from the constitutional amendment was that Aboriginal affairs was no longer a state but rather a Federal responsibility. Where, previously, Federal governments had argued that indigenous people were the responsibility of the states, they no longer had this particular excuse; as a result, for example, the Whitlam government set up a department of Aboriginal Affairs in 1972. 

There are a few reasons why the 'yes' vote was popular, especially amongst the majority of the Australian population that lived in cities. By 1967, the advent of television in the 1950s had opened many eyes to how difficult conditions were for indigenous peoples. Additionally, the Australian public was aware of international opprobrium about the Apartheid of South Africa, and did not want to become an international pariah, and the referendum seemed a clear way to demonstrate that. And in the 1960s there was a new-found prominence for indigenous rights activists, such as organisations like FCAATSI. And as the change was in many ways symbolic, there were few real grounds for opposition to it, as nobody particularly felt they would lose out (which perhaps might have been different if the consitutional amendments clearly implied the land rights which came about after the Mabo decision in the 1990s, for example).

In general, advocacy for the 'no' vote was largely seen in public in letters to the editor, and was often quite racist; one letter to the editor of the *Adelaide Advertiser* claimed the vote would propel indigenous people ""into the turmoil of a civilization they probably do not understand and do not want"". More genteel arguments against the amendment revolved around arguments for states' rights, which would be undermined by the change to the constitution. However, even this was quite muted; the Premier of Queensland, Frank Nicklin, appears to have had assurances by Harold Holt that they would continue working with the states on Aboriginal Affairs. There's also some suggestion that state Premiers were happy to handball responsibility for a difficult portfolio - that they probably did not understand and did not want - to the Federal government.

The highest 'no' vote was in Western Australia, where there was a 20% no vote. Western Australia of course had a successful referendum to secede from Australia in 1933 (which was ignored by the Federal parliament), which is emblematic of Western Australians having less trust in the distant, Eastern-based Federal Government than the rest of Australia. There were also higher 'no' votes in country areas - the highest being in Kalgoorlie in country Western Australia, which almost hit 30% (and which still has some significant and highly publicised tensions between the indigenous and white parts of its community).

531,AskHistorians,"Wikipedia's List of Famines has a listing for an Iranian / Persian famine from 1917-1919 which claimed 8-10 million lives, nearly half the population at the time, but doesn't have a page for it, and I've never heard of it. Can anyone here teach us more about it?","While i'm far from knowledgeable in that area, it seems that scholarship on the 1917-1919 Famine is sorely lacking. The main text appears to be *The Great Famine and Genocide in Persia, 1917-1919* by Mohammad Gholi Majd. However, Majd's thesis has taken some hits, according to reviewer Willem Floor, Majd makes three assertions:

* “the 1917-18 famine in Iran was caused by British intervention in Iran”

* “as a result 40 percent or 9 million of the population died”

* “the subject of the famine and the resulting genocide has been ignored by scholars so far”

To begin, Majd goes to great lengths to pick and choose his sources, ignoring sources within the British archives and over-relying on US sources, and those British sources he does use (the diaries of the British generals whom he blames the famine on) work against his theory that the British government acted to exacerbate the famine. It seems far more likely that the famine was caused by a combination of Russo-Turkish fighting and foraging in Iran, poor harvests, and bad weather conditions in the grain producing regions of Persia. Additionally, in rural areas, the famine was aggravated by the presence of those hoarding grain whose effect was minimized in places such as Tehran when local authorities took control of the food supply and dispersed it as necessary. 

On the second point, Majd’s choice of 9 million is likely inaccurate as he picks and chooses his census data, ignoring more accurate numbers taken from demographer Bharier:

> “The author rejects the population figures for 1914 as calculated by Bharier using the backward regressive analysis, which is a standard demographic tool. Majd does not explain why he faults the methodology and assumptions used by Bharier. He only states that Bharier failed to mention the occurrence of the famine and therefore his data are wrong. Moreover, the US consul stated that in 1914 the population of Iran was 20 million, a figure that is credible given that the number of votes in the Tehran elections also shows that the population of Tehran was in the order of 400,000. Majd does not cite or discuss any other estimates by contemporaries that offer much lower, and in my estimation, more realistic figures. In 1919, the population of Tehran was 200,000 and the population of Iran as a whole was 11 million, according to Bharier. Ergo, a genocide of 9 million people. Majd does not explain why he has confidence in Bharier's 1919 population figure (p. 52) but not in his 1914 figure”

The *Cambridge History of Iran Vol. 7* agree with Bharier’s numbers and Dr. Mahmood Messkoub writes in *Social Policy in Iran in the Twentieth Century* ""Majd claims that the famine of 1917-1919 killed half the population, an exaggeration surely that does not tally well with the evidence provided in his otherwise useful overview of famine in that period.""

Floor tentatively agrees with Majd’s third point stating:  “It is true that so far few historians have dealt with the 1917-18 famine, and after having read this book I think there is a real need that somebody does. Majd's objective is not to understand why the famine happened and why its impact was so devastating... for he only wants to show Albion's perfidy and assign blame. “

532,AskHistorians,"In “The emperor’s new groove”, Yzma is portrayed as a high ranking government official. In real life, could women attain such positions of power in Inca society?","I'm sure /u/qhapaqocha is going to come in and hit this out of the park, but I'll make a first pass at it, if that's alright. I can think of four ways women could attain positions of high rank within the Inca system of government.

The first and probably most obvious is to marry the Emperor, the Sapa Inca. His official wife —who was almost always one of his sisters or half-sisters (not step-sisters, thank you to u/MooseFlyer for catching my mistake)— held the position of Coya, Empress, which came with a good deal of religious veneration in addition to the soft power that comes from having ready access to the most powerful man in the Inca world. Below the Coya there were other wives and concubines —both related and unrelated to the emperor— and they had as much personal power and authority as their personal relationship to the emperor and their status as mother of various princes and princesses determined. Imperial favourites and mothers to prominent royals were women of great influence.

The second position that immediately comes to mind is to be the head of a Panaca. The Panaca is an institution unique to the Inca. Emperors were mummified upon their death, and that mummy continued to hold a court in its palace, ruling over much of its former estate, forever. The trouble with a mummified emperor, of course, is that it doesn't talk much. How do you know what it wants to do with all that wealth? Well, a cult of royal courtiers formed around the mummy and interpreted its wishes. Any Inca could join a Panaca —although only one Panaca, and their powers and influences did vary— and this became an avenue for both men and women of unimportant birth or low reputation to align themselves with an organization whose power might almost rival that of the current Sapa Inca. The inner circle around a mummy was often almost entirely female, and though we do not know quite how leadership within the Panaca's courtiers was decided, it may well be that the fact that men had other career opportunities outside the cult dedicated to a mummified emperor saw ambitious women commit themselves more fully to climbing up through the ranks to wield real power over the wealth of the deceased emperors. 

Third, Chosen Women were beautiful girls taken from their parents by the Inca State and put into special houses until they were married to either the Emperor, one of the Emperor's favourites, or to Inti, the Sun God who was the patron god of the Inca.* Now a Chosen Woman had little power, it is true, but a Bride of the Sun who went on to become the leader of a House of Chosen Women —especially the large ones in Cuzco and on the Island of the Sun in Lake Titicaca (then Lake Chucuito)— might be equated to a Mother Superior or an Abbess of a particularly powerful religious institution. What happened within the walls of her domain were her business, and her House of Chosen Women had enormous influence on what happened in the surrounding area.

Finally, the Inca were polytheists, and they were very open to the gods and cults of the people they absorbed into their empire, provided the superiority of the Inca pantheon was acknowledged. In that spirit, female religious leaders and especially women with oracular powers were given as much power within Tahuantinsuyu as they would have held before their worshipers were amalgamated into the Empire. The Inca were also willing to creating new female religious figures of enormous power. Probably the best example of this happened when Mama Ocllo —Coya to Topa Cusi Yupanki and mother of Huanya Capac— died. Huayna Capac adored his mother, and so he commissioned the creation of a new state cult in her honour, including a young woman to be known as Mama Ocllo's Voice, who had the ability to speak on his mother's behalf. Years later during the great revolt when the northern third of the Empire (roughly Ecuador) revolted, several units of pure-blooded Inca were embarrassed during a siege and then publicly berated by Huayna Capac. Now the rest of the Inca military were soldiers fulfilling their tax labour quota, but pure-blooded Inca —Pacuyoks, Ear-Plug Men— considered themselves to be volunteers. They decided to 'unvolunteer' and march home to Cuzco, and only the timely intervention of Mama Ocllo's Voice heaping them with praise and promising them riches turned the deserters around. 

To circle back to your reference to Yzma, while none of these are a perfect fit for her, I think from context we can establish she's not married to the Emperor, and if she was running a Panaca we would see her in close proximity to a mummy and speaking on its behalf. If she was a Bride of Inti running a House of Chosen Women, she wouldn't have Kronk as a henchman, because Houses of Chosen Women were exclusively female domains. Yzma —to the extent that Disney cares about such things— almost certainly was some kind of witch or religious figure. She clearly has magical abilities and the freedom and power to go where she wants, when she wants, doing what she wants.

---

As a footnote, let me explain that asterisk I put after Inti the sun god who was the patron of the Inca. There is a lot we don't know about the Inca religion. There is a theory that I like the sound of that suggests Inti was not actually the Imperial patron in the Inca pantheon. He was more the patron god of their empire-building. As Tahuantinsuyu grew, the Inca built sun temples on heights overlooking their conquered peoples to let the new citizens know who was boss, but Inti as an Empire Builder and Huanacauri as their war idol were probably much more cults of conquest than of true reverence to the Inca. Viracocha, the Creator God and head of the Inca pantheon, was probably the true patron of the Inca, but they did not create many new temples to honour him during the course of their empire-building. They did maintain and glorify the places where others worshiped him, though.

534,AskHistorians,"Who was Sun Tzu writing for? Given that Art of War gives strategic principles in what are necessarily adversarial circumstances, how did it become widely circulated? Would that not have been disadvantageous to those who inherited his advice?","This is a very interesting question. In an environment of fiercely hostile states competing for supremacy, it doesn't really make sense for a successful general to write down his knowledge for all to read. And any ruler who got hold of such a document would find it in his best interests to surpress it. So how did a text on military methods end up as one of the most famous and widely read texts from Ancient China?

In many ways, the 孫子兵法 (*Sun Zi Bing Fa*, ""Master Sun's Art of War"") is not the most promising place to look for an answer. The origins of the work are shrouded in mystery; the author may or may not be historical; the manuscript tradition is fraught with difficulties; the text itself was summed up by Robin Yates as ""terse and obscure"" and by Victor Mair as ""extraordinarily terse and maddeningly obscure"". We'll have to dig into these issues a bit if we are to get any sense of what the *Sun Zi* was meant to achieve.

First, the origins. At first glance, this question seems easy to answer: in his 史記 (*Shi Ji*, ""Records of the Grand Historian""), the Han Dynasty scholar Sima Qian tells us that the *Sun Zi* was written around the early 5th century BC by a famous general called Sun Wu. Sima Qian offers some delightful biographical details of this Sun Wu, including the famous story of how he trained the concubines of the king of Wu in heavy infantry drill. The notion that there was indeed a historical Master Sun, who wrote his treatise on warfare at the end of the Spring and Autumn Period, is still held by many. If we adopt this view, the answer to your question is relatively simple: a fugitive from the northern state of Qi (according to one version of the story), Sun Wu needed to impress his new master the king of Wu, and apart from his display as a drillmaster, the compilation of his Thirteen Chapters (the *Sun Zi*) would have provided evidence of his abilities. The biographical tradition helpfully notes that his advice and leadership allowed Wu to expand and conquer its neighbour, Chu. 

The problem with this account of the genesis of the *Sun Zi* is that there is no earlier account of the life of a general named Sun Wu, and that the very practice of assigning authors to works is not something the Chinese actually did until after the end of the Spring and Autumn period. The find of a collection of texts on strips of bamboo - the traditional recording method - in a group of graves dating to the late 2nd century BC has confirmed that the *Sun Zi* existed more or less in its currently known form at that time, but there is no evidence that would support a date as early as the 400s BC. Moreover, if it did date that far back, it would be *by far* the earliest Chinese military treatise, with a gap of well over a century between it and its oldest successor. 

Indeed, the text itself has been shown to reflect the military practice of the Warring States period (c. 475-221 BC), not the Spring and Autumn period (c. 771-476 BC) in which it was supposedly written. The well-organised, well-drilled infantry armies envisioned by Master Sun do not belong to the era of chariot-borne warlords and their loose entourages that was the Spring and Autumn period. Its references to crossbows must place it in the period after these weapons were invented (sometime in the 4th century BC). In other words, the text is far more likely to be a product of the 4th century BC than the early 5th; as far as we can tell, the spread and recognition of the work as a military classic belongs to the early Han Dynasty.

It is not surprising, then, that Chinese scholars as early as the 13th century AD have wondered whether the legendary author of the *Sun Zi* ever really existed. Many modern experts have been persuaded by Jens Østergard Petersen's argument that the details of Sima Qian's biography of Sun Wu are generic, and that all its elements can be found in biographies of other generals too. Sun Wu's name (effectively meaning something like ""wandering warrior"") is considered too convenient, and his historical context too vague, to take him seriously as a character of the late Spring and Autumn period. In fact, there is robust evidence of the existence of a general and military expert with the surname Sun - but his first name was Bin, and he lived well over a century after the alleged time in which Sun Wu flourished, and he is credited with writing an entirely separate treatise on military matters, which was rediscovered in the same collection that gave us the earliest extant traces of the *Sun Zi*. It seems all too likely that the family name Sun, famously associated with military expertise, became attached to a growing collection of martial wisdom compiled over the course of the Warring States period. The opening of each chapter of the text with the formula ""Master Sun said:"" is paradoxically an indication that there was never a ""Master Sun"" - only a succession of authors legitimising their wisdom through his reputation. Predictably, Sun Bin was eventually credited with being a descendant of the legendary Sun Wu, whose wisdom clearly ran in the family.

The fact is that the way of recording Ancient Chinese texts, using the strips of bamboo mentioned above, is extremely conducive to this sort of textual tradition. Single strips of bamboo contain no more than one or a few lines of text; the strips are held together with string. As the string breaks or decays, texts become jumbled, with later editors often totally unable to restore them to their original order. From our point of view, it is shockingly easy for lines to be added or lost. One of the frustrating things about the *Sun Zi* is that much of its metatext - its ""next""s and ""therefore""s - don't actually make any sense, and that not enough serious philological study has been devoted to restoring the text. Given its many uncertainties, we are on far safer ground to assume that the work is the product of many hands over a long period (roughly the 4th and early 3rd centuries BC) than that it is the work of a single, legendary military genius.

So where does that leave us with regard to your question? Why was the *Sun Zi* written? Who benefitted from writing it and spreading it around?

Here we find a useful parallel in the tradition of Ancient Greek literature. In Greece, as in China, military treatises did not develop in a vaccuum, when a particular military mastermind decided to commit his wisdom to the ages. Rather, they began to appear in an era that saw a general shift in notions of learning, in which oral tradition and abstract thought began to gave way to practical written works that allowed knowledge in discreet fields of expertise to be replicated and taught. In Greece, as in China, the art of war was swept up in this movement by the conditions of the age: in Greece, the hegemonic wars of the Classical period (of which the Peloponnesian War seems to have been especially important as a driving force), and in China, the prolonged and devastating Warring States period. In both cultures, the earliest written works of philosophy had appeared some time before, and kickstarted a tradition of recording advanced thought for the benefit of others. It is not surprising to find Chinese catalogues grouping the *Sun Zi* in the Daoist (that is, philosophical) tradition. It and the many other military treatises that appeared soon after all fit into the same new approach to the spread of knowledge. The purpose of the text was to teach, so that future generations facing military problems would not have to reinvent the wheel.

535,AskHistorians,"Was painful Acne ever an issue in WW2? If I slept in the dirt for weeks between ages 17-22, I'd have breakouts constantly. Is Hollywood's portrayal of dirty--yet unblemished--soldiers accurate, or do we have photos, documentation to show otherwise?","Man, oh man, Suffice to say, finding sources on a niche topic like this were NOT easy, but they do exist! At least a few Dermatologic studies were published after the war and I was able to find a few of them, both of which focus on Acne in the Pacific Theater. While prior to the war acne was considered a nuisance more than something serious, American servicemen in the Pacific were found to be developing what came to be called ""tropical acne"", an extreme manifestation of the condition that could be physically debilitating and symptoms of which included ""large pustules, draining sinuses and extensive, disfiguring scars,frequently [keloidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid)"". To be sure, it isn't that the breakouts themselves were being caused by the men simply being in the Pacific - the studies indicate that a history of acne previous to service was a major factor - but various factors from the wartime environment, including ""increase in vasomotor activity, caused by the heat, plus the inadequate toilet facilities"" all contributed to severely affect men who had been sent to the Pacific. Being unable to clean, minor outbreaks could become infected, and many cases seem to have been serious enough that that the afflicted men were unable to continue serving on the front and had to be evacuated for more medical treatment, and many declared permanently unfit for duty.

Not all men who suffered breakouts were necessarily suffering from such acute symptoms though, and all in all, acne seems to have been one of the more common issues soldiers in the Pacific theater faced. As far as dermatological issues, at least, it was second only to tropical skin disease/fungal infections, with somewhere between 20 to 30 percent of all patients hospitalized for skin issues suffering from tropical acne.

As far as treatment goes, doctors found that standard treatments were generally quite ineffective and remaining in tropical conditions would generally cause a worsening. Attempts to use penicillin showed little real result while evacuation to cooler environments alone could cause real improvement in the condition, so that seems to have been the standard procedure.

So in short, someone else can weigh in on other theaters, but at least in the Pacific, Acne was a serious issue faced.

Edit: I was able to find one other source, which doesn't add to much to what has been said here beyond the [small addition here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/69dal7/was_painful_acne_ever_an_issue_in_ww2_if_i_slept/dh63f6r/) but does note that as far as the European theater goes ""[acne] was a condition of no consequence"".

536,AskHistorians,Sir Ian McKellen came out as gay on BBC Radio 30 years ago today. What was the reaction like in the UK and the US?,"You can listen to the BBC Radio 3 discussion where McKellen publically came out [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/gay_rights/12012.shtml), in conversation with the (very conservative) editor of the *Telegraph*, Peregrine Worsthorne. The first discussion of McKellen's coming out I can find is [a profile of McKellen in the British newspaper *The Independent* from February 20th, 1988](http://www.mckellen.com/writings/activism/880220independent.htm), which is preserved on Ian McKellen's webpage as his writing (which it clearly is not). McKellen's coming out is portrayed as political activism in opposition to 'Clause 28', mooted legislation forbidding local governments to promote the idea that homosexual relationships might be normal. McKellen became involved in activism against Clause 28 in early January. Maybe one could say that the future Gandalf was trying to tell parliamentarians: you shall not pass...this bill. (Despite McKellen's activism, it became law in May)

According to the summary of McKellen's activism about Clause 28 in the *Independent* article:

>On Sunday, 24 January, he walked on stage and on to television screens at the Laurence Olivier Awards. ""The greatest surprise"", says one of the invited audience, ""was the roar of approval that greeted him when he mentioned Clause 28"". The next day he shepherded a host of stars, and one baby, on stage at the Playhouse, before journalists and Lords bussed down the Embankment for the occasion. The radio and television blitz followed, and by the end of the week homosexuality and censorship were issues of national interest in a way unknown since the late Sixties.  

>To achieve this, McKellen played a very private card. One friend describes it: ""Coming out is the essence of gay liberation, and Ian understands that. There are only two or three other working actors who have done it, because it is dangerous. But he knew it was time to stand up and be counted."" Though he described himself as gay in a World Service programme on 19 January, the declaration was made to most of Britain on Radio 3's Third Ear, on 27 January.

>The occasion was a spirited argument with Peregrine Worsthorne. It provoked a remark about ""disgusting homosexual practices"" from the editor of the Sunday Telegraph, and a query laden with innocence from McKellen: did Mr Worsthorne mean the Garrick when he spoke about gay clubs? The following Sunday's leader did the Stop Clause 28 campaign no harm at all.

Unfortunately, the archives of the London *Telegraph* do not appear to go back more than 20 years, and Peregrine Worsthorne's response to McKellen's coming out in his paper is not accessible online as far as I can tell.

Additionally, McKellen wrote a piece for [*Capital Gay* magazine summarising his rather eventful 1988](http://www.mckellen.com/activism/activism_coming_out.htm). In it, he essentially claims that his homosexuality was not particularly a surprise to anyone in his life, given the theatrical circles he moved in:

>That I had actually come out probably surprised me more than my being gay can have shocked any listener who knew my work. Indeed, some of them have written to say that they'd known I was gay for years and couldn't care less. When I told my step-mother, soon after, she said the same. My friends had always known; so had my fellow actors, because backstage there are few secrets. But I'd always avoided saying I was gay to the media - even to the gay press - insisting that my private life was my own. My complacency had involved nothing more embarrassing than the occasional white lie about not being married - I was never, though, one to talk about looking for the right girl and relishing parenthood.

In terms of reaction in the US, the first mention I can find on Factiva is a reference in the *Boston Globe* to McKellen, in April 1988, winning the Norton Award for the best achievements in Boston-area theatre, for his one-man show, 'Ian McKellen Acting Shakespeare'. Giving a speech, accepting the award, according to a *Boston Globe* story by Jeff McLaughlin:

>With regard to the denouement of McKellen's remarks -- in which he recounted his decision to publicly acknowledge his homosexuality and work for tolerance and rights for gay people in Britain -- not even Elliot Norton knew what was coming. Norton said, in a Wednesday note, that McKellen had asked for at least 20 minutes to speak, but did not discuss his topic beforehand. ""But he had planned it,"" Norton wrote, ""to the point of writing out his whole talk and, in the half hour or so before the ceremony, studying part of it before a dressing-room mirror.""

>McKellen's speech may well approach historic status, and it certainly will become part of Boston theater folklore, since no one had thought ahead of time to set up a tape recorder.

One journalist's reference to McKellen from the point of view of someone not particularly inclined towards progressive views came from a review of the TV documentary Open Space on BBC2; Martin Cropper in *The Times* said of *Open Space* that:

>Open Space (BBC2) illustrated the condition [of homosexuality] with some predictable examples: the 'spanking judge', for instance, who resigned his recordership after exposure in the tabloids; the 'out' lesbian who enlisted in the Wrens specifically to meet like-minded adults, without realizing that the armed forces are the only sphere where such activity has ever been illegal. The most intelligent comment was Ian McKellen's plea for respectable homosexuals to help erode prejudice by declaring themselves publically - a move which would, however, posit a different society.

>As one has come to expect from access-television, the historical perspective was on the flimsy side. In this country at least, the 'homophobic' backlash started years before Aids had been heard of, for the obvious reason that some 'straights' had had it to here with the hectoring aggression of homosexual propaganda.

Another reference to Ian McKellen discussing his homosexuality comes from an article in the *Sunday Times* about the filming of a ITV Phil Donahue special (i.e., with the American talk show host filming a British version of the show): 

>On Wednesday the subject was clause 28. On the panel were two straights, Sir Rhodes Boyson and the Rev David Rushworth-Smith, and two gay actors, Ian McKellen and Michael Cashman, who plays Colin in EastEnders. Noisy claques in the audience booed Boyson and the vicar, and cheered the actors.

>Donahue had been told that the reserved British would never speak out; luckily many present were Americans who can utter words like ``sexuality'' without a blush.

>The debate goes like this. A fat woman is horrified to be surrounded by these homosexuals; a pigtailed young man says he's heterosexual but live and let live; a lesbian mother with two teenage children is rounded on by a man in favour of ""the normal family unit''; Donahue asks who is to say what is normal? And so on. When Boyson says, ""God created man and woman'' and McKellen rejoins, ""and together they created a homosexual'' such a sequitur is rare.

>A grey-haired English woman declares with dignity, ""I am the mother of a gay son'', but we hear no more from her: it is time for a commercial break. After it, Donahue has found another old lady. She says: ""People who are born like that, it's like being a cripple isn't it? I mean they can't help it] Well, it's sad they're born, isn't it?''

>Nobody in the audience knows whether to laugh or cry.

Ian McKellen was not the first theatre actor to come out as gay, as Simon Callow had come out in a book he wrote in 1984. In early June 1988, Callow mentions McKellen in a Diary piece written in *The Times*:

>The latest such event has been inspired by that fumbling piece of legislation, Clause 28 of the Local Government Bill. To raise money for the possible victims of the clause, an extraordinary group of artists Simon Rattle, Dame Judi Dench, Mike Gambon and many others across the spectrum of the performing arts are appearing at the Piccadilly theatre this Sunday. The event has been largely inspired and organized by Ian McKellen. It was his cheeky notion to call the show Promoting Homosexuality (echoing the ambiguous phrasing of the clause itself) but the intention behind the show is not polemical; it simply represents the anxiety of a large number of performers about a piece of law that affects us all.

Elsewhere, most of the references to Ian McKellen in Factiva from 1988 refer to his career continuing as per usual, which makes me suspect that nobody into theatre in England (or Boston) in the 1980s was enormously surprised, or cared particularly that a leading actor was gay; he starred as (the heterosexual) Profumo in the 1989 film *Scandal*. Ultimately, McKellen was knighted by the Queen in 1991; coming out in 1988 didn't stop him from symbolically being admitted to the establishment.

Nonetheless, anti-homosexual prejudice in the wake of the AIDS epidemic had a support base within the Conservative Party, not least with Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, who in a 1987 conference speech said that ""Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay...all of those children are being cheated of a sound start in life. Yes, cheated!"" Clause 28 remained on the books until the Labor government voted it out in March 2003. 

McKellen relates in the *Capital Gay* piece discussed Clause 28 with Tories at Westminister: 

>At Westminster, I met our lawmakers — and remembered their words: The Minister — ""I don't understand why young homosexuals need their own clubs — why can't they mix with everybody else of their own age?""  The Whip in the Commons — ""I'm sorry about Section 28 — it's just a bit of red meat thrown to our right-wing wolves.""  The Whip in the Lords — ""I'm sorry about Section 28 — but you appreciate my job is just to get our chaps to vote the right way.""

537,AskHistorians,"Tomorrow, 152 years ago, John Wilkes Booth walked unseen into President Lincoln's personal booth, took out a pistol, shot him, and managed to escape even after breaking his leg. Why did Lincoln have seemingly no personal security and how did it compare to other world leaders at the time?","The Warren Commission formed after the assassination of President Kennedy produced [this appendix](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html) on the history of presidential protection. They note that before Lincoln, ""there was remarkably little concern about the safety of Presidents and few measures were taken to protect them."" This persisted even after President Jackson survived an assassination attempt due to a misfiring gun. In the 1840s Congress did assign a guard to the White House — but apparently with more of an aim to protecting the building and grounds than its primary occupant. 

During the Civil War Lincoln was guarded irregularly — sometimes by Washington, D.C. policemen, and sometimes by Army units. Lincoln ""was reluctant to surround himself with guards and often rejected protection or sought to slip away from it."" This, the report notes, ""has been characteristic of almost all American Presidents.""

The congressional report after Lincoln's assassination, ""with traditional reluctance, called for no action to provide better protection for the President in the future."" The Warren Commission notes that some people at the time saw Lincoln's assassination as a unique reflection of the Civil War, which was now over, and not something indicative of a need for broader protections. Indeed, for more than a decade after Booth, presidents continued to walk about in public alone and unguarded. (I remember, but cannot find a source, an anecdote about either Grant or Hayes, that upon receiving a threat on his life, the president didn't change his routine other than to purchase a heavier walking stick. Sadly, you should disregard this anecdote unless someone else can find a source for it, but it's delightful enough I thought I'd mention it as an aside.)

After President Garfield was shot, the New York Tribune contrasted ""the simple Republican manner of life which the custom of nearly a century has prescribed for the Chief Magistrate of the United States"" with ""the forms and safeguards of courts"" — implying that bodyguards were seen as a courtly, monarchical affectation, where as a republican president should be open and accessible to the people (July 3, 1881, quoted in Warren Commission report). Surprisingly or not, despite the second assassination of a president in two decades, Congress ""took no steps to provide the President with personal protection.""

The Secret Service, initially a group for combatting counterfeiters and financial crimes, first began providing part-time presidential protection in 1894 — apparently a coincidence because a group of Colorado gamblers were suspected of plotting to assassinate President Cleveland. President McKinley actually had Secret Service protection when he was assassinated, but it was his death that finally spurred Congress to give the Secret Service ""full-time responsibility for the safety of the President.""

Returning to Lincoln, he was certainly aware that many people wanted to kill him. President Theodore Roosevelt later quoted Lincoln saying, ""Though it would be safer for a president to live in a cage, it would interfere with his business."" He had sporadic guards but no formal protection.

Fascinatingly, General Ulysses Grant was originally invited to attend Ford's Theater with Lincoln on that fatal night. He begged off with an excuse about needing to be with his children, but [possibly because Julia Grant and Mary Todd Lincoln hated each other](https://featherfoster.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/mary-lincolns-rivals/). 

From a [recent biographical article on Grant](https://www.damninteresting.com/the-reconstruction-of-ulysses-s-grant/):

> Grant would never forgive himself for begging off, certain that had he accepted the invitation, his bodyguards stationed outside the door would have stopped Booth. **As lieutenant general of the U.S. Army he was entitled to armed protection around the clock. The president in those days was not.**

Hopefully this was helpful!"

#I Don't Want to Read All That Below. Tell Me The Most Important Things

Normally I save this for the end, but to put it up front instead, trust me when I say that if we thought it would work, we would implement it. If nothing else it would get y'all to stop asking! We really do take it seriously though, and probably once a year, at least, we have a discussion on the matter to see whether anything has changed from the reasons explained below, but for better or for worse, little does.

But while 'Answered' flair might not be in play, we do our best to provide several alternatives to give users the best browsing experience we can, and to enjoy as much content as possible. 

* Every thread has a Remind Me Bot link pre-filled and stickied to the top. Click than, and you just need to send the PM. Easy-peasy, fire and forget, and you'll be reminded to come back in a day or two when an answer is much more likely there.
* Last year, we were super psyched to be able to roll out [our very own browser extension](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/d6dzi7/tired_of_clicking_to_find_only_removed_comments/) with the help of a wonderful community member, which we highly encourage using to view the 'real' comment count in a thread.
* We also encourage subscribing to the '[Weekly Roundup](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&subject=askhistorians+weekly&message=x)' provided by /u/subredditsummarybot to get a summary of the top content each week right to your inbox.
* The moderators also maintain several places that we feature the best content, including [Twitter](https://twitter.com/askhistorians), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/askhistorians/), the [Sunday Digest](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?q=title%3A%22Sunday+Digest%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all), and the [Best Of Awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ABest%2BOf).\

We hear a lot of suggestions for things to change about the subreddit. Some are easy enough to reject, others we give serious thought to, and occasionally, we get a really good one that helps us develop changes for the subreddit. But by far there is no suggestion we hear more than the request that we implement ""Answered"" flair, which is something that we, perhaps infamously, have not done despite this. 

While it is a suggestion that seems self-evident to many, unfortunately, it isn't quite so straightforward an idea. And while we aren't opposed to it per se, we are opposed to implementation of such a scheme in a way that wouldn't be fair and equitable in application, not to mention something which can be administered easily and in a uniform manner. As such, there are a number of impediments, both practical and philosophical, that prevent us from putting such a flair into effect.

###There is Rarely *One* Answer

One of the biggest issues facing such a scheme comes down to the historical method itself. Different historians can look at the same evidence, and come to different conclusions. Neither one is necessarily invalid, and the debate between those competing positions can tell us just as much about a topic as the answers themselves, sometimes more even as it can help suss out details and thoughts on the process itself. In a space such as these, we generally do *not* want to endorse one perspective over another. Ideally, an answer on a topic which is subject to hot debate within the academy should make that clear enough itself, but we, as moderators, not only don't want to take sides there, but we simply *shouldn't* be seen as favoring one academic interpretation over another. 

Just as we remove comments in a thread because of how the first comment, whatever its quality, can so often become the 'hot' comment of a thread, we likewise don't want to be crediting as 'answered' a thread because the first comment which meets the rules has arrived. Put simply, we aren't endorsing *anything* here as the definitive answer. Responses which are not removed meet certain criteria which reflect fidelity to the historical method, but history is a process, and rarely do we end up with so definitive a picture that we can reject *any and all* alternatives with certainty.

####Stifling of Contributions

Closely tied into this is what such a flair would potentially do to the quality of content in the subreddit. We aren't simply speculating, but know well from many discussions with Flaired contributors, that the presence of ""Answered"" flair on a thread would make them less inclined to contribute further. An answer in the thread might be *decent* and just enough to justify being left up, but there is a ton more to say, or another important angle to offer. With 'Answered' flair there is simply less incentive to do so. It gives the thread a sense of finality that disincentives further contributions. 

####Workflow of Moderation

Moderating is often like being a grad student TA, assigned to a class that isn't actually in your focus. We can evaluate a lot about an answer using general principles of the historical method. We can consider the construction of the arguments, and how well the piece communicates its information. We can check sources and see whether they a) exist b) are well reviewed and c) make mention of the topics at hand. But we aren't *all* experts on *everything*. Between the whole team, we have an incredibly wide coverage, but we necessarily must do triage at times.

Say a question about 12th century France is posted. I, knowing nothing about the topic, can evaluate an answer on the criteria noted above, and decide is passes the smell test. Or maybe I think there is *something* fishy, but can't quite put my finger on it, but either way, I decide that there isn't justification for removal based on my reading *but* in either case, while not removing it, I'll flag it to the attention of the mod team's medievalists to have a look. When they are able to, they will also give it a look. Maybe they decide it is fine. But maybe they pick up on something that I wouldn't be aware of. From *there*, we have several approaches. If bad enough, obviously, we'll remove and warn the user. If it is missing something major, we might remove it with a DM explaining the issue and suggestions on how to fix it after which we review to reinstate. Or maybe the issue is kind of in that grey area, in which case we would leave it up *for now* but with some pointed follow-up question to try and suss out a bit more from the user, and only remove if their response indicates that they are already past the extent of their knowledge.

So the question is... at what point does the ""Answered"" flair go up? Is it when I first decide ""smells OK""? But it might still be removed later! Is it after the 'in-field' mod makes their first assessment? Still might be removed depending on the latter stages. For some cases, it can easily be several stages over 24 hours for a response is *definitely* there to stay. Even beyond standard workflow, there are plenty of other things that might happen. Perhaps it turns out a response was plagiarized, so must be removed. Perhaps a respondent refuses to provide sources after request, so must be removed. And of course, because it was originally noted as ""answered"", other potential respondents already decided not to bother!

####Mechanics of the Flair

Even if we are able to work through all of those issues, which is easier said than done, just how is this being applied? In the end, it needs to be applied manually by the mods. Although there are ways that flair can be automated with bots, those are ""dumb"" solutions, which is to say, a bot can know there is a comment in the thread with at least 700 words or something, but it can't know if they are *good* words.

Likewise, although the creator of a thread can add flair themselves, beyond the fact that it isn't something we can assume will be done consistently, it also isn't up to the OP to judge the quality of the response as it is in some other subreddits such as /r/AskHistory. A response may be posted, they may read it and add the flair before a mod sees it... only for the mod to quickly see glaring issues that might not be obvious to a layperson, but utterly sink the quality from a more informed view.

So in the end, it would have to be something the mod team does manually, only after evaluation of an answer. This places a burden on us beyond what we already carry, as it creates a number of pressures, including to act quicker than we currently do, and also to be more accurate in our assessments of answers than we already are.

539,AskHistorians,"Now that it's been a few months with the JFK Assassination Files being released, is there anything we didn't already know? Anything groundbreaking?","While I certainly hope you were being glib with your Oliver Stone comment, the short answer to your question is: ""Not much."" There certainly was no information that changed the official narrative of the assassination; though there were a lot of intriguing new bits of information about the case, and semi-unrelated cases.

The Washington Post did an absolutely terrific breakdown of the most notable revelations here:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/national/jfk-assassination-files/?utm_term=.2937d722401c

Probably the most notable, at least from my perspective, were documents detailing some of the various CIA plans and plots to kill Castro. This, of course, has long been known, but this particular document (the first one listed in the Washington Post piece) is an official 1975 internal examination of all the efforts and fleshes out the various plots in much greater detail than was ever known before.

The 82 page memo refers to another, unpublished 1967 memo by J. Edgar Hoover with the absolutely wonderfully title of ""Central Intelligence Agency's Intentions to Send Hoodlums to Cuba to Assassinate Castro."" This, of course, speaks to the intra-agency conflicts between the FBI and the CIA on matters related to Cuba.

But your question is ""is there anything in these files that provides any type of indication of a conspiracy in the JFK assasination?"" and the answer is, ""No."" The whole release dominated the news cycle for what, about a day? The level of revelations--dominated by interesting but not particularly revelatory minutiae--seems to indicate that this was about the appropriate level of general interest.

Keep in mind that at the very last moment, Donald Trump elected to withhold numerous documents for further vetting. So until those specific documents are released, we are looking at a subset of all of the information still contained in the archives."
540,AskHistorians,"Despite representing only 4.4 percent of the world's population, the U.S houses 22 percent of its prisoners. What are the historical reasons for the U.S's incredibly large prison population?","During the campaign and subsequent presidency of Nixon, much of his rhetoric revolved around two things in particular - crime and drugs/drug use. Nixon was the progenitor of the War on Drugs and even coined the term (although Reagan would supercharge it during his time in office).

Nixon's presidency is the time where academics begin to refer to a period defined by 'mass incarceration', where we started to heavily enforce and criminalize drug offences, particularly marijuana. Behind such efforts was forms of racist pandering, often seen as a backlash to the Civil Rights and Black Power movements. We can see this particularly when it comes to drug usage, as the Nixon administration sought to associate African-Americans with drug use in order to excuse the criminalization and policing of their leaders and communities. We see this in particular with the infamous quote from Nixon's top domestic advisor, John Ehrlichman:

*""The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”*¹

Nixon himself wasn't above racial remarks either. In a taped recording, he stated in regards to marijuana legalization supporters: *""You know, it's a funny thing, every one of the bastards that are out for legalizing marijuana are Jewish. What the Christ is the matter with the Jews, Bob? What is the matter with them?""*²

During this time, there was even a commission appointed by Nixon to study the effects of Marijuana (as the Controlled Substances Act was being authored). However, when the commission found the cannabis use did not present a danger to society as the administration often presented, it was ignored. 

Fast forwarding to Reagan, and we see the kickstarting of the conservative legal philosophy commonly known today as 'tough-on-crime'. It advocated for harsher criminal penalties for those convicted of a crimes (particularly violent crimes and drug offenses). Mandatory minimum sentences were established, forcing those convicted of a crime to have to serve a specific period of time for that crime (in the Clinton years this would be followed by 'truth in sentencing' laws that made those convicted of a crime have t serve a signficant portion (85%) of their sentence before being eligible for parole). Criminal penalties for drug offenses were increased heavily, particularly with the Drug Abuse Act of '86. This law also introduced penalties for crack cocaine possession, which were far harsher than for powder cocaine (something often regarded as a way to unfairly discriminate against African-American). This particular way of thinking in regards to crime lasted through Bush Sr.'s presidency.

From the period of 1970 to 1994, the prison population increased exponentially - from around 200,000 in 1970 to 1.5 million in 1994. Without a doubt, this trend was guided by the actions that the federal government took during this time in regards to how it handled crime, drug use and dependency, as well as race relations.

**Part 1 - Background in Understanding Buddhism and its Visual Aesthetics**

---

&nbsp;


Firstly, I find the question somewhat problematic in discussing Buddhism and its ideals. Without going into too much detail and losing focus on the main question at hand, it's crucial to discuss how popular western understanding of Buddhism is heavily built upon the work of Buddhist propagation in the 20th century. In the 1900's onwards, Buddhism would begin to truly take hold in Europe and America as a practice, where previously knowledge of the religion (and I do say religion, this is a wholly separate and complicated argument and matter which we will not explore not) mostly came from explorers, missionaries, historians, and philosophers. Theravadin Buddhism occupied the most interest in the first half of the 20th century, accessible due to colonial presence in Theravadin countries. With Japan's defeat in World War II, Zen came to be truly globalized. Tibetan traditions also have a notable presence, greatly due to the political situation of the Chinese invasion of Tibet and the Dalai Lama's subsequent flight and advocacy work. A second wave of immigration from Southeast Asia can be credit from -political, economic, and social instability, prompting growing communities of Vietnamese Mahayanan and Southeast Theravadin traditions.

Why do I mention all this? Because the practice of Buddhism in the west is noticeably different than in Asia. Whereas Western Buddhism heavily focuses on and specializes in meditation and contemplation, the various kinds of Buddhism in Asia treat the religion on a much more intimate, everyday, and cultural level. In the same manner a churchgoer interacts with the community through practice, ritual, holidays, etc, the Buddhist in Asia does not only focus on the dharma, but the relationship with the laity and the monastic. Historically, the monks were the vanguard of the tradition, and they served the community by offering the spiritual, moral, ethical, ritual, educational guidance. Laypersons were observers and offered whatever was necessary to sustain the monastery. The differences in proportion of layperson to monk in the west and east must also be highlighted. Fewer ordained and qualified teachers in the west means the entire practice of Buddhism needed to change, and the monk-layperson relationship drastically adapted to new conditions.

As such, there have been efforts to alter, deemphasis, and deminish the religious and worship aspects of Buddhism, to be compatible with spiritual trends and social circumstances of the mid to late 20th century. We must understand that Christianity's overwhelming historical presence in Europe and America has heavily impacted society and culture. Alternative options to the dominant norm are always sought after, and Buddhism is one of them. This was especially the case in the 20th century, with the growth of New Religion Movements and a tendency to look towards Asia as a guide for spirituality. This further shapes how Buddhism is to be shared and taught with a different kind of audience. (This is why we also see differences today with American Buddhism and Ethnic Buddhism, the kind practiced by ethnic and immigrant communities.) Meditation and personal insight as a means to achieve liberation and spiritual cultivation is a major focus accessible to the laity in America and Europe. It is not just something reserved for the dedicated monks, the common layperson can participate too. And this is compatible with western conditions, as Buddhism offers a path that isn't in servitude towards a God or higher being, but rather, the personal self. This is why we might mainly focus on or understand the dharma and its ideas as concepts such as the paramitas and the Four Noble Truths. It is also critical to distinguish *detachment* from *asceticism*, which is something discussed in the Middle Way and cautioned by the Buddha. Asceticism is an extreme, not encouraged in Buddhism. However, there are historical instances of intensive devotional acts, but this cannot be considered the norm. The lifestyle of the monastic is certainly rigid, restrained, and intense, but ascetic is somewhat of a misleading term.

To return to my main point here, Buddhism in the east and west are engaged and understood differently. We may understand parts of the dharma as removing attachment, reliance, craving, towards material and impermanent things. These elements, of course, aren't neglected in Asia, but the Buddha and other Buddhist figures represent other ideas of wisdom, salvation, guidance, and meaning. This is why you may find gilded figurines and statues in Tibet and Southeast Asia. Why the offering of merit is so crucial to Burmese society. Why temple goers regularly prey and offer incense in China. Simply put, aesthetics, images, and physical, consumable, and tangible things help one to understand and engage with Buddhism. This is effected by, effects, and intermingles with culture of whichever society Buddhism is in. Ostentatious art is just a natural result of this.

**Part 2a - Answering the Main Question, On Statues and Grandiosity**

---

&nbsp;


Okay, so now that we somewhat understand why some arts and aesthetics of Buddhism may be fanciful and extravagant, why are Buddhist statues so darn big?

We must explore this by dividing time between the pre-modern and modern world. Firstly, we can consider the ancient world and earlier Buddhism. I will try to create a narrative from three examples, Central Asia, China, and Japan, each relying on the preceding civilization with the transmission of Buddhism and its art and practices.

Buddhism originated in the Northern India/Nepal region, and made its way south and west. Buddhism would take an immense hold in Gandhara/Central Asia, up until the great social changes of Islamic conquest. As such, Buddhism spread through the Silk Road, and would be impacted by other ideas with it. Alexander's conquests brought the importance of Hellenistic culture to Persia, Central Asia, India, and China. This is significant as the Greco-Roman valuing of the human figure would dramatically influence art in the aforementioned regions. There is some debate in art history regarding the significance and impact of cultures on one another, though. Large statues of human-like and animal figures existed in Egypt and the Achaemenid Empire. Subjects can vary, be it royalty, rulers, deities, or other mythological figures. Nevertheless, it could be fair to suggest that Hellenistic, Egyptian, and Persian aesthetic values had some impact on Central Asia.

This is why the Bamyan Statues, destroyed in 2001 by the Taliban, are/were such important examples of early Buddhist art. Previously, depictions of the Buddha and other Buddhist figures in the Gandharan region might take form in stupas and statues, but those would not exceed 10m/33ft in height. The larger Buddha in Bamiyan was 53m/174ft in height, while the smaller was 35m/115ft. Not only that, the famous monk-traveler Xuanzang describes them as to be decorated with precious stones and gold. These large statues would be an imposing and awe-inspiring site, one highly praised by residents and visitors alike. It would also represent the devotion of the people, the power of the ruler, and the admiration and respect followers would have towards the Buddha."
544,AskHistorians,"Hitler won control of the Nazi party with an *almost* unanimous 553-1 vote. Is it known what happened to the guy behind the ""1""? Did he survive Hitler's rule? Why was he such a contrarian?","Ok, so as far as I can tell the vote was anonymous, thus the problem is that we might never know who did not vote for Hitler in that meeting.

When reviewing the fragmentary early membership lists of the NSDAP, there are a few possibilities who could have voted against Hitler but the most likely is Anton Drexler.

Drexler was one of the  founders of the NSDAP (then named Deutsche Arbeiter Partei, German Workers' Party, DAP) in 1919 and Hitler's main rival for party chairman in 1921. Drexler who had been the second chair of the party had taken over first chair in 1920 when his predecessor Karl Harrer resigned over conflicts with Hitler. A similar fate awaited Drexler, who was unable to mount any serious resistance to Hitler. Hitler had parctically become indispensable for the party by 1921 because of his success as an orator and he guarded that role as well as what he understood as ideological purity of the movement jealously.

In 1920 and 21 the NSDAP was plagued by a shortage of money and by being one among the many völkisch movements in Germany. To alleviate both of these problems, they attempted to merge with other, similar, parties such as the DSP and the Deutsche Werksgemeinschaft. Hitler opposed this because it threatened his supremacy in the party, so he used his own role as leverage. Successfully crashing the DSP negotiations, he attempted the same in connection with the DWG negations but failed and so, in a fit of rage, he threatened to resign several times in 1920 and 1921. Every time, fearing the loss of their popular orator and really, the only thing that set them apart form the dime a dozen völisch parties in Germany, the NSDAP leadership placated Hitler by giving him what he wanted.

Again sent to to convince Hitler not to resign, Drexler asked him in July 1921 what he wanted. Hitler demanded chairmanship and extraordinary powers within the party. While Drexler and Hitler showed their unity on July 1926, Drexler as the current chairman was obviously the choice for those who opposed Hitler within the party and there seem to have been at least some because according to Ian Kershaw, 3000 anonymous pamphlets attacking Hitler had been prepared by the time, the members' meeting rolled around.

So, it might have been Drexler who voted against Hitler, possibly expecting a victory of himself, which obviously didn't pan out. Drexler left the NSDAP when it was dissolved after the Hitler Putsch and only rejoined in 1933 never again to gain any kind of political role until his death in 1942.

Other possibilities include Gottfired Feder, prominent member of the anti-Capitalist movement within the NSDAP, who later served in minor roles in the Nazi adminsitration; the first chairman, Harrer, though it is unknown if he was even there (he died of natural causes in 1926); or one of the lesser known early members about whom little information can be found such as Hans Baumann or Karl Beggel; or it could have been Hitler himself following convention in some parties of abstaining to vote for himself though given his personality that seems rather unlikely. In the end, it probably is not possible to find out with any kind of certainty.

Edit: Apparently, Robert Payne claims that the dissenting vote came from a man called Rudolf Posch, a party member and librarian (who is not to be confused with the Austrian Social Democrat of the same name). I have no idea where this claim comes from. Neither Payne nor Joseph Howard Tyson who also mentions this in his book on Dietrich Eckhart have that fact footnoted, though it is likely that one of them got that fact from the other. I could go and look up his Nazi party file though according to the information in the search engine of the German Bundesarchiv it is rather thin and it seems that man never made any sort of impact on the history of the NSDAP again and what became of him is unknown.

2nd edit: for more on the conflict between Hitler and others in the party see /u/boffcheese comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5bs2hk/hitler_won_control_of_the_nazi_party_with_an/d9r1se1/)

545,AskHistorians,"The US presidential election of 1876 had the greatest voter turnout in American history, with 81.8% of the voting age population voting. What were the factors that caused such a major turnout?","Although I'll swing back to the circumstances around 1876, to start off, I'm going to turn this question on its head and look at why voter turnout *declined* in the elections following. If you look at [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/rjFrb) you can see that while 1876 was the highpoint, it wasn't exactly an anomaly, and voter turnout was consistently high in the elections preceding it. It sticks out because, although the drop wasn't *immediately* afterwards, it certainly preceded the continuing decline in voter turnout that would mark the next half-century.

So why did voting decline in that period? Well, one of the most simple reasons to look at is Jim Crow. While under Reconstruction, black men (women being generally deprived of the vote) could, for the most part, go to the polls and exercise their right to vote, this began to change after Reconstruction was ended (not to say it didn't happen before, just not as effectively), and the Redeemer governments worked through various means to disenfranchise vast swathes of voters in the American South. The effect of this can't be underrated. While in the 1876 election the South saw turnout roughly comparable to the rest of the country, at 75 percent, vote suppression methods such as literacy tests not to mention outright fraud, saw the turnout decline to 46 percent at the turn of the century. By the 1924 election, *19 percent* of those theoretically eligible to vote were actually showing up at the polls. And to be sure, while the primary target was black voters, many poorer, illiterate whites were disenfranchised too, despite ""loopholes"" to grandfather many of them in. In Louisiana, for instance, while 90 percent of black voters were barred from the polls, 60 percent of whites were as well. While Jim Crow should absolutely be understood as primarily a racial regime, it was quite oligarchical as well, with power being concentrated in the hands mostly of upper-class whites, who wanted to share it with no one.

This allows us to circle back somewhat though to look at 1876, and why it would be slightly above the average of the time though. During the Reconstruction era there were *real efforts* to mobilize poor voters of both races by the Radical Republicans. The example I'm most familiar with was that led by Mahone in Virginia whose Readjuster movement controlled the state for a brief time in the late 1870s-early'80s, propelled by populist support from a coalition of black voters and poor whites. I won't spend to much time on him as I've written about him before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6fent8/did_longstreet_and_other_confederates_really_seek/dihn6ym/?context=3) but the short of it is that in the post-war era, but before Jim Crow laws took hold, we can see a lot of political agitation that struck at the white Democratic establishment in the South that was attempting to reclaim power, and that *for a time* they enjoyed some successes. The 1876 election in particular we can look at as a watershed, with both sides of the argument over Reconstruction seeing heavy stakes. And of course Tilden won the popular vote, but lost anyways, as part of a deal that did end Reconstruction anyways. That cessation meant the evaporation of the Federal protections that allowed those insurgent political movements to compete on a roughly level playing field. Changes weren't immediate, and varied state by state - in Virginia for instance the Readjusters remained in power until 1883, when race riots days before the election were used by the Democrats to stoke voter fears - but it nevertheless meant that the suppression of the black vote and the poor white vote was able to start, a process which wasn't immediate, and took time to take full effect.

It can also be said that while Jim Crow was unique to the American South, similar political tactics were not unknown throughout the country, just in different ways. In the Northern and Western states, turnout had dropped to 55 percent by the 1920 election, after all, and while it cannot be blamed on *institutional* barriers such as those in the South, responses to political mobilization by immigrants and lower-class groups *outside* the South by political elites saw attempts at ""demobilizing what they judged to be the least desirable components of the electorate"". They may not have been legally barring them from the polls, but through the late 1800s and early 20th century, they certainly were attempting to dissuade them from showing up.

So as I have tickets for Thor at 10, and my wife is giving me *the look*, I'll wrap this up with a quick summation. In short, voter turnout in the United States was consistently fairly high up until the 1880s. The apex of turnout in 1876 isn't exactly an anomaly if we look at the turnouts in votes around it, such as 1868 at 78.1%, or 1880 at 79.4%, but it does coincide with a period in American history rife with political upheaval, not just the American South, still on the tail end of Reconstruction, but nationwide, with Populist movements in the ascendant. The end of the century, and the early 1900s, thus provide a stark contrast, as attempts both at institutional vote suppression, as well as simple 'demobilization' of cohorts of voters, lead to a decline in turnout nationwide.

546,AskHistorians,TIL that between 1857 and 1858 there was a war in Utah between the US Government and Mormon rebels that involved armed skirmishes and several massacres. What happened and why have I never heard of this before?,"During the United States' westward colonization in the 19th century, one of the most cohesive groups to take advantage of the overland trails was the Mormons (Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints), on account of persecution and violence back east. While some did go all the way to California, most overlanding Mormons settled in Utah. Pitching out in Utah Territory ought to have been a refuge/semi-independent existence for the Mormons, but then the 1849+ gold rush happened. And Utah became a necessary transit point for the flood of emigrants to California. Well, transit point and conflict zone.

Because while some emigrants found that Mormons were good to trade with, attitudes often soured very quickly in both directions. Lacking roads, wagon trains and cattle herds rumbled through whatever fields and towns stood in their way, often tearing up the seasons' crops. Mormons who remembered themselves or their ancestors being assaulted and having their property destroyed back in the Midwest, in return, saw their chance to harass emigrants under the excuse that surely they had come from Missouri, Illinois, etc. It's important to remember we are talking about settled, established colonies/territories here. When violent (to people or property) incidents happened, parties went to court--and smashed right into a harshly divided Utah administration split between local, often ecclesiastically-appointed Mormon officials and federal administrators dispatched from Washington.

Basically, *no one* was happy. Emigrants felt they could not get justice from Mormon juries. Mormon officials believed federal delegates were overriding their sovereignty and territory rights. U.S.-sent officials complained that the LDS Church could and did essentially override their own decisions.

And in the 1850s, this concept of popular sovereignty had a peculiar importance in American politics that you might be more familiar with under the phrase ""states' rights""--that is, it needed to serve as a code word, in the politics of President James Buchanan's Democratic party, for the defense of *slavery*. Mormon theological opinions--namely, polygamy--couldn't be allowed to tarnish the image of a seen-as-necessary principle. 

With the complaints from Good Protestant Overlanders and fleeing federal officials combined with darkening attitudes towards Mormons and Mormonism as politically damaging, Buchanan by fiat declared a new (non-Brigham Young) governor of Utah and sent a cadre of troops as combination police officers/bodyguards in 1857. Young and the Mormon leadership either did not get this memo or had reasonable experience on which to believe this memo was a purposeful deception: they saw the incoming troops as an invasion force meant to impose martial law and renew persecution of Mormons. So they called up *their* own militia, prepared for doomsday scenarios, and *forbid Mormon residents from dealing with or aiding non-Mormon overlanders.*

As to why the Utah Expedition/Utah War is less often discussed, of course there are the general platitudes like ""you can only study so much in one history class"" ""not enough people were killed to make it a significant war"" ""the U.S. soldiers were kind of wimpy and when the '57-58 winter was bad they kinda just gave up and went home."" But to investigate more specifically to the historical context, I'd like to focus on one brutal event within the time frame of the Utah War: the Mountain Meadows Massacre.

Like other emigrant groups before them, the Baker-Fancher wagon train (named for its leader-organizers, John Baker and Alexander Fancher) out of Arkansas had counted on being able to wheel and deal with Mormon shopkeepers for supplies before they headed through mountains and desert. Not under the new apocalypse-coming statues of the LDS community, though. Frustrated, the Fancher party did two things. First, they stopped to camp at Mountain Meadows pass in southern Utah to rest and consolidate for the weary trip ahead in the face of fewer supplies than they had planned for. Second, they talked a massively violent rhetorical game against the Mormons. *Not only* were they going to give the Mormons trouble, *not only* were the incoming U.S. army troops going to give the Mormons even more trouble, *but*--the clincher--people in the Fancher party ""knew people"" who had oppressed the Mormons right out of Missouri, or maybe--some bragged--maybe they had *been* those people.

Local militia leaders Isaac Haight and John Lee were not about to let this slide. They determined to attack the wagon train while they were camped. They were evil-crafty about it, too--they paid a group of Paiute Indians in cattle to participate in the initial attack in September 1857. 

But Lee in particular wasn't satisfied with a few deaths in a skirmish. With the terrified Fanchers huddled down where they could defend themselves but not actually escape (and the threat of winter--and not being able to pass the mountains--looming), he went in to negotiate their surrender. Children and the wounded would leave first, in wagons; women and older children next; finally the men would walk out.

But Lee didn't mean ""surrender,"" he meant ""lambs to the slaughter."" The Mormon soldiers massacred the entire wagon train. Only a handful of very young children were allowed to survive (they were kidnapped/adopted by Mormon families). 

Historians have called this the worst event in Mormon history, which you might expect from historians. But the Mormons knew it at the time, too. Heck, they knew it in advance, which is why Lee and Haight worked so hard to get the Paiutes to participate in the initial attack. And while white Mormons were responsible for the brutal massacre, Paiute participation gave them the opening to claim Indian responsibility for ""yet another"" wagon train attack. (As John Unruh demonstrated so categorically, the actual ""Indian threat"" to overlanders was borderline nil, and our stereotypes today are the result of pop culture tropes and rumors already current in the 1840s).

The interesting thing, though, is that blaming the Paiutes didn't work quite as neatly as Haight and especially Lee might have hoped. So the Mormon leadership, desperate to avoid being implicated in triggering the slaughter, turned Mountain Meadows into a pinpoint-local event instead. They offered up Lee as the scapegoat--he was excommunicated in 1870 and *executed* in 1877. Well, America's gossip mill loves a good gory bad guy making a bad end, which quieted things on the ""back east"" and government ends. And it's not like the Utah government was raring to make ""the worst event in Mormon history"" a topic of major discussion.

Nicely illustrative of how the Massacre slid out of historical memory is the fate of its physical commemoration through memorials and historic markers. In 1859, with the massacre still a fresh memory *and* knowledge of white domination of its perpetration bleedingly fresh, U.S. military officials (!) set up a massive monument at Mountain Meadows. Brigham Young himself apparently oversaw its destruction just months later. The U.S. rebuilt it; the Mormons destroyed it again.

In 1932, with Utah now a nice state and the LDS Church itself not directly involved in government in the same way as the territory days, the state historic commission determined to build a marker. Except...they basically hid it behind rocks several miles from the road, so no one would *actually* see it. To make things even worse: Juanita Brooks' 1950 book *The Mountain Meadows Massacre*, the first scholarly investigation of the event which laid much of the blame at the feet of Young and the LDS hierarchy, triggered two reactions. First, quietly, the LDS church undid Lee's excommunication very posthumously, recognizing that the extent to which he had been scapegoated was wrong. Second, also quietly, the church *bought the land where the 1932 marker was*--and razed it.

And as James Loewen discovered in his investigations for *Lies Across America*, as late as 1990, the ""new, improved"" marker firmly in U.S. government control still stated:

* ""The company of emigrants...*was attacked*"" [passive voice]
* the original monument ""was not maintained"" [interesting way to say *torn down*]

The Mountain Meadows Massacre is not a feel-good story on anyone's part. The emigrants--who are undeniably teh victims here!--have been built up in collective memory to look not so good (victim blaming is always the easy way out), the Mormons don't look good, the U.S. government doesn't even look all that good for giving the impression of invading a territory (bad PR, overwrought officials fleeing and stoking rumours/hatred in Washington, giving up after one blizzard). The massacre didn't fit pre-Unruh theories about horrible violent Indians; but the real story of Indian participation in the beginning plus being blamed for the later events doesn't particularly suit *any* political agendas in more recent decades. The Utah Expedition roots that helped spark the slaughter are a diversion from the ""popular sovereignty is about slavery"" narrative that drives what you might call the major plot line of U.S. political history leading up to the Civil War.

Historical memory is not inevitable: people control what does and doesn't get told, as well as how it gets told. With so much history out there, far more than anyone could ever hope to know--yes, agendas are going to drive what does and does get ""told"" and ""remembered"". And as the history of the Mountain Meadows Massacre's commemoration shows, in this case people on all sides had a much more vested interest in forgetting than remembering."
547,AskHistorians,"In Philip K. Dick's alternate history novel ""The Man in the High Castle"", the victorious Nazis are depicted as having completely wiped out the native population of Africa. Was a genocide like the Generalplan Ost in the Nazis' longterm plans for Africa?","In short, no. And even things like the Generalplan Ost are less clear in what they were intended to be than people often assume but more on that below.

The thing about post-war plans is that they tend to be extremely tentative and uncertain until the point the war is actually over and even then they can change in some rather crucial details. Just as a quick look at the Allies: The first sketching of plans began in earnest in 1943 after first territories in North Africa had been liberated and many things weren't actively settled until Yalta and Potsdam in 1945 and even then substantive changes remained, f.ex. Yugoslavia becoming a socialist country. Plans for how the occupation of Germany would be handled concretely weren't finalized by the time the first German city, Aachen, was liberated by the Western Allies. So, post-war plans by the Nazis at any point in time are to be taken with a huge grain of salt and were subject to constant change.

Generalplan Ost is actually the best example of this. I've written about it before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6eqm99/why_is_the_generalplan_ost_considered_different/) and the crucial point is that the GPO was never fully implemented, only in very small parts. Because of rising, cost, effort, and the course of the war, planning for the GPO stopped and all started projects in connection to the GPO came to a halt after 1942, when the Nazis decided instead to use their available resources and manpower for the war and the Holocaust (which had been a crucial part of the GPO). What was implemented was very piecemeal and compared to the grand vision of the plans, comparatively small scale.

The same holds true for other plans, some of which never really made it out of the planning phase. Here the example of the Madagascar Plan is very fitting. I've written some more about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5hkvcr/what_were_the_nazis_planning_to_do_with_the/) and with this example, the gist once again is that the so-called DIII proposal is genocidal in its intentions but only every existed in a very, very rough outline that never made it past a draft phase due to the fact that it wasn't feasible under existing conditions – Allied control of the seas – and that it was never fully endorsed by the entire political establishment of the Third Reich, which due to the political structure of Hitler's Germany had a tendency to be at each other's throat the entire time of its existence.

This last point is important because there only existed one agency charged with developing policy towards Africa: The NSDAP Office of Colonial Policy (Koloniapolitisches Amt der NSDAP – KPA). The KPA had been founded in 1934 and drawn together Nazis who had been involved in colonial policy during the period of Imperial Germany prior to WWI and charged with the mission of developing plans on how to bring former German colonies back under German control. It's head was Franz Ritter von Epp, an old Freikorps member and early Nationalsocialist.

Epp was rewarded this way for his continuing loyalty to the Nazi movement. A former soldier and successful Freikorps leader he might have been but a shrewd political operator he was not. Within the power structure of the Third Reich all his attempts to re-make the KPA as an official state agency rather than a mere party office failed and in 1938 the German Foreign Office won a significant political victory over Epp by taking charge of all efforts to win back the German colonies. Henceforth Epp and the KPA were charged with developing plans for Africa in general.

For the next two years, Epp and his fellow Nazi colonial administrators without a colonial empire sat around and dreamed up megalomaniac plans for how a new German colonial Empire in Africa would look like. Most of these plans however were either so bad or so unfeasible that they apparently never made it to the phase of being written down coherently and therefore there is little record of them whatsoever.

Only in 1940 with Axis success in North Africa did the KPA have its fifteen minutes of fame. What they essentially did was dig up old drafts from WWI Germany for what would happen after a German victory in Africa and slightly re-tooled them. Effectively, they planned for a large central African German colony encompassing the majority of British colonies in the area and containing Tanganjika, half of Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, Nordrhodesia and the Kongo with South Africa as a German puppet state. attached to it. They drew up racial laws more modeled along Nazi lines for these territories that were closely oriented also on those in South Africa and Rhodesia. Their plan also included some presence by the SS.

However, this plan – and this must be emphasized – was really, really rudimentary and while the KPA did already start preparing future colonial administrators for their role, it lacks the detail that – say – even the GPO had. This is all laid down in a document that doesn't encompass more than a good 30 pages of typewriter script, which isn't all that much.

And Epp's fifteen minutes would be over soon anyways. Going on into 1941 and 1942 losses in North Africa squashed dreams of a Nazi colonial empire and in 1943 the KPA and all Nazi planning for Africa was officially ended by Hitler and Bormann with all resources going into planning for the East.

Epp's plan did include very harsh racial laws that certainly could be seen as a preparatory stage to genocide or in as much as South African and Rhodesian policy edge on forms of cultural and other genocide but it did not include such concrete measures like the GPO, the Hungerplan or the Holocaust. Like so many other things it was a Nazi fever dream fantasized up by people who saw themselves as the future white supremacist overlords over the world and who thought that they could colonize Africa on a 30 page memo.

Edit: There still is an interesting history to write about Nazi war criminals fleeing to Africa though as just a few crumbs of information I dug up for [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9b0q48/why_would_nazi_doctor_horst_schumann_receive/) reveal though.

549,AskHistorians,"How did ""white people"" become one race in the United States when there used to be so many nationality distinctions?","This question is an excellent one, but it veers into notions of sociology a bit, so I apologize in advance if this answer is a bit narrow. I'll chip in with a brief summary of an outstanding historical investigation called 'The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction' by historian Linda Gordon. 

In sum, Gordon makes a very good argument for this sort of watering down of racial ideals into simply ""white"" and ""other"" as a product of American western expansion in the Reconstruction period (late-19th century and very early 20th). Her book tells the story of a group of orphans who were sent west from New York City to Arizona in 1904. These orphans were taken in by a Catholic organization that housed, schooled, and fed what were classically thought of as street urchins that spanned any number of nationalities. These kids represented a mixed bag of Italian, Irish, Dutch, German, Russian, etc. heritages, and were the product of broken, disintegrated, or lost families in many cases. 

This is where it gets interesting, though. In New York City, these kids were viewed as undesirable for any number of reasons, not the least of which because of their respective ""races."" In short, the Catholic charity that looked after these kids couldn't give them away (literally...nobody would take them). An idea was hatched to clean these kids up and send them west, where good, Catholic families that applied and were properly screened could adopt them. Out west, these kids could be a boon to families who had lost their kids in the journey west, or just due to the sometimes harsh conditions out there. 

Gordon's book details a 1904 expedition of children sent to an Arizona mining town called Clifton/Morenci (the towns were combined) where a number of generous, charitable Mexican families went through the proper channels to apply for and adopt these kids for a number of entirely respectable reasons (because these families had lost kids of their own, because they saw it as their Christian duty, etc.). It is important to note that these kids weren't just given away willy-nilly: the families that adopted them went through the proper channels, as did the organization that saw to their relocation. 

None of the white families in Clifton/Morenci had shown any interest in adopting these kids before the children arrived in town, but a very interesting thing happened once they did. When the white residents of the mining community saw these white kids get off the train and go to live with the Mexican families, they LOST. THEIR. MINDS. Something akin to a lynch mob formed that evening, and the white residents went house to house, armed, and took the white children out of the Mexican homes. At one point, this white mob held the priests and nuns responsible for the adoption placements at gunpoint, and demanded the names of all the families that had taken custody of these ""white"" children. 

Sadly, the courts upheld this action as entirely legal and justifiable, since (according to the courts) these white adults were acting in the best interests of the children. Yep, the courts sided with an armed mob of kidnappers because it thought that Mexicans getting custody of white children was so offensive and dangerous an act, that armed abduction was necessary to rectify the situation. 

Gordon uses this incident to illustrate just how flexible and malleable notions of race truly are, and to illustrate how these notions were bent and reformed in the United States at the turn of the 19th/20th century. In New York, these children had been Irish, German, Italian, etc. Once out west, where whiteness was threatened by Mexicans, Native Americans, or Chinese, these kids simply became ""white."" So one could, by extension, argue that in the United States, the default ""white"" category developed as a defense mechanism for European transplants who saw an opportunity to reframe the debate on race once they were out west, where one's country of origin mattered less than if one was not Mexican, Native, or Chinese. This is a simplification of both Gordon's work, and the discussion on ethnicity studies in American history, but beginning with 'The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction' and digging into Gordon's sources might be a good place to start if one is looking to do a deep-dive on this subject.  

**EDIT** - I really appreciate the gold! There's been a lot of great follow-up answers here that more comprehensively outline the broader history of ethnicity studies in not just the U.S., but in Europe as well. For the people asking for more information about orphan trains, the legal ramifications of the 1904 incident, or ""whiteness"" in European culture, I'd recommend digging into Gordon's sources, or even just having a look at what u/FoucaultMeMichel wrote below.

551,AskHistorians,"In a recent interview with Joe Rogan, Jordan Peterson claimed: ""Now, in many ways, the first book was the Bible. I mean, literally."" To what extent (if at all) is this true?","It'd be really hard to be more wrong. Every statement here but one ('It's a collection of books') is outright false.

> Now, in many ways, the first book was the Bible.

The speaker seems very unclear about what they think 'book' means, but no definition could justify this. 'Books' in the sense of a single coherent and substantial piece of writing go back at least to the early 2nd millennium BCE. By contrast, the earliest parts of the Hebrew Bible date to around the 7th century BCE (somewhat earlier for isolated passages), and parts are as late as the 100s BCE; the Christian New Testament is 1st-2nd century CE.

> I mean, literally. Because, at one point, there was only one book.

It's hard to imagine what scenario the speaker could be thinking of here. There are thousands of older books.

> Like, as far as our Western culture is concerned, there was one book.

This has never been remotely true. The individual texts in the Hebrew Bible were composed over a period of, let's say, around 750 to 150 BCE (and the canon of which books to include wasn't decided until some centuries later). We have lots of books written before that period.

Even if we grant that many older books were forgotten for much of history -- the hundreds of ancient Mesopotamian, Levantine, and Egyptian ancient texts that we have today -- even so, from the same period we have hundreds of books written by Greek authors. Nearly all of *Genesis* is younger than Hesiod and Homer. In the case of *Daniel*, we even have some books by Roman (Plautus) and Berber-Roman (Terence) authors that are older. Some New Testament texts contain quotations from pagan Greek books. Proto-*Isaiah* (*Isaiah* 1-39) is older than any Greek books -- but it isn't older than, say, *Gilgamesh*, which was still circulating in the 1st century BCE.

> And, for a while, literally, there was only one book, and that book was the Bible, and then, before it was the Bible, it was scrolls and writings on papyrus, but we were starting to aggregate written text together. And it went through all sorts of technological transformations, and then it became books that everybody could buy -- the book everybody could buy -- and the first one of those was the Bible. And then became all sorts of books that everybody could buy, but all those books, in some sense, emerged out of that underlying book, and that book itself -- 

It's hard to extract any concrete claims from this rambling. 'Scrolls and writings on papyrus' was the normal medium for publishing books in antiquity. 'Books that everybody could buy' were on sale in 5th century BCE Athens, nearly a millennium before the Bible was compiled. It's insane to claim that the *Book of the Dead* and the *Odyssey* and the *Aeneid* 'emerged out of' the Bible.

There have indeed been technological transformations over the millennia, but they have nothing to do with the Bible, except in that the Bible benefited from them. The use of alphabets (in western languages) rather than abjads, the use of parchment rather than papyrus, the use of the codex rather than the scroll, the use of minuscule writing rather than uncial: the Bible didn't drive any of these. It just benefited from them, in exactly the same way that every other book did. The first book we know of to be published in codex format (pages bound at the spine, as opposed to a scroll) and put on sale in a public bookshop wasn't the Bible, it was Ovid's *Metamorphoses* (reported in Martial [14.192](https://archive.org/details/martialepigrams02martiala/page/506/mode/2up?view=theater)) --

> Look at this bulk! It's built out of many-layered leaves!  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It holds fifteen books of Naso's poem.

The speaker finishes with the only true claim in their statement:

> the Bible isn't a book; it's a library. It's a collection of books.

The individual texts in the Bible were written by various different authors at various different times over a period of many centuries: roughly 750-150 BCE in the case of the Hebrew Bible, roughly 40s-110s in the case of the Christian New Testament. For each corpus, the idea of compiling them together into a single canon is considerably later. The Torah (*Genesis-...-Deuteronomy*) was probably assembled not too long after the Exile, so roughly 5th-4th centuries BCE; *Joshua-Judges-Samuel-Kings* may have been assembled as a unit around the same time. The full Hebrew canon was decided centuries later, reaching its final form sometime not too long before 200 CE. A Christian canon was in the process of being formed in the late 100s (a fragment of a canonical list of texts survives from that time, the Muratorian Canon) but the full western Christian canon wasn't finalised until the Council of Rome in 382 CE. The deuterocanonical books weren't excised from Protestant Bibles until the 1500s. Based how the speaker refers to this history, though, it isn't clear how much of this they've grasped. Given how they understand the word 'book', my guess is: not much.

*Edit:* corrected a formatting error in the Martial quotation, and an infelicity of wording in the following sentence."
552,AskHistorians,"Why does Turkey deny the Armenian genocide so vehemently when the genocide was done by the Ottomans, not the current Turkish state?","As outlined in Geoffrey Robertson's book *An Inconvenient Genocide*, the core belief behind the Turkish denial of the Armenian Genocide lies in the *motives* for the killings. Turkish Officials don't deny that Ottoman military personnel killed Armenians; they dispute the amount (they claim 300 000, while the most commonly referred to number is 1.5 million) and the reasoning behind it.

Robertson cites the Turkish ""official"" numbers of Armenians living in Turkey at the time as a reason that 1.5 million Armenians couldn't have been killed: ""[Turkish] demographic studies prove that prior to World War I, fewer than 1.5 million Armenians lived in the entire Ottoman Empire. Thus, allegations that more than 1.5 million Armenians from eastern Anatolia died must be false.""

(It's noteworthy that Robertson counters this with evidence from the Armenian Church, who claim that 2.1 million Armenians were living in Anatolia at that time.)

On the intention, Article II of the United Nations *Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Genocide* outlines that, in order for a sanctioned killing to be classified as a genocide, there must be ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group..."". Turkish officials today claim that the killings were performed because Armenians ""rose up"" against the Ottoman government in support of Russia, hoping that in victory they would claim their independence. To support this, in 2007 Turkish counsellor Orhan Tung wrote in the New Statesman (an opinion that the government mirrors to this day) that ""credible evidence"" for the intention to commit genocide has never been concretely found. This is obviously disputed, because as opposed to the Holocaust or the Bosnian War, there are no reported documents that are widely internationally recognized as showing intent for genocide.

(Again, its worth noting that Armenian historian Ara Sarafian reported to Mediamax that *Talaat Pasha's Report on the Armenian Genocide*, which was published by the Gomidas Institute in April 2011, as a proper Ottoman government document showcasing this exact intent.)

tl;dr: The Turkish government doesn't belief that an Armenian *genocide* happened, but refer to it as politically motivated killings, because of the definition of ""genocide"" by the United Nations.

553,AskHistorians,"J.R.R. Tolkein single-handedly created our modern conception of staple fantasy races such as Elves, Dwarves, and Orcs. Are his versions based on earlier legends, or did he invent them wholesale?","Tolkien was a medievalist, so not surprisingly, he drew heavily from period primary sources. These, in turn, drew on actual folk traditions, although one must use a great deal of caution to see them as accurately capturing contemporary folklore. 

One of the more important deviations that Tolkien imposed on the world of his creation was the idea of good and evil, which was largely absent from Northern European folk tradition. The dichotomy was a Church-based importation, and the folk were not quick to embrace it. Tolkien, perhaps because he was a committed Catholic but perhaps also for the facility of his concept of plot and literature, embraced the good-versus-evil approach to his world, and this required some ""tweaking"" of the legendary traditions that served as his inspiration.

Although Icelandic sources include an odd reference to light and dark elves, there is no clear manifestation of such a concept in pre-modern Scandinavian, Icelandic, or British and Irish tradition. Nevertheless, Tolkien - drawing on this or simply setting off on his own - created a dichotomy where his elves were good and their counterpart, the orcs, played the role that one might imagine could have been assumed by ""dark elves."" In reality, folk traditions regarded all supernatural beings a dangerous even though most were neither good nor evil. They were to be treated with caution and respect, and they were to be avoided if at all possible.

Tolkien's dwarves are more at home in medieval primary literature than they are in pre-modern folk tradition. There are entities that seem to fall into that line (living within mountains, focusing on smithing, and various other attributes), but with dwarves we see the clearest, exclusive use of medieval sources."
554,AskHistorians,"Joseph Kennedy Sr. forced a lobotomy on his eldest Daughter, Rosemary which resulted in Rosemary being incapacitated and in reclusefor the rest of her life. Did he ever express any public guilt or remorse for essentially ending his daughter's mental life at the age of 23?","Just so we're clear in advance: [this is Rosemary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary_Kennedy#/media/File:Rosemary_Kennedy_at_Court.jpg), making her debut at the English royal court.

In point of fact, none of the immediate Kennedy family expressed public remorse/criticism for inflicting the lobotomy on Rosemary--at least not directly. Now, whether they all believed it was the *right* thing to do, whether they believed it was the *utilitarian* thing to do, and whether they *indirectly* expressed a sense of failure or anger--that is, shall we say, a rather nebulous topic in biographies of the various Kennedys.

One camp, headlined subtly by Doris Kearns Goodwin and like a sledgehammer by Laurence Leamer at the two poles of the spectrum, sees in Joseph's actions after the 1941 ""surgery"" a man seeking solace (Goodwin) or who understood he had committed a major sin (Leamer). Joseph initially placed Rosemary at a rehab/care facility called Craig House that had an excellent reputation and charged the fees to back it up. Joseph's biographer (and actual professional historian) David Nasaw shows on the basis of letters sent to family members that Joseph most likely visited Rosemary several times over the course of the 1940s, although it became horribly clear she would regain any more of what had been wrenched away from her than some motor skills. Joseph's words to his family are noncomittal--""looks very well"" ""feeling quite well."" In 1949, probably owning up to the long-term prognosis, he arranged a special place for her at an institution/""school"" in Wisconsin run by Franciscan Colettine nuns. As in, he gave *buckets* of money to the place for special accommodations for her. 

Of course, while Joseph was doing all of this, he was keeping his family away from visiting Rosemary themselves, and misleading them about the shockingly awful lobotomy results. Whether he was trying to insulate himself from his wife Rose's wrath, or protect his family from seeing what he'd done, OR protect his family from seeing that what he perceived as a last-ditch attempt to help her had still failed, is left to question.

For his part, Nasaw, whose take is generally considered among the most equitable, refuses to make a judgment call on whether Joseph believed he had done the wrong thing. But although he won't go as far to paint Joseph as a father with at least *some* sorrowful feelings for his daughter as Goodwin, she is much more brutal about the effect this had on Rose. She tells the story of Rose asking her friends over and over, ""Why didn't you tell me?"" only for her friends to say, ""we didn't know either."" In her memoirs, she wrote:

> The operation eliminated the violence and the convulsive seizures, but it also had the effect of leaving Rosemary permanently incapacitated. She lost everything that had been gained during the years by her own gallant efforts and by our loving efforts for her. She had no possibility of ever being able to function in a viable way in the world at large.

I'm not sure how this is not generally accounted a direct attack on Joseph's decision, but it does not seem to be? But then, this may be a pattern. There is one letter where Joseph comments more extensively on Rosemary's existence in the world, rather than breezy mentions of doing well. In 1958, he wrote to the nuns of St. Coletta's expressing his deep gratitude for their ""persevering kindness"" towards Rosemary. And pretty much every writer quotes the same lines:

> I am still very grateful for your help. After all, the solution to Rosemary's problem has been a major factor in the ability of all the Kennedys to go about their life's work and to try to do it as well as they can.

Nasaw offers zero commentary; Goodwin suggests he is expressing sorrow for the outcome, and maybe or maybe not the decision. Disability rights advocates, on the other hand, have pointedly asked, ""Is Rosemary not 'all the Kennedys'?"" And in Joseph's words, they find him saying that isolating Rosemary in Wisconsin, away from the world's knowledge and from her own family, was the only way that the rest of them could be successful. That is to say: people with cognitive disabilities are a problem to be solved, and to be solved by exclusion.

Of course, the rest of the Kennedys went on to champion mental health services and services for people with cognitive disabilities on the national and even international scale. Rose Kennedy was orchestrating donations for child neurology research through the Kennedy Foundation into the 2000s--and, for whatever bitterness she held, ensuring that things with a name attached would memorialize Joseph as well as herself. Jack signed a series of mental health services bills into law; while they ultimately resulted in massively inadequate care for a lot of people when the requires facilities were never built (a failure of money and a crime of NIMBYism), Senator Daniel Moynihan suggested that Jack would have *flipped tables* in the White House if he thought people like his sister would not be taken care of. Eunice Kennedy Shriver's activism in creating an arena for social life and growth in the Special Olympics I've discussed elsewhere in the thread. Ted Kennedy was pushing for mental health insurance coverage parity until the end of his life. And people generally agree that the Kennedys did a lot to raise awareness of the actual, real existence of people with cognitive disabilities and mental health disorders--and more to the point, of starting to crack the stigma on talking about them in the first place.

They shouldn't get all the credit. The 1950s saw mothers (and some fathers, but mostly mothers) of children with Down's syndrome banding together in parents' groups--ARC is founded in 1951--and did a lot to cast off the idea that a diagnosis of developmental disability was *the absolute end* for the togetherness of the family. On the other hand, you can't argue with the impact of the visibility--and pocketbooks--of the Kennedys.

I'm not a cynic who sees the other Kennedys ""using"" Rosemary as a platform, or rather, of ""taking advantage"" of her. Nevertheless, I have to wonder why--in the face of all the crusading--Rosemary herself was never allowed a presence. The lobotomy destroyed the person she had been...but there are all kind of people at all levels of cognitive ability in America. So I think it's a real question that both historians assessing the situation and disability rights advocates have to ask: were they (and hence, people in a similar situation) keeping Rosemary out of sight because of guilt, shame, unwillingness to criticize the family patriarch? Or did they conclude based on what they knew of Rosemary's own thoughts and hopes, rather than their own, what *she* would have preferred...had she only been able to voice them herself?

555,AskHistorians,Why weren't the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki considered war crimes? The United States wiped out hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians. Was this seen as permissable at the time under the circumstances?,"In brief, one can approach this question down in a few ways:

**Were they likely to be considered literal war crimes and open to prosecution at the time?** No, because the Allies came up with the definitions and applications of the ideas of war crimes, and exempted themselves very deliberately from prosecution. Were they hypocritical? It was argued by some of those under prosecution for war crimes, and even by some who were more neutral, that there were obvious hypocrisies (aside from the US and UK participating in mass bombing of civilians, you also have things like the Soviet lootings and rapes, as well as mass executions at Katyn, and so on), and that this devalued the usefulness of ""war crimes"" as a category if it basically only applied to losers in war. 

**Were they radically morally different from other Allied activities?** It depends on how you want to parse out the morality, but they are alike in many ways (though not all) to the use of napalm (firebombing) against Japanese and, to a lesser but still significant extent, German cities. In these attacks, mass areas were targeted, with deliberate goals of destroying civilian housing and infrastructure, and with the knowledge that many civilians would die. This was especially true of the infamous raids against Tokyo and its environs in March 1945, which killed as many people as the atomic bombings did. One could argue, if one wanted, that the atomic bombs were slightly worse from this perspective: they were considerably more deadly for the area of target destroyed, especially compared to later firebombings, because of their surprise and speed of attack (with firebombings, there are ways to detect the attack ahead of time and flee, and also some measure of defense possible in terms of firefighting and fire breaks; these were not the case with the atomic bombings). The Allies also did warn, in way both vague and specific, about firebombing attacks; they did not warn (contrary to Internet myths) about the atomic bombing attacks. Is this splitting hairs? It doesn't really matter for this analysis: if you are saying that the atomic bombs were ""just as bad or maybe worse"" than the firebombings, you probably already are concluding that the indiscriminate targeting of civilians was some measure of ""business as usual,"" which does _not_ in any way get you off the hook for questions about ""war crimes"" (in fact, it is even worse — saying you _regularly_ committed similar offenses does not make them less heinous).

**Did people at the time worry about the morality of these kinds of attacks?** Yes, both inside and outside the US government. There were many people in and out of the US who condemned the attacks, or at least questioned the city-targeting aspects of them. Within the US, even those who plotted to use the atomic bombs saw them as being imbued with special moral hazards, and thought that indiscriminate targeting of cities was potentially not aligned with stated US values. Scientists on the project (at the University of Chicago) warned that targeting cities with the first bombs would lead the world down a very dark path, and could not be justified (see the Franck Report). At higher levels, even the US Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, warned Truman that indiscriminate firebombing might allow the US to exceed the reputation of the Nazis for atrocities, and worked (in a way that one might or might not judge meaningful) to keep the city of Kyoto off the target list partially as a means of mitigating the moral issues. In a forthcoming paper, I have argued that I think Truman himself saw the bomb in these terms, and that in agreeing with Stimson that Hiroshima, not Kyoto, should be the first target of the atomic bombings, he was (incorrectly) under the impression that the bomb would be first used on a ""purely military target"" (as he put it) and not a city. He did not, I argue, learn Hiroshima was in fact a city (and that 90% of the casualties were civilian) until August 8, 1945, as an aside. All of which is to say, if someone says to you, ""nobody had moral issues with this at the time,"" they are wrong. Plenty of people, _including the people who ordered the atomic bombs be dropped_, recognized that this kind of bombing _did_ present moral hazards, though of course they did not think they were considering them ""war crimes."" But it opens the door to us considering them as moral hazards without being accused of being ahistorical.

**Did the atomic bombings violate any treaties the US had signed _at the time_?** No. The US had not signed many treaties on the laws of war at the time, and the ones it did sign did not really come into play. One can make a very stretching argument that the atomic bombings might fall under the prohibition of the use of poisonous gases, but it is a stretch (they did not create significant contamination; the deaths were primarily from fire and blast effects). 

**Would the atomic bombings of Japan count as war crimes if they were done _today_?** The US has very lengthy guidelines for how it interprets the Geneva Conventions and the Law of War today, and how nuclear weapons play into that. In principle such an attack plan — target the center of a city for the purpose of destroying the city and terrorizing a country into surrender — would probably _not_ be considered a justifiable reason to use nuclear force, as it would violate the principles of discrimination (it would unduly target non-combatants) and likely proportionality (it is overkill for the goals it is trying to accomplish). This does not mean that you could not come up with a rationale for doing the same thing (e.g., you could re-frame the justification around military necessity, the limitation of conventional forces to do the same job, a focus on the military and industrial facilities in the target zone, etc.), but the rationale used _at the time_, which is to say, the destruction of a civilian population for the purpose of convincing Japan to surrender, would probably not pass the legal scrutiny of the JAGs. But these kinds of questions are notoriously difficult to parse in the abstract, so who really knows. Current US plans for the employment of nuclear weapons are structured around the ideas of discrimination, necessity, and proportionality, and so instead of saying, ""put a huge explosion in the city center"" they are about how you would destroy some specific military capability in the city. Is that a moral difference? This is a question for another day. But again, I suspect the US would _not_ find it easy to justify the attacks under the _present_ Geneva Convention it has signed to (some years after World War II) which is much more explicit about the illegality of targeting cities in this way. But we should also note, while we are on the subject, that the US has found the means to justify a lot of other kinds of city bombing after WWII, which makes me a wary about concluding that the lawyers could not find a way to justify it. They are clever, after all. 

In short: by modern standards they would probably not be permissible actions. By the standards of the time, they ride the line of what the Allies considered permissible _when they were doing them_, though this was seen by many as hypocritical. In any event, the fact that they were credited with ending the war (whether they did or not is a hot topic of scholarly debate), and the fact that the Allies created the war crimes tribunal, meant that not only were there no negative consequences for those who were involved in the bombings, but in fact almost all of those who were involved saw their careers flourish as a result of them.

557,AskHistorians,"I've heard that ""hunting accident"" is code for a monarch or noble having an undesirable son quietly disposed of (or more generally assassination). Is this true?","It's not ""code"", but such claims could be met with suspicion. Hunting accidents were both a natural and common occurrence, but also a good cover. 

Let's look at one of the more suspicious hunting accidents - the death of king William II of England in 1100. He was out hunting with two men - Walter Tirel and Henry (William's brother and heir to the throne) - when he was shot with an arrow after Walter mistook him for a deer. Obviously, one has to wonder how the hell someone mistakes their king for a deer. Other versions of the story have Walter know where the king is relative to the deer, and is simply unlucky with his shot. This is all difficult to believe because Walter Tirel was known for his skill with a bow and being a keen hunter - that's why the king had invited him to go hunting in the first place! Walter immediately fled to France and denied that he had ever gone hunting with William II. It was also recorded that William II had received a message that morning from a monk who had dreamt last night that the king would die if he took part in the hunting trip, which sounds a lot like a coded warning, but could also just have been a coincidence or an invention to help explain why God had chosen to kill such a sinful king, as in other versions of his death it was William himself who had the dream. It also just so happens that the only other person on the hunt, Henry, was then crowned as king of England and other members of the wider hunt benefited enormously from Henry's rule. If it was an accident, it was incredibly convenient for Henry. 

But the strange thing in this case is that people generally accepted it was an accident despite obvious problems with the story. Here's the most detailed account from William of Malmesbury: 

> “The sun was now declining, when the king, drawing his bow and letting fly an arrow, slightly wounded a stag which passed before him… The stag was still running… The king, followed it a long time with his eyes, holding up his hand to keep off the power of the sun’s rays. At this instant Walter decided to kill another stag. Alas, [Walter's arrow] pierced the king's breast. …Walter immediately ran up, but as he found him senseless, he leapt upon his horse, and escaped with the utmost speed. Indeed there were none to pursue him: some helped his flight…


Although there were rumours that it was an assassination rather than an accident, such voices were not the majority. The fact is, hunting accidents were normal. For prey like deer, a well placed arrow was usually sufficient for a kill, but sturdier animals like boar (a favourite of the aristocracy) had to be fought up close with spears and swords. Getting up close was the manly way to hunt, and that could be dangerous. Another of William II's brothers, Richard, had died in the same forest after being knocked down and trampled by a stag. The great Byzantine emperor Basil I died after his clothes were caught in the antlers of a deer and he was dragged by his belt for miles as it bolted. King Fulk of Jerusalem had the most brutal of accidents - his horse tripped at speed, leading Fulk to fall off and be followed by the tumbling horse. The saddle crushed his skull, but didn't kill him immediately. His injuries were so bad that William of Tyre records how his brains were partially forced out, and he died comatose three days later. Even accidental shootings could occur, such as with Valdemar of Denmark who, despite being very popular and having no enemies who would want him dead, was killed by a stray shot whilst hunting. 

So hunting was dangerous, and hunting accidents were a common cause of death that not even kings and emperors could escape. When we hear of some noble dying in a hunting accident, there's a good chance that it actually happened. This is especially true of accounts where it was an animal, not a person, that killed them. Where someone was killed by an arrow, that's when the suspicions start. Accidents could and did happen, but that's what made it a good cover story for a murder. At the very least, a hunting accident created plausible deniability - despite the clear problems with William II's death being an accident, it remains genuinely possible that it was so and the evidence of an assassination can all be dismissed as circumstantial. Given that William II was  unpopular, it may have been more convenient to go along with that story than to raise questions. We have no way of knowing whether William II's death really was an assassination. 

But generally speaking, 'hunting accident' was not code for 'quietly murdered', even when we have good reason to believe that someone was indeed assassinated."
558,AskHistorians,"In the painting 'February' from Très Riches Heures (1416, France), two people are explicitly depicted warming themselves in front of a fire with their genitals exposed. Why? Was this normal practice in the winter? Would people at the time have been surprised by the painting?","> What's with this? 

Class warfare.

The boorish, lowbrow peasants with their genitalia exposed are contrasted with (1) the woman 'closer' to the reader in the February miniature, whose clothes depict her as also a peasant but better off, and with (2) the [illumination for January](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Les_Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_Janvier.jpg), a parallel  scene depicting fully-clothed nobility.

Jonathan Alexander picks up on earlier identification of an Italian influence on several of the Months, including Jan-Feb. In that mode, you might see a peasant lifting her skirt slightly but modestly for warming. The Northern version's addition of the risque peasants, given the mostly-traditional miniature cycle, is thus A Statement.

To support the idea that it's not a depiction of different, er, *warming practices* between Italy and France, Alexander also identifies the phenomenon at work in the [September miniature](https://i2.wp.com/www.digitalmedievalist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/September_tres_riches_cluny_MS_65_F9_VMS_65_F9_V_det.jpg?w=714&ssl=1). Most of the peasants are stooped over, hard at manual labor. But of course the reader's attention is drawn to the center, where a peasant is bent over thus exposing his buttocks. He is grouped with two beasts of burden in the immediate viewing frame, not with other people. 

The *Tres Riches Heures* skates an interesting line between the standard ""virtuous peasant"" depictions, and the ""lazy peasant"" ones. These peasants aren't *lazy*, but they're...I think a good parallel would be, they're the medieval version of ""virtuous rednecks.""

And the [December illumination](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Tres_Riches_Heures_du_Duc_de_Berry_-_December.jpg/725px-Tres_Riches_Heures_du_Duc_de_Berry_-_December.jpg), based on the castle in the background, depicts the duke's servants and court hunting *in the royal forest*. The miniature cycle isn't just about demonstrating amused superiority over peasantry; it's a claim on the part of the nobility.

...Particularly, as Alexander points out, because any of the duke's contemporaries viewing the manuscript on display would have understood that the income from those peasants' backbreaking labor was what enabled the duke to afford such lovely decorations.

The *Tres Riches Heures* illuminations are an assertion of power."

560,AskHistorians,"Nearly everyone in the Western world knows the name ""Julius Caesar"" and recognizes his life as seminal to many modern civilizations. Has this been the case for 2,000 years, or is it the product of 18th/19th century neoclassical Roman weebs?","Summing up Caesar's position throughout the last 2,000 years is somewhat difficult to do in simple terms, because his significance to Western culture varies from era to era.

To begin with the more immediate reception of Caesar, that is in the immediate aftermath of his death, while his assassins would style themselves as liberators and freeing Rome from tyranny (Cicero goes so far as to call Caesar a tyrant and parricide of the fatherland, *De Officiis* 3.82f.), the people of Rome grieved and honoured Caesar as a god. This is reflected particularly in Octavian adopting the name Gaius Julius Caesar **Divi Filius** after Caesar's death and ""ascension"", and while he would go on to change his name again after assuming power, he kept the *Divi Filius* aspect of his name throughout.

The peoples' veneration of Caesar was exploited quite cleverly by the Triumvirs in the wake of their victory against Brutus et al. at the Battle of Philippi (though whether this was opportunistic reverence or genuine veneration of Caesar is perhaps up for debate); the fifth month of the year, Quintilis, was renamed Iulius (July), and Caesar was officially venerated as the Divine Julius, with Octavian even founding a Temple of Caesar.

Octavian continued to use his adoption by Caesar, and vengeance for Caesar's assassination, as justification for the moves he made in his career. His own legions were comprised of Caesar's veterans, and he continued to exploit Caesar's civic reputation to bolster his own. Even complaints about Octavian largely focussed on his reliance upon Caesar's memory.

It's worth noting, though, that once Octavian became Augustus, Caesar's significance dwindled somewhat under the cult of Augustus (though this is not to say that Caesar became objectively insignificant); Augustus came to rely on his own reputation rather than that of Caesar's before him. Augustan literature in particular came to downplay Caesar in favour of revering Augustus himself; Horace, for example, drew direct association between Caesar's triumvirate with Pompey and Crassus, and the origins of civil war (*Carmina*, 2.1.3f.), while Virgil's *Aeneid* drew attention to Caesar as a bellicose figure (see Anchises beseeching Caesar to lay down his arms, *Aeneid* 6.834f.) while depicting Caesar's bitter rival Cato as a lawgiver (*Aeneid* 8.670).

Caesar continued to be revered throughout Imperial history, albeit at varying degrees. The month of July continued to be held in his name, of course, and the title *Caesar* was held by Roman Emperors throughout the period. It's perhaps worth noting, though, the significance awarded to Augustus' position over Caesar's that after the Empire's split the title of *Caesar* was given to sub-emperors, while the emperors themselves held the title *Augustus*.

Imperial depictions of Caesar held him as the cure to the late Republic's numerous problems; he broke the cycle of aristocrats and do-nothings by installing a new sort of power. In short, he was seen as a turning point. Imperial historians, such as Velleius Paterculus and Appian, awarded Caesar perhaps disproportionate attention against later rulers; Cassius Dio devoted a tenth of his eighty books on Roman history to Caesar's career, despite this comprising only a short period of his work's 1,000-year coverage.

By the time of the later Roman empire, however, Caesar's centrality to Roman history had diminished, and his achievements were used largely as a comparison to the superiority of writers' contemporary rulers; Caesar was no longer the turning point of Roman history, as Christianisation had seen Rome's adoption of the faith as the seminal moment of history.

However, Caesar himself was not forgotten even after the fall of Rome; his name continued as a designation of the highest power, reflected in the Holy Roman Imperial title of ""Kaiser"" (and, later, in the Slavic title ""Czar/Tsar"").

Caesar, as founder of the fourth great empire of Daniel's Biblical prophecy (Daniel 2:40-43), became seen as an instrument in God's divine plan, and was thus depicted as a model of chivalric virtue and the ideal king, and was even held as a comparison for contemporary rulers to aspire to. Medieval English and French writers in particular praised Caesar for his chivalry, while German writers, who saw the Holy Roman Empire as the natural successor to Rome, held Caesar as the founder of their own empire, and depicted him as an ideal ruler from as early as the 11th century (see, for example, Archbishop Anno II of Cologne's *Annolied*). It's worth noting as well that Caesar continued to be held as a somewhat multifaceted hero, though; while the embodiment of chivalric virtue, he was also victim to his own hubris.

Perhaps the most notable depiction of Caesar aligning with medieval ideas of the man is Dante's *Inferno*; as an unbaptised soul (obviously), Caesar was condemned to Limbo but was held as the one of the virtuous there (*Inferno* 4.123), while his murderers Brutus and Cassius are condemned to Hell to suffer alongside even the likes of Judas (*Inferno* 34.61-67).

The Renaissance brought a rejuvenation in Caesarian reverence, particularly after the ""discovery"" that it was in fact Caesar himself who authored his *Commentarii*, which was held during the Renaissance as a key text in Latin education. The *Commentarii*, seen as a unique glimpse into pre-Roman Gaul, even developed into a key work in the study of Gallic history. It became a work transposed even into contemporary times; poet Giannantonio de Pandoni composed a prose piece that drew on Caesar's *Commentarii* as inspiration for depicting his own contemporary war between Venice and Milan (albeit without drawing direct comparison). Even Pope Pius II, who himself authored an autobiographical *Commentarii*, appropriated the Caesarian model by portraying himself rather explicitly in the cast of Caesar, associating his own struggles against the enemies of the Papal States with Caesar's struggles in his civil war. Writers like Petrarch and Machiavelli continued to draw on Caesar as a figure of contrasting reputation; an agent of hostility to the virtues of the Republican, but simultaneously a praiseworthy genius and chivalric ideal.

Of course, his significance is also represented in Shakespeare's own plays about Caesar and the aftermath of his death; Shakespeare's depiction of Caesar suggests that the people were familiar, or at least aware, of Caesar as a historical figure. At the very least, they will have been aware of him after the fact.

I will bring my answer to a close here by bringing us to Caesarian reception during the Enlightenment. In this period of philosophical advancement, Caesar was regarded as one of the emblems of absolute monarchy, representing the martial prowess and cultured education that was considered the ideal for an 18th-century ruler. He was seen, as well, as a somewhat benevolent despot; using his absolute authority to impose social reform on a nation very much in need of it. Voltaire in particularly, while acknowledging Caesar's failures, held Caesar as the ideal philosopher-king.

The Revolutions of the 18th century were themselves no stranger to drawing upon Caesar as a significant figure; albeit not in the positive light he'd been awarded during earlier periods. As a symbol of absolute power, he was course seen as contrary to the ideals of the French and American revolutionaries, particularly as a warning for the dangers of a demagogue rising to power in the face of populism. Alexander Hamilton's *Federalist Papers* in particular used Caesar as a shorthand for autocratic power, and Hamilton also called Thomas Jefferson ""Caesar"" in warning of his potential.

Is it true that women couldn't buy property in the US prior to 1974?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/536nnx/is_it_true_that_women_couldnt_buy_property_in_the/d7qlw68/)

Goodness gracious no. And the Equal Credit Opportunity Act referenced in that post, while it does indeed prevent discrimination on the basis of marital status, is about the extension of credit (loans), not possession of property.

That said, the inclusion of marital status in the act (Title VII of the Consumer Credit Protection Act) was part of the final death of *coverture* in the US.

America was a British colony and thus derives its law code in large part from English common law, including the doctrine of coverture. Under coverture, married women were not actually legal persons--they were essentially treated like legal minors under their husbands' authority. All property was joint property (including any wages earned) and husbands had final say; women could not sue in court, make contracts, or buy and hold their own property. 

Note that in America as in England, this applied to *married* women, or feme couvert (""covered"" women). Widows and single adult women were classified as feme sole, full legal persons who could independently buy, own, and sell property, make contracts, and represent themselves in court.

The practical realities, enforcement, and effects of coverture are a contentious question in scholarship whether you're talking about the fifteenth century or the nineteenth. However, from the mid-ish 19th century to the 1970s we see a gradual ebbing away at coverture on a *legislative* level--on a state by state basis. (You'll notice that these two periods correspond to periods of flourishing women's rights activity. Not a coincidence.)

In the 1970s, some degree of coverture laws continued to apply in U.S. states like Louisiana, although very few of them. A series of Supreme Court decisions extended equal protection laws to marital status, which feminist legal scholars have considered to mark the final death of coverture. (I think this is why the AskReddit user's source picked out the 1974 law as significant, although not the significance that the post claims). Louisiana's ""head and master"" law, which legally placed the husband in control of the marriage and marital assets, was finally abolished by the Supreme Court in 1981 in Kirchberg v. Feenstra."

563,AskHistorians,What caused Ronald Reagan to win by such a massive majority of electoral votes (525) in 1984?,"Mondale painted himself into a corner against Reagan and formulated bad campaign strategies that backfired upon himself.

Mondale believed that with the fiscal deficit that Reagan was running that taxes needed to be raised, and announced he'd be cutting the deficit through large scale tax increases and that admitting this made him honest because Reagan would have to do it in the future anyway. But polling showed that 80% of Americans believed the deficit should be reduced via budget cuts rather than tax increases and Reagan announced he had no plans to actually raise or lower taxes. Mondale's tax plan also showed it would raise taxes on middle-income earners. Whilst Democrats had traditionally advocated for higher taxes in return for greater prosperity Mondale seemed to be advocating for tax raises in return for nothing.

Voters, in general, were pleased with Reagan's economic performance whilst in office, with his approval on the economy consistently above 60%. Private-sector job creation was nearly the strongest on record, economic growth the fastest in 34 years, housing starts at their highest in 6, unemployment falling although still relatively high, interest and inflation low. For an America which had just gotten through a serious recession Mondale's beating of the drum for restraint, tax increases, and caution wasn't appealing.

Voters, in general, were far less positive with Reagan's foreign policy which was at 50% or less, with polling showing 40% of Americans believed they'd see a nuclear holocaust which would end humanity within their lifetimes. Voters were worried by Reagan's aggressive posturing and at his failure to negotiate with the Soviet Union after the Soviet Union walked out of the 1983 Geneva Convention. Mondale attacked Reagan on this by proposing a softer tone and an immediate push for arms reduction but somewhat bizarrely voters didn't like this either. Polling showed that while people were afraid of Reagan's foreign policy they did approve of the concept of ""peace through strength"" and they didn't actually want a more conciliatory president. Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko's visit to the White House and the ascension of Chernenko to leader of the Soviet Union seemed to alleviate fears of a full-blown war, and showed that Reagan was able to be both strong and guarantee peace.

Reagan also underwent a process criticized as ""blandification"" where he somewhat distanced himself from his party and presented himself as a national figure of peace and unity, who wanted every day to be the 4th of July and brought Morning Again to America. Notably whilst Reagan won a landslide the Republicans lost 2 seats in the Senate and an 18 seat gain in the house still meant there were 253 Democrats to 182 Republicans, leading to a lashing out of some Republican figures, unhappy that Reagan seemed to do little for his party, with Newt Gingrich declaring ""He should have been running against liberals"".

So Reagan was well received on economic issues whilst Mondale painted himself in a corner nobody seemed to support. Mondale advocated for an unpopular foreign policy whilst Reagan seemed to solve one of the key problems of his Presidency and alleviate concerns about nuclear war, moreover, Reagan was able to project a very positive feel-good tone of the campaign which attempted to reach out to all Americans.

What happened to cause such widespread societal collapse over such a large area?","In 166 CE, a group of men claiming to be an embassy from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius arrived in the Chinese court at Luoyang. They weren't really an embassy - more than likely, they were just some marooned merchants from Alexandria - but they had managed the impressive feat of traveling the length of Asia. If some masochistic impulse had impelled them to make the journey overland, they could have followed the lacing branches of the Silk Road the whole way from Rome's eastern frontiers to the western marches of Han China. And over the five thousand miles of that wholly unnecessary journey, they would have crossed only three borders: from the Roman Empire to the Parthian, from the Parthian to the Kushan, and from the Kushan to the Chinese.

By the beginning of the third century CE, the political structure of Eurasia had been more or less stable for a long time. The border between the Romans and Parthians had shifted little over the years, though the Romans had managed to claw away bits of Mesopotamia and Armenia. The Parthian realm had gone through a few cycles of fragmentation and consolidation; but it retained more or less the same borders it had defended since the great Roman campaigns of the Late Republic. The Kushans - as far as we can tell - controlled much the same parts of northern India and central Asia that they had for centuries. And the Han Dynasty, though riven by rebellion and gradually receding from its conquests in the Tarim Basin, still governed virtually all of its traditional domains.

A half-century later, the world had changed. The Roman Empire was still there, but torn by civil war and battered by invasions. The Parthians were gone, replaced by the Sassanid Dynasty. The Kushan Empire had withdrawn to India. And China was divided between three kingdoms.

It is tempting to connect these stories of decline, and there certainly were ties between them (as we'll see shortly). But it would be misleading to assume that they had the same root causes.

To begin with the Romans: the half-century between the assassination of Severus Alexander (235) and the accession of Diocletian (284) is sometimes called the military anarchy. Whatever you call it, it was an unpleasant time to be Roman. Domestically, the chief problem was a crisis of imperial legitimacy. Emperor after emperor was proclaimed by the legions, none lasting long enough to establish a dynasty, each compelled to placate the troops with currency-ruining raises and bonuses. The domestic crisis was worsened, and largely driven, by developments beyond the frontier. To the north, unprecedentedly large and well-organized tribal confederations swept over the northern frontiers. And to the east, the shambolic Parthians were replaced by the aggressive and expansionist Sassanid Dynasty, whose kings Ardashir and Shapur led massive raids into Roman Syria.

The Parthians had never had a strongly unified realm. Part of the problem was the decentralized nature of their imperial administration, which seems to have devolved a great deal of power to local dynasts. External pressures were another perennial weakness. From the reign of Augustus to their third-century demise, the Parthians were Rome's punching bag. Their capital was repeatedly occupied by Roman troops, and thier dynastic politics were chronically complicated by Roman interference. The nomads on their northeastern frontier were an additional long-term hemorrhage on the treasury. In the end, however, the Parthian Empire was brought down from within. Ardashir, the founder of the Sassanid Dynasty, raised his rebellion in the wake of a protracted war between the Parthian king and the Romans, and seems to have taken advantage of the ruling dynasty's exhaustion. A battle was fought, the Parthian king fell, and his dynasty died with him.

We know less about the Kushans than we do about their neighbors. Their decline in the mid-third century, however, can be blamed largely on the Sassanids, who conquered Kushan territories west of the Indus River. After these campaigns, the Kushans withdrew to the southeast, where their control would endure until the rise of the Gupta Dynasty.

The Han Dynasty, finally, declined and fell for reasons that had nothing to do with their western neighbors. The seeds of its collapse had been planted centuries before, when Emperor Guangwu, restoring dynastic control after the traumatic rebellion of Wang Mang, established a regime that encouraged local landlords to become increasingly powerful and allowed the imperial court to become progressively more remote. A series of disasters in the late second century (most famously, the Yellow Turban Rebellion), combined with a series of weak or underage emperors (often controlled by court factions) to create a power vacuum exploited by a generation of over-mighty generals.

There were interconnections between these four stories of decline, at least to the extent that the rise of the Sassanids destabilized both the Roman and Kushan regimes. And one could postulate meta-narratives of decline, based, for example, on the lingering effects of the Antonine Plague (which probably swept across Asia in the late second century), or on long-term climatic changes. But even if such a link could be proven, the declines of all four empires would have to be understood on their own terms.

Edit: Several insightful commentators have suggested that climatic changes may have played a substantial role in the general unrest of the early third century. This is certainly plausible, and some evidence exists for a period of cooler and wetter weather. I do not, however, believe that there is enough data to make any conclusion about the influence of climate, particularly since the decline of each empire can be adequately explained by social and political factors.

Finally, I have to say that I've been a bit overwhelmed by the response to this post; thank you all for your comments, for your awards, and for taking the time to read!"
565,AskHistorians,"Machu Picchu was never discovered by the Spanish invaders, or anybody else for that matter until 1911. Why did the Incas abandon such a good secluded and strategic location in such a desperate time?","I’ve done a lot of research on this (the Inca) but I’m unfortunately not at home so I can’t pull any of books out at the moment, but when I get home I may find them in a box and be better able to source these answers and double check my memory.

One reason is that the last (free) Incan emperor fled east into the Amazon jungle because of how effective Spanish cavalry was when augmented with infantry. The distinction of free Inca is important - for a considerable period, the Spanish tried to maintain the illusion of puppet/vassal emperors, the first of which was Tupac Huallpa. In fact, the point of the greatest resistance to the Spanish happened during the reign of the second such puppet emperor, Manco Inca, after his terrible mistreatment by the Spanish.

The advantage of metal weapons and armor in the Spanish cuirrasiers as well as firearms is often cited in the Spanish conquest of the Americas, but in Peru, where Pizzarro had an order of magnitude fewer conquistadors than Cortez - I think Cortez had \~2500 or 5000 and Pizzaro had around 500, of which almost 100 were cavalry? Again no primary sources to double check but I will edit when I return home if the numbers are wrong, but regardless there was a serious  disparity in the two Spaniard’s size and army composition. In Peru, cavalry rather than metal per se was the decisive factor. After a few engagements it seems the Inca realized that their overwhelming numbers would eventually win out against Spanish infantry *if they could piecemeal attack the very thinly spread Spaniards*, but not against cavalry in the plains, so they began ambushing small columns from cliffsides and across rivers. This did result in a handful of minor victories in which fewer than a dozen Spaniards were killed in total, which were immense morale victories, but more often than not Spaniards were able to withdraw in good order to eventually reform in terrain they knew they could win.

It also isn’t part of the general western imagining of the conquests, but it cannot be understated that both Pizarro and Cortez were very reliant on the thousands of native allies they had to supply them but also act as the anvil to their hammer, as native infantry secured their flanks from imperial Incan armies during their major engagements. The story of how these natives became allies is itself fascinating but outside the scope of this question. The siege of Cuzco, the major event of Manco’s resistance/rebellion, lasted as long as it did because even though there was a sizable Spanish infantry garrison, they had split and sent most of their force, including the ultra-important cavalry, elsewhere, and what cavalry remained didn’t have sufficient support from native infantry to protect itself and break the siege on their own for a great while.

The Inca tried several resolutions to Spanish technology, the aforementioned ambushes, but the only time there was a serious and significant challenge to Spanish authority after Atahualpa actually involved feats of engineering, which the Inca were masters of, from their [exceptional road system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_road_system) to [cyclopean, monolithic fortresses like Ollantaytambo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollantaytambo). During the last large scale battle (which I can recall without primary sources), Ollantaytambo, the Inca rerouted nearby irrigation canals to flood the battlefield, hoping to force the Spanish to dismount. The Spanish weren’t willing to assault without their cavalry advantage, but the Inca weren’t or couldn’t press the advantage either (I can’t recall why, again no sources in front of me), and shortly after the majority of the Spanish forces returned. With that, Manco knew the one ace he had the Spanish army didn't, Incan engineering, had been played, in likely the only place where he would have time, resources, and most importantly opportunity to attempt it, and was forced to flee.

His choice of retreat was excellent as the jungle and mountain highlands prevented Spanish cavalry from maneuver and the visibility greatly reduced the utility of Spanish guns, which did not completely but did go a great way toward leveling the field of combat, as the post-Cuzco empire, sometimes call the neo-Inca empire, held out for decades in the Amazonian jungle, aided by a combination of disease, secrecy, and the lack of cavalry. However, Manco was never able to command large infantry forces, most nobles having been swayed by Spanish victory after Ollantaytambo, and the Spanish were able to scout and pursue using primarily native forces with Spanish officers.

Let me take a moment and say that it is actually contentious whether or not the Inca royalty did or did not retreat to Machu Picchu at some point and whether or not the Spanish did or did not go to Machu Picchu independent of that during the manhunt for Manco post Ollantaytambo. There are some historians (a minority, but a legitimate and credible one, not some crazy ancient-aliens minority as seems to sometimes unfortunately gravitate to Incan history) who believe that there is evidence Manco Inca did briefly hide at Machu Picchu in the interim period between fleeing Ollantaytambo and the failed siege of Cuzco and arriving at Vilcabamba, the palace within the Amazon. The Spanish were hesitant to explore the mountains and jungles where they knew their cavalry were ineffective *and* the Inca could arrange ambushes, but Machu Picchu’s only real defense was its secrecy. It is too small to house a large garrison and even a small garrison would have been problematic - while the palace had gardens for supporting the servants, from what I recall the palace was primarily supported by nearby villages and could not have self-sustained, and that support would have ended during a siege, at which point the Spanish and their Incan allies would have vastly outnumbered the garrison. If he had retreated to Machu Picchu, and as I said there is contention whether he did or did not briefly, word of Spanish aligned scouts may have pushed him from Machu Picchu to Vilcabamba A. so as not to be trapped and B. for the aforementioned benefits of the jungle in countering one of the most important Spanish advantage, although by that point Spanish reinforcements from Mexico were arriving and different native noble groups had been granted elevated positions of power/bribed so as to supplant those who had held power in the Incan hierarchy, and by the time of Vilcabamba any hope of a serious resistance was functionally over.

566,AskHistorians,"If I were to eat 3 loaves of bread, one from Egypt in the year 2200BC, one from Rome in the year 45BC, and one from England in the year 1100AD, how much different would each one be to the modern day and/or to each other?","I can't speak to Roman or Egyptian bread, but a recent collaborative project has been studying early medieval English bread and [sharing their results on a fantastic blog](https://earlybread.wordpress.com/). The project is a collaboration between Debby Banham (University of Cambridge) and Martha Bayless (University of Oregon), and their research is still ongoing.

They argue that most bread would have been flat bread, and likely unleavened. Think dense, heavy biscuits. Poorer households would have used bean flours, while mixtures of rye and wheat would have been the choice of people who were better off. Sometimes, oats or barley might be available (though oats were probably cultivated more for horses, and barley for beer). All these flours are low in gluten (except for wheat), and would as a consequence have been pretty dense (gluten is the protein that allows bread to build a springy, airy structure when leavened with yeast). Refined, fluffy, yeast-raised wheat bread was rarer: you have to throw away a lot of the flour when you sift it to make white bread, and that's a luxury. You also have to cook it in an oven, which takes more fuel to fire than flat bread (which can be cooked on a rock in the hearth, or a frying pan). As a consequence, the kind of bread we enjoy today would have been something of a rarity, reserved for wealthy tables or special occasions. Ordinary people would have eaten something much more dense, tough, and filling."
567,AskHistorians,"I own a 5 floor apartment building in Berlin. Or better, what is left of it. It is June 1945. After the bomb raids the facade still stands, the rest is collapsed floors, burned debris and unexploded ammunition from the street fights. Who will help me rebuild and will I get compensated/subsidized?","The short answer is that no one would have helped you rebuild, and nobody would have subsidized the repairs. You would have been largely on your own.

The unexploded ammunition in your collapsed building might have attracted the interest and attention of the occupying militaries. Unfortunately, methods for disposing of unexploded ammunition in Berlin immediately after the war are not well-documented. (Anyone who finds further information on this topic, please weigh in!) Most probably, the local occupying military would have coordinated removing this. Unexploded bombs remain an issue across German cities to this day, however, so it is possible no one would have come to help you at all. But ammunition clearing is the most likely reason that authorities would have played a role in clearing out your ruined building.

Once it was clear that the building wasn’t going to explode, however, you were almost certainly on your own. One of the most famous images of postwar Berlin—and indeed, of many German cities in the postwar period—is that of the “Trümmerfrau” or Rubble Women. These were women who went around gathering up the crumbled remains of buildings destroyed by bombs and in street fighting, and carted them away to begin a city’s rebuilding process. Although a heroic image of women stepping up to help rebuild the country persists up to today in Germany, it is not the whole story. Women were only the primary source of rubble clearance in the Soviet zone of Berlin. There, they were not volunteers—instead, they were forced to clear rubble away by the Soviet occupiers, who considered the civilian German population responsible for the existence of the war, alongside the German military. (Some unemployed men were also pressed into rubble clearance in this zone, but more women than men were available, leading to a gender imbalance.)

In the other three Allied zones (the British, French, and American), penal labour was used for rubble clearance. German prisoners of war and former Nazi Party members—both male and female—were forced to clear the streets in these parts of Berlin. This was seen as an “atonement measure.” This was a direct reversal of Germany’s policy for clearing up bombing-related rubble created during the war, when foreign POWs and people held in concentration camps were used to clear up cities after Allied air attacks. The other source of rubble removal was professional – companies and individuals who had cleared rubble during the war were also contracted by Allied military administration governments after the war, sometimes using their own equipment that the Allies had confiscated and then were loaning back to them. This method was first and foremost used to clear public spaces, such as major roads and intersections.

So, in the east of Berlin, women might have helped to clear away some of the piles of rubble that spilled onto the streets and sidewalks from your building, while in the west, prisoners and former Nazi Party members would have done this work. However, any further repairs on the building would have been up to you, the owner. As Jeffrey Diefendorf (author of *In the Wake of War: The Reconstruction of German Cities after World War II*) explained: “Individuals borrowed money, often from relatives in the country, and that is where they also found building materials. It was never centrally managed.” Unlike other countries that needed to rebuild, such as Japan and the Soviet Union, there was less centralization and planning, in large part because there was not a single central government running Germany. This meant that the centre was not issuing clear and timely directives or plans, and so people were left much more on their own.

The above description is true for anyone who did not have any affiliation with the Nazi Party. If, however, you were a party member – and particularly if you were a Nazi and were active in public life (i.e. a member of the SS, the police, or a civil servant), you might not have retained ownership of your building. One of the first things the occupying Allied powers did in Germany after the war ended was start a process known as “denazification.”  This involved arrests for many (400,000 Germans were placed in internment camps and underwent case-by-case reviews between 1945 and 1950.) Others who had been lower down in the system had to fill out detailed forms explaining what they had done during the Nazi period. One of the penalties for people identified through the denazification process was being stripped of one’s property.

I say “might” not have retained ownership because denazification was unevenly and incompletely applied. Not anywhere near all Nazi Party members were caught, those who were did not usually go through rigorous investigations, and the entire denazification process ended relatively quickly. In West Germany, many former Nazis were able to reintegrate into public life within a few years. Others made surface-level changes to their identities and avoided the less-than-rigorous system of detection. And still others managed to get out of losing their property by transferring the rights to a non-Nazi Party member right before their denazification investigations/tribunals began. It was a deeply imperfect process.

As long as you had not been a Nazi Party member active in public life, then, you probably would have retained control of your building, and repairs would have been your own responsibility. On the other hand, within the Soviet zone of Berlin, in addition to former Nazi Party members, people considered political enemies were also sometimes arrested and interned. Therefore, if your building was located in this zone, it is possible you might have been targeted as a capitalist landlord. However, there were lots of people who opposed Communism in that zone, and the owner of a single apartment building may not have been rich or powerful enough to attract the attention of Soviet authorities. (Unless you treated your tenants poorly, and one or more of them reported you to the new Soviet military government to punish you. In that case, watch out! They might have investigated you.)

For anyone surprised to learn that rebuilding was this ad-hoc and individual in postwar Germany, it is worth noting two things. First, the famous Marshall Plan designed to “rebuild” Europe was primarily focused on rebuilding entire economies—not individual pieces of personal property. It operated at a government level, and individual residents of countries did not get cheques or funds from it directly. It also did not come into effect until late 1948 or 1949. As you can imagine, many people had already decided what they were going to do with their damaged buildings and homes years before that.

Second, for anyone surprised that this individualistic, deal-with-it-yourself attitude was also in place in the Soviet Zone (the eastern portions of the city that would become part of East Germany), it may be even more surprising to learn that ownership of real estate (“personal” property as the Communists preferred to call private property) remained legal throughout the entire duration of East Germany, explicitly protected in multiple constitutions written for the country. This was not in keeping with the spirit or the ideology of Communism, necessarily, but the Soviet Union had entrenched property ownership and struggled to move away from it, and as a result pushed all other Communist countries within the Warsaw Pact to follow their lead (both because they believed it was effective in keeping the population invested in the national project of Communism and to not make them, the Soviets, look bad.)

So, TL;DR – no one was swooping in to help repair war-damaged private property in postwar Berlin.

#**What would Muhammad likely have believed?**

While most of Arabia pre-Islam followed locally-based, polytheistic religions, there was a small movement of people called ḥanīfs. Being a ḥanīf essentially entailed in believing in Abrahamic monotheism (as opposed to the standard polytheism of the Arabian Peninsula at the time) but it wasn't a set religious creed. The Arabic root ḥ-n-f in ḥanīf means to incline, so ḥanīf was used in the Qurʾan to signal those who had returned to the monotheism of Abraham away from the idolatry of polytheism.

This sort of monotheism wasn't unknown. There were other figures around Muhammad's time who fell into such beliefs. One of them, the cousin of his first wife Khadija, Waraqah ibn Nawfal, was a hanīf with Christian leanings. Indeed, the fact that the Kaʿba (which became polytheistic pilgrimage center) was claimed to have been built by Abraham and his family meant that there would have been reasons for there to be ḥanīf around Mecca as a whole.

Wael Hallaq, one of the leading scholars on Islamic law, writes within his book The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law that

> Already in Mecca, Muḥammad conceived of himself as a ḥanīf, probably under the influence of a certain Zayd b. ʿAmr. Fundamentally monotheistic, ḥanīfiyya appears to have been a specifically Meccan religious development that was formed around the figure of Abraham and the Kaʿba, which he was believed to have constructed.

The ḥanīf definitely were partial to the other Abrahamic monotheistic faiths. Many of the ḥanīf ended up converting to Christianity (including Khadija's cousin Waraqah bin Nawfal) or, after the Revelation, to Islam. Zayd bin Amr was one of the few who remained fully ḥanīf, without converting to a more established religion.

Ḥanīfs as a whole were not a solifided movement, so they wouldn't have had a clergy. Certain men would preach in the countryside to those who would listen, as Muhammad would do later after the Revelation. Prior to this point, Muhammad would listen to Zayd bin Amr preach, which probably influenced the development of his own branch of monotheism.

Despite not being a solidified movement, the ḥanīfs tended to have some unifying characteristics. In an old paper, Charles Lyall wrote (by which I mean 1903, so methodology has definitely changed) about 3 of these characteristics. The Ḥanīf

> all belonged to the Ḥijāz and the West of the Arabian Peninsula; (2) ... their doctrine was distinct from Christianity, although several of those who professed the Ḥanīfite faith adopted that religion, and was also distinct from Islām; and (3) ... it had certain specific features - rejection of idolatry, abstention from certain kinds of food, and the worship of ""the God of Abraham""; ascetic practices, such as the wearing of sackcloth, are also ascribed to some of the Ḥanīfs (773 - 774).

The ḥanīf are not mentioned in any of the verses concerning the ʿaqd al-dhimma, or contract of protection, that was extended by Muhammad to the People of the Book. The traditional scope of the people of the book were the Jews and the Christians, the two other dominant monotheistic faiths who possessed certain customs, traditions, etc. (Although the definitions gradually expanded, with Zoroastrians, Mandeans, and controversially at times Hindus being included).

Part of this could very well be that there simply weren't many ḥanīfites, and that they were not organized enough to be considered a group worth mentioning. Charles Lyall writes that the word ḥanīf was only used by 2 poets in the time of Muhammad, and they attributed the adjective to only 10 men total (this is when ḥanīf is used to refer to a non-Islamic monotheist. The word can also be paired with the word Muslim to refer to a righteous Muslim). Of course, these are only the men important enough to be mentioned, but it holds that they were often individuals and not entire tribes who held ḥanīfite beliefs, so they wouldn't warrant the same official protections.

_____________
#**On to the second part of your question, how did Islam acquire its respect for the People of the Book?**

As you may known, Islam is an Abrahamic religion.  The Ka'ba in Mecca, the site of the ḥajj pilgrimage, is believed to have been built by Abraham himself as a shrine to Allah. In the Islamic perspective, it was only later that the Ka'ba got coopted by the Arabian polytheists and Muhammad's smashing of the idols was a restoration of its original intent.  Likewise, Judaism and Christianity are also Abrahamic religions.  However, Islam sees itself as being a return to the purity of religion that Judaism and Christianity lost.  This is why you will see many of the same prophets in the three religions - Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and even Jesus appear in the Islamic tradition.  If I recall correctly, Jesus is mentioned by name in the Qur'an more than Muhammad himself is.

Being part of this established tradition was important for Muhammad to develop in the early years of Islam, as links to it gave credence and legitimacy to his movement.  In fact, you'll see many more similarities between Islam and the other Abrahamic religions in the earlier stages of Islam than later.  I'm on the subway now and so don't have access to my books, but Wael Hallaq mentions how the tribes of Yathrib/Medina, where Muhammad was invited to in order to become an arbitrator between the various tribes (including many Jewish tribes), were considered something akin to the ""guardians of monotheism"".  Once Islam was more established and not dependent on the goodwill of these Medinan tribes to exist, Muhammad was able to make some changes that differentiated Islam from Judaism.  For example, the qibla, or direction faced during prayer, was originally Jerusalem instead of Mecca. 

In addition to theological links to the other Abrahamic religions, it is important to consider the simple reality of 7th century Arabia.  Although Islam was extremely successful and rapidly grew, incorporating numerous tribes wholesale, they could not fight everyone.  This especially became important with the expansion of Islam out of the Arabian Peninsula itself, when Christian client-states and Client-tribes of the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires joined forces with the nascent Muslim community.  

Under the Caliph 'Umar, it was envisioned that Islam would be for the Arabs, who would exist as a sort of military caste above the conquered people who would retain their original religions. For this reason, people were not forced to convert even when militarily conquered. This meant that the conquered populations were disturbed as little as possible, and conversions were only on a voluntary basis. This precedent was set with Muhammed allowing the Jews and Christians of Arabia to keep their religion if they paid the *Jizya* (poll tax). This payment would make a member of the religions of the book - Jews, Christians, and later Zoroastrians - members of the protected class, or *dhimmi*. These people would be reserved from having to pay the Zakat tax and from military service within the empire. This isn't to say that taxes wouldn't get absurdly high though, as Ira Lapidus notes that taxes on peasants could reach upwards of 50% of the value of the goods. It does, however, mean that the Muslim invaders were not hated. Like I said, some Christian tribes had allied themselves with the Muslims against the Sassanians or Byzantines.

This led to the fact that the Religions of the Book flourished in the early days of conquest with Islams coming. Many previously repressed sects were able to abound, and apocalyptic messages were numerous. This changed though as time went on. 'Umar II (r.717-720) forbade Christians to hold powerful government positions. Other successive rulers forbade minority religions to ride horses, bear weapons, or show outward religious symbols in public. Repression came in waves, as one Caliph would crack down (Such as Yazid II destroying churches and animal sculptures) and then others relent. Keep in mind through all of this that from the 7th to the 11th century, upwards of half the world's Christians lived under Islamic rule, yet they were not forced to exile or forced to convert by force (at least in large-scale).

So in summary, one could say that Islam feels a religious affinity for the People of the Book as well as it serving as a useful tool during the later Islamic expansions.

I've got to wrap this up quickly for work.  But I hope this helps and I'll try and answer follow-ups if you have any when I can!

569,AskHistorians,How did Sigmund Freud’s mother react to his theories?,"Some questions on /r/AskHistorians are difficult to answer, because the answer is probably 'we don't know'. And while reaction videos may be popular on YouTube, and people asking questions here very commonly want to know how people reacted to this or that...writers in the past just don't focus that much on what other people thought of things. So the chances of this having an answer is not high. Of course, maybe if I looked at some obscure journal article written in German in 1946, I'd discover what Freud's mum thought of his theories. Maybe I'm missing something embarrassingly obvious (I hope not!). But we don't know is *probably* the answer here.

Considering the centrality of the mother-child relationship to Freud's theorising, there's quite a lot of discussion of their relationship when Sigmund was a child. But there's really very little research into Freud's relationship with his mother (called 'Amalia' on her gravestone, but mostly called 'Amalie' in the family) when they were adults. There's even fewer that I can currently access; the book I'd want to have on me to answer this question (*Freud's Women* by Lisa Appignanesi and John Forrester) is in my office, and I've been working from home recently (but a look at the snippets that are available on Google Books suggests there is not that much about his mother as an adult in the book). The other book that I don't have access to that might be useful is *Freud And His Mother* by Deborah Margolis (published in 1977). Neither of the two letters in the 1960 *Letters of Sigmund Freud* addressed to his mother mention his theorising, instead being about life events. Certainly the big biographies of Freud (e.g., Peter Gay's *Freud: A Life For Our Time*) don't mention what his mother thought about his theories when they were both middle-aged or older - he was in his forties when he published his first big work, the *Interpretation Of Dreams*, and she was in her sixties. Such biographies are much more interested in Sigismund Freud's relationship with his mother when he was a child (perhaps for obvious reasons).

Freud himself seemed to both idolise and fear his mother, judging by his (really quite brief) discussions of his mother in his voluminous writings. He apparently felt a sense of freedom when she passed away. He doesn't seem to have discussed what she thought of his theories.

Another view of Amalie Freud - probably the most detailed - comes from Judith Bernays Heller (the daughter of Freud's sister), who discusses her remembrances of the family in [an article published in *Commentary* in 1956](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/judith-heller/freuds-mother-and-father-a-memoir/): 

> My grandmother...had a volatile temperament, would scold the maid as well as her daughters, and rush about the house.

> She was charming and smiling when strangers were about, but I, at least, always felt that with familiars she was a tyrant, and a selfish one. Quite definitely, she had a strong personality and knew what she wanted, and the best evidence of that is the way she held her two sons and five daughters together, in spite of all the divergences and differences in their interests and their temperaments. And she had a sense of humor, being able to laugh at, and at times even ridicule, herself. I remember her saying to me, when I was supposed to choose some present for myself from her cabinet, where she kept a few treasured antiques: “After all, the best antique in my house is myself, and me you cannot take.” 

Judith Bernays Heller doesn't, in her memoir of Freud's parents, mention what they thought of his theories. 

Freud was happy for his daughter Anna to become, basically, the most prominent keeper of his legacy after his death, so he wasn't opposed to women being practitioners of psychoanalysis, or having opinions about psychoanalysis. The impression you get from what is written of Freud's childhood is that his family largely kept to the tight traditional division of labour between the patriarch as the breadwinner (his father the successful wool merchant) and the matriarch as the head of the household within the household. Perhaps either she refrained from stating in public what she thought of the theory (if she thought about it at all - perhaps she had more important stuff to deal with, from her perspective), or nobody bothered to ask her (women's opinions were not always valued in the strongly patriarchal culture in that time and place - women did not get the vote in Austria until Amalie was eighty-four).

It's worth remembering, too, that Freud *didn't* think that male children wanted to sleep with their mothers, despite the pop culture impression of Freud. Instead, the Oedipal complex is much more metaphorical than literal - the child competes with the father for the mother's attention and love, and ultimately (given that Freud believed we are evolved beings whose behaviours ultimately derive from sex and survival, given the centrality of sex and survival to evolution) this competition is driven by biological drives which - later on, once puberty has occurred - also play a role in driving all that sexy sex stuff. So chances are that if he discussed his theories with her, he didn't present them in the salacious pop culture form of it, but rather as a relatively dry and technical theory of what causes mental illness.

...or maybe what she thought about her son's theorising *is* out there somewhere in one of the archives of Freud's papers and letters, and has simply never been translated into English (remembering that Freud grew up speaking German in Vienna)...or perhaps I'm missing something. It's hard to prove that negative - all I can say is that it does not appear to be widely known information available in every biography of Freud. In any case, Amalie Freud's opinion of stuff like the Oedipus Complex is, for better or worse, not seen as an important factor in Freud's biography."
570,AskHistorians,"In a game as ancient as chess, why is the queen the most powerful piece, considering the fact that women were not allowed to fight in any capacity?","This is primarily due to the Westernization of the older game of chaturanga/shatranj, which instead called the analogous piece _firz_ or _Firzan_, which translates to counselor, or wise man.  The pieces are essentially bound by the same rules as modern chess, the biggest difference being that the counselor could only move one square ~~in any direction~~ diagonally (as opposed to the modern queen which can move any number of squares in any direction).  There are other differences, such as pawns only being able to move one square, but a pawn reaching the end would also promote it to a counselor.

So at what point did the gender and title of this piece change to the queen?  H. J. R. Murray's massive 900+ page tome,  _A History of Chess_, which is still considered the seminal survey of chess history, discusses this (pp. 423-4):

> The name 'Queen' is a characteristically European innovation, suggested probably by the position of the piece upon the board and by the general symmetry of the arrangement of the pieces, which pointed to the pairing of the two central pieces. The name has reacted curiously upon the borrowed name _fers_, and has everywhere altered the gender. All the European names, and even the Spanish _alfferza_ in the Alfonso MS. of 1283, are feminine nouns. We have already seen that the same is true of the Russian word _fers_.

Originally, the Arabic name was adopted in Spain, France, and England, but was replaced by ""Queen"" in Italy, Germanic lands, and Scandinavia.  The adoption of the Arabic name, as opposed to a translation, suggested that the Europeans didn't quite understand the meaning of the word.  The same manuscript cited in the quote showed that the Spanish player associated _alfferza_ to _al faris_, which means horseman and comes from _faras_, meaning horse.

This deviation in adoption actually formed two divergent nomenclatures which resembled different philosophies about the game: King, Fers, Aufin, Knight, Rook, Pawn versus King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn.  The former was more characteristic of the Spanish adoption, which carried on the Muslim/Indian/Persian tradition that chess is a war game, while the latter was more characteristic of the German adoption, which viewed chess as a representation of the European state. As a result, the war aspect is deemphasized and the Queen's presence becomes more necessary.

What was perhaps the most amusing tidbit (although tangential to the original question) was how people would react to the promotion of a pawn to a queen once it reaches the 8th rank.  Murray describes it best (p. 426):

> In the Muslim game, the Pawn which reached the 8th line became at once a _Firzan_, whether the original _Firzan_ was still upon the board or not.  There was no incongruity in this, for there was no limit to the number of viziers that could exist at the same time under the 'Abbasid caliphate. The same promotion awaited the Pawn in European chess, but the new European game introduced unforeseen difficulties. Not only had the Pawn to change its sex, ... , but by its becoming a Queen when the original Queen was still upon the board the moral sense of some players was outraged. The boldest attempt was the prohibition of promotion so long as the original Queen was untaken.

So in summary, there wasn't a queen in the original versions of the game, which was played in the spirit of a fight or war.  The modern variant that has a queen stemmed from a particular European adoption which started using female names for the piece in Romanic languages as far back as the medieval period, even before its move was changed to be more powerful, and viewed the game as more a representation of the European state, which usually had a queen alongside the king."
571,AskHistorians,I've heard that it's a common issue in some parts of academia for PhD students to write their dissertations only to find out that someone in the USSR already wrote about this topic decades ago. What were the implications of this in the early 1990s when the Soviet archives were released to the west?,"Woo boy, there's a lot going on here.

&#x200B;

So let's start out simply. I don't think this is a particularly common issue. First off, someone having written about your topic decades ago does not necessarily disqualify it from being your dissertation topic, regardless of where it was written. A good dissertation proposal isn't just about identifying a topic, but also making a clear argument for why your theoretical framework and contribution to the overall scholarship is unique - and that can be true even if someone else has written about it. Still, I understand the spirit of the question - what if nobody knows about this other scholarship? I've never heard of that happening. I can't say it never happened, but I do know a number of senior historians of the Soviet Union and I've never heard them tell a story about this. I'd be interested to know who you heard this from that said this was a  ""common issue""

&#x200B;

Even as early as the 1970s, it was possible for a limited number of students to travel to the Soviet Union for research purposes (my own advisor was part of the first cohort of students to do just that, in fact). This put those students in direct contact with Soviet historians and Soviet students and gave them sense of what kind of research was being done. The foreign students in the Soviet Union often did not access to the material they wanted, but they weren't flying completely blind either. Scholars of the Soviet Union working in that time period had access to lots of published sources that gave them a reasonably, if incomplete, base.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, there were political implications of writing history in the Soviet Union that was also a constraint on Soviet historiography. I want to be clear, this doesn't mean that Soviet historians were necessarily outright fabricating information. It does mean that the kinds of topics that historians chose to write about and the methodologies they used were informed by political considerations. Without dwelling on this, that meant that western historians had more differences from Soviet historians than just access to information. They were also writing from somewhat different methodological frameworks. I want to stress, even when western historians were using Marxian frameworks and who were more let's say sympathetic to socialism than western scholars of the 1950s-60s (Conquet et. al), the \*kind\* of scholarship they were writing was somewhat different.

&#x200B;

If you look at the scholarship that came out of the 70s and 80s, a lot of the analysis of non-archival sources holds up. Rather than being entirely discarded, much of it has been built upon. Access to published sources was one thing western scholars really did have prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the opening of the archives and, just like today, those scholars/doctoral students of that era were expected to have an understanding of the published sources available to them. 

&#x200B;

Opening the archives did make a big difference for scholars of the Soviet Union. Scholars like Stephen Kotkin (who people might know for writing a three-volume saga on Stalin) got into the archives very early. The work that came out of the early archival research in his case was Magnetic Mountain, a book about the creation of Magnitogorsk, is illustrative of the impact of the archives (full disclosure, I'm also choosing to write about it here because it's one of my very favorite works on the Soviet Union). Of course, it was not news that Magintogosk existed, or even that it was an important site but the level of detail was unprecedented and allowed scholars to rethink how they understood broader concepts like the relationship between the state and the Soviet working class and how the state tried to physically build socialism.

I just pulled my copy of Magnetic Mountain off the shelf to illustrate the point. The two broad sections of the book are ""Building Socialism: The Grand Strategies of the State"" and ""Living Socialism: The Little Tactics of the Habitat."" Kotkin's chapter in the second part 'Speaking Bolshevik' was a real breakthrough and a concept that historians of the Soviet Union still do. Perusing the end notes from that chapter, it's apparent that access to new archival information was critical to the development of that concept, but he also frequently cites published sources that were available prior to the opening of the archives that Kotkin was able to recontextualize and interpret in light of the archival information now available to him as well as being directly and explicitly in dialog with western scholars who had written before him.

&#x200B;

So, that's a bunch of words that amount to something like ""I don't think this was necessarily the case."" Western scholars were not entirely ignorant of the historical work being done by their Soviet counterparts. The opening of the archives allowed for a new and more sophisticated understanding of topics new and old, but did not necessarily invalidate all that came before either, Soviet or Western.

572,AskHistorians,"Why didn't ancient Egyptian wall paintings depict them wearing winter clothing, although modern day Egypt can get pretty cold in the winters?","Great question! Ancient Egyptians did wear more than loincloths in the winter and during the cold nights. Some paintings and decorative art on ancient artifacts does in fact show Egyptians wearing long dresses, long pants similar to leggings, and many variations of cloaks and wraps.

Linen and wool were the primary fabrics before cotton cloth was invented. The key to understanding how they kept warm during the cold nights and were able to deal with such extremes of temperature is the concept of layering. Layers of linen covered with a top layer of wool is much warmer than it may sound. Silk was also used in the Ptolemaic period but I don't know much about this and perhaps others can shed light on how early this material was used and what kinds of garments?

One interesting factor not always obvious from the more famous pieces of artwork the general public may be more familiar with, is the possibility that a thin pant similar to modern-day leggings were frequently worn during cold weather, and especially by soldiers in ancient times. We only have physical evidence of this sort of garment as early as the 7th century but there are hints of these garments in ancient artwork.

There is no evidence that (very real) climate change or longterm cyclical weather changes has had such a dramatic effect that would indicate Ancient Egypt was much hotter than current day. If anything, data seems to support the opposite given rising temperatures in the desert.

Another consideration is that the artwork (like today's artwork especially commercial types like photographs in advertisements or dress worn by characters in television and film) often showed an idealized or more fashionable version of dress. Women were shown wearing tight and more sexually appealing clothes while in reality the average commoner was wearing a long loose-fitting gown, perhaps similar to modern day traditional jalabiya (جلابيات).

Capes and shawls were also very important to Egyptian culture and fashion and indeed many examples can be found in artwork.

Here are a few sources on all of this to use as starting points:

573,AskHistorians,Is removing pubic hair a modern fad or did any historical cultures engage in the practice?,"Good question! [I answered this a few years back,](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/35h1f0/did_ancient_roman_women_shave_their_legs_armpits/) but it was a fun topic so I'll pull that answer back in to play and polish it up to my current standards. 

Luckily for us, there are a few sources that discuss this, my favourite one being the famed poems of Ovid - which we know today as the *Art of Love*. Also luckily, I happen to have a [solid translation of books 2 and 3 handy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lb_67ONjRyGtoN9FpUjsiL4jQ_IgI4wF_aicjTEZvQw/edit?usp=sharing). We'll be looking specifically at book 3, section 4: ""Make-up, but in private,"" which begins with the lovely lines:

> How near I was to warning you, no rankness of the wild goat
under your armpits, no legs bristling with harsh hair!

Considering that *The Art of Love* is essentially a mock guide for teaching men and women how to get laid (emphasis here: it's satirical), it's got some hilarious stuff in there, if you want to give it a read :) However, this small section already does note that Roman women did distinguish themselves with depilation, and the most common ways they would accomplish this was with either plucking (generally with tweezers, eyebrows were also plucked), razors (not always the most desirable option, because the razors of the time had the unlucky tendency of leaving lots of nicks), and, the biggest one, rubbing your skin with pumice to remove unwanted hair, which honestly also sounds incredibly uncomfortable. Being absolutely fair, I've never done it.

Their artwork just confirms this - ~~some~~ **ALL** of the following being a bit NSFW (Quite a few of them are of people having sex in different positions). 

[Here's a cowgirl scene](https://i.imgur.com/nb2OYdM.jpg). [And another](https://i.imgur.com/UMM9eb7.jpg). [And another](https://i.imgur.com/704Zxyp.jpg).

If you click through those, there's a pattern that does make itself clear - there's no body hair on any of the women in question, which does lend itself to the idea of depilation. 

So how about men? Well, we *also* have attestation for that, from multiple sources. The more entertaining one is gonna be Martial *Epigrammata* IX, 27: (quick translation): 

> You have epilated testicles, Chrestus, and a cock that's like a vulture's neck, and a head smoother than a prostitute's ass, and there is not a single hair on your thighs, and merciless tweezers groom your bloodless lips. And you only talk about Curius, Camillus, Quintius, Numa, Ancus, and every sort of hairy thing that we might read about, and you are loud and threatening with grand words, and you argue with the theatres and with the present time. If some other butt-boy (sodomite) should come along, now that he's free from his teacher, and whose throbbing cock has been unleashed by the artisan, you, calling him with a nod, lead him off; and Chrestus, it shames me to say what you do with your Catonian tongue.^1

...*ahem*. Filthy Latin poetry aside, you get the idea. In slightly...tamer Latin, Suetonius gives lascivious accounts of Julius Caesar (of stabbity fame), giving a very specific nod to his....wanton ways:

> He was somewhat overnice in the care of his person, being not only carefully trimmed and shaved, but even having superfluous hair plucked out, as some have charged; while his baldness was a disfigurement which troubled him greatly, since he found that it was often the subject of the gibes of his detractors. Because of it he used to comb forward his scanty locks from the crown of his head, and of all the honours voted him by the senate and people there was none which he received or made use of more gladly than the privilege of wearing a laurel wreath at all times. They say, too, that he was remarkable in his dress; that he wore a senator's tunic with fringed sleeves reaching to the wrist, and always had a girdle over it, though rather a loose one; and this, they say, was the occasion of Sulla's mot, when he often warned the nobles to keep an eye on the ill-girt boy.

Finally, the job of ""hair plucker"" was a literal job. Seneca mentions depilation a few times in his *Moral Epistles*. First off, in his letter that's best summed up as ""don't treat your slaves like shit. They're people too.""

> Another, who serves the wine, must dress like a woman and wrestle with his advancing years; he cannot get away from his boyhood; he is dragged back to it; and though he has already acquired a soldier’s figure, he is kept beardless by having his hair smoothed away or plucked out by the roots, and he must remain awake throughout the night, dividing his time between his master’s drunkenness and his lust; in the chamber he must be a man, at the feast a boy.

(A small reminder, Roman slavery was horrible. The above example is a small sample size of many, many horrors. Sen. *Epistulae*. 47.)

Then, in a slightly less grim context... (describing the noises that disturb the person who rents out an apartment above a bath - *Ep.* 57):

> Then, perhaps, a professional a comes along, shouting out the score; that is the finishing touch. Add to this the arresting of an occasional roysterer or pickpocket, the racket of the man who always likes to hear his own voice in the bathroom, or the enthusiast who plunges into the swimming-tank with unconscionable noise and splashing. **Besides all those whose voices, if nothing else, are good, imagine the hair-plucker with his penetrating, shrill voice,—for purposes of advertisement,—continually giving it vent and never holding his tongue except when he is plucking the armpits and making his victim yell instead.** Then the cake-seller with his varied cries, the sausageman, the confectioner, and all the vendors of food hawking their wares, each with his own distinctive intonation.

So yeah, the Romans plucked, pruned, shaved, groomed, and did what they thought looked pretty. Grouchier conservative voices would squawk about how gay it was, and the youth would wholeheartedly agree, making gay jokes at each other while getting their armpits plucked. 

If you have any questions, feel free to let me know!

574,AskHistorians,"In America pickled cucumbers are usually just called ""pickles"" and they are a kitchen staple. What caused pickled cucumbers to be so dominant compared to other pickled vegetables?","To cover a bit of the “obvious—” pickling has long been a tool for food preservation in the United States. Long before canning because a safe and reliable way to preserve foods, pickling (along with salting, drying, etc) was one of the most reliably safe ways to preserve fresh vegetables. While today pickled cucumbers reign supreme, most vegetables can be safely pickled and preserved several months for consumption. I wrote more about food preservation practices in the 19th century [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gqe25i/what_did_food_security_storage_look_like_in_the/).

Since pickled vegetables were such a common preservation technique, they appear in American cookbooks onwards from the earliest “American” cookbooks we have from the 18th century. The Virginia housewife, an early 1824 example of a “southern” regional cookbook, has a whole chapter on pickling. Likewise, the 1904 cookbook the Blue Grass Cookbook contains a whole chapter on “pickles,” and includes recipes for a whole range of pickled vegetables. Pickled cucumbers are referred to as such, while, for example, a “chopped pickle’ is a range of vegetables that have been pickled.

While both of these texts include recipes for pickled cucumbers, the classic “Dill pickle” owes its heritage to eastern European jewish immigrants who popularized the classic Dill Pickle. Even more than in the US, pickled vegetables were a staple to the eastern European diet, and immigrants continued to make and privilege eastern European pickle flavors. Frequently referenced in oral histories and memories are “sours” and “half sours,” types of pickled cucumbers distinguished by fermentation time. Pickles were fairly popular street foods, and became a staple of Jewish Delis in the city.

There is no source that definitely tells us when pickled cucumbers just became pickles. Community cookbooks, in the early-to mid 20th century, like the 1921 Durham Cook Book, often continued to have a section called “pickles” that included all manner of pickled vegetables. Pickled cucumbers were, largely, still referred to as pickled cucumbers.  While it wasn't yet ubiquitous, around this time, the term “pickle” was becoming increasingly associated with pickled cucumbers in the public eye. An excerpt Alfred Kazin’s Walker in the City refers to pickled sours and half sours as Pickles. While this is a recollection of the early 20th century, it was published in 1951. I am pretty confident in my understanding of the research on food preservation, but I could not find a single source that says with any certainty why we call pickled cucumbers pickles. There's a PBS article that take on the question but does not answer it. There’s no real definitive advertising campaign by a pickle company, no seminal sources, just a shifting conception of pickles over the early 20th century that pretty solidly gave way to the term ‘pickle’ being colloquially used to refer to pickled cucumbers by the mid 20th century. There was a 1893 advertising campaign at the Chicago World's Fair where Heinz company had ""pickle pins,"" so while it as clearly legible I've also found sources that postdate it that continue to specify pickled cucumber.

I’d like to be clear that my “answer” is just based of my knowledge of 19th and 20th century cookbooks and food preservation practices, and isn’t something I or anyone else I personally have found has made in a peer reviewed publication. But as sour and half sour pickles, which historically referred to an array of pickled eaters European vegetables but in the US referred mostly to pickled cucumbers made by Jewish immigrant communities, became a popular street food and part of the New York culinary lexicon that was later emulated by processed food companies, “sour and half sour” and “cucumber” was dropped from the name because cucumbers were just the most popular option for a pickled vegetable.  Companies, like Heinz, used it to refer to pickled cucumbers, cookbook authors began just calling pickled cucumbers pickles by the 1920s and 30s.

I know this isn't a perfect answer but I hope it helps, and I welcome anyone to tell me what I'm missing!

Also, let it be known, I have found no AskHistorian question I've tried to answer more deceptively difficult to answer."
575,AskHistorians,"A college professor once told our class, ""WWII was essentially two major wars, one between Russia and Germany, the other between Japan and China, along with a series of comparatively small territorial conflicts surrounding them."" Is this assessment fair?","I don’t see that there’s any other answer than ‘it depends’. More particularly, it depends on why your teacher has decided to frame the Second World War in this way.

I’m coming at this from a perspective of someone who studies (and teaches) a conflict whose relationship to the Second World War is quite debatable. A classic exam-style question for college students who study modern European history is ‘Was the Spanish Civil War the opening phase of the Second World War?’. It’s asked not because there is a right or wrong answer, but because it depends entirely on how you define the crucial issues at stake, and you can make a valid argument either way. For instance, if the Second World War is defined as an anti-fascist war, then it makes sense to view Spain as the beginning of this wider conflict; the opening blows in a wider ideological war. But if the Second World War is about something else – not least because the war in Asia and the Pacific doesn’t map neatly into a fascist/anti-fascist divide – then it no longer makes sense to view Spain as part of the same conflict. Your exam answer depends entirely on the frame of reference you want to adopt.

In this case, I can think of several reasons why someone might want to frame the conflict in the ways that your teacher wanted to. For instance, in terms of simple arithmetic, these are the theatres that saw the highest numbers of deaths. For both Germany and Japan, I believe there’s a case to be made that these were considered the most important fronts to achieve their aims, and generally saw the largest allocation of resources, though I’d gladly defer to an expert on either war effort on the extent this held true over time. Equally, there are reasons why it’s spurious – the influence of the United States, especially in terms of industrial production, was far too large to entirely discount in this way. The territory and populations that were won and lost in the ‘comparatively small’ conflicts were massive by any reasonable standard, and those that suffered occupation, displacement, exploitation and extermination could justifiably challenge any version of the conflict that so blithely downplayed their experiences.

But more importantly, I think, there’s a pedagogical case to be made for radically reframing the conflict for students. I don’t think any conflict has been the subject of national myth-making to the extent that the Second World War has, from the Battle of Britain, to Omaha Beach, to the French Resistance and more. There is a tendency to emphasise certain national perspectives, which in turn often leads to distorted impressions of how the war was won or lost. Challenging students’ understanding of what was important about the Second World War, going beyond the frame of reference that is provided in popular culture and high school history, is a useful way of showing students that things can look very different from perspectives other than the ones we grew up with. In other words, showing that studying history is not just about memorising dates and events, but being critical and flexible in how we approach the past.

Tl;dr: if your professor has presented this view as divine truth, then there are many reasons to question it. But if, as seems more likely, they are challenging you to rethink the way you’ve framed the Second World War up until now, then they're just doing their job."
576,AskHistorians,So we’re watching The Return of the King and I have just one question...who would clean up the fields of dead bodies after a big battle?,"It would differ from time, place, and circumstances.

Courtesy of /u/Iphikrates, the ancient Greeks, at least in the Classical period, repatriated their war dead for public burial. The exception was the Spartans, who buried them on the battlefield.

Tacitus describes Germanicus arriving at the scene of the battle of Teutoburg forest six years after the event [thus](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D61):
>Germanicus upon this was seized with an eager longing to pay the last honour to those soldiers and their general, while the whole army present was moved to compassion by the thought of their kinsfolk and friends, and, indeed, of the calamities of wars and the lot of mankind. Having sent on Cæcina in advance to reconnoitre the obscure forest-passes, and to raise bridges and causeways over watery swamps and treacherous plains, they visited the mournful scenes, with their horrible sights and associations. Varus's first camp with its wide circumference and the measurements of its central space clearly indicated the handiwork of three legions. Further on, the partially fallen rampart and the shallow fosse suggested the inference that it was a shattered remnant of the army which had there taken up a position. In the centre of the field were the whitening bones of men, as they had fled, or stood their ground, strewn everywhere or piled in heaps. Near, lay fragments of weapons and limbs of horses, and also human heads, prominently nailed to trunks of trees. In the adjacent groves were the barbarous altars, on which they had immolated tribunes and first-rank centurions. Some survivors of the disaster who had escaped from the battle or from captivity, described how this was the spot where the officers fell, how yonder the eagles were captured, where Varus was pierced by his first wound, where too by the stroke of his own ill-starred hand he found for himself death. They pointed out too the raised ground from which Arminius had harangued his army, the number of gibbets for the captives, the pits for the living, and how in his exultation he insulted the standards and eagles.

To give some examples from my area, Takeda Shingen was laying siege to Shiga castle in 1547 when the *Kantō Kanrei* sent an army to relief the castle. Shingen sent a detachment to face the relieve force, and the Takeda won. Afterwhich the Takeda took the heads of the 3000 dead from the relief force and laid them out for the Shiga castle garrison to see. In general though they would've been buried. After Sekigahara, for instance, Ieyasu paid 1000 *koku* to the samurai in charge of the area and had him take care of burying the dead and fixing any damaged temples. After the Siege of Ōsaka, a merchant camp follower by the name of Okamoto Saburōemon, known by his shop of Yodoya, volunteered to take care of burying the dead bodies, in return for the right to strip and sell the valuables he find. In Japan it seem to be custom to bury the dead and build at least a shrine for the dead and give offerings, like [this one at Sekigahara](https://www.google.com/maps/uv?pb=!1s0x6003cb3a4fbea5e9%3A0xbfc6b14d3fef3243!3m1!7e115!4shttps%3A%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMyM6fvUuTfimiI9ysoW_KHkkIifog8obZrdN7s%3Dw213-h160-k-no!5z6KW_6aaW5aGaIC0gR29vZ2xlIOaknOe0og!15sCgIgAQ&imagekey=!1e10!2sAF1QipMyM6fvUuTfimiI9ysoW_KHkkIifog8obZrdN7s&hl=ja&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZvtL9mejrAhWjyYsBHRwYB_kQoiowCnoECBkQBg), or at least [a little plaque](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E5%8D%83%E4%BA%BA%E5%A1%9A/@35.2476715,137.2702652,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipNJ1ayZ8DcTIGS_pBqIxn5G-7p5RqPCx46HYVpY!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipNJ1ayZ8DcTIGS_pBqIxn5G-7p5RqPCx46HYVpY%3Dw203-h151-k-no!7i2288!8i1712!4m8!1m2!2m1!1z5Y2D5Lq65aGa!3m4!1s0x0:0x239e27903621e251!8m2!3d35.2475818!4d137.2703934) for the dead of a supposed 1467 battle, so the dead don't haunt you.

For the longest time, the people of Aizuwakamatsu held a grudge against the people of Kagoshima (Satsuma) and Yamaguchi (Chōshū) for invading them in 1868 during the Boshin War. One of the widespread stories is that the defeated locals wanted to bury their dead, but the government forbade it. This has been proven false in recent years, as documents came to light [that after Aizu surrendered, the government ordered four Aizu samurai to organize the burial of 567 dead](https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASKB24DYRKB2UGTB004.html) showing the dead were actually buried. In this case the victors had the defeated take care of the burial, and the legend show what the people thought should (and in this case, actually did) happen."

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/564gvm/comment/d8g92dz/).

Specifically:

It's old but I will also link to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1nj5uj/was_the_holocaust_unique/ccja56t/) by u/400-rabbits on Stannard, which adds a bit of complexity - there are multiple historic Holocausts and they are all unique, if interrelated.

One thing I will add in addition to those answers is that when one is comparing the Holocaust to Indigenous peoples of the Americas, you're dealing with vastly different things in terms of time and scale - it's not just a numbers game. When we are talking about indigenous peoples of the Americas, we are discussing hundreds of different groups, who had very different experiences at the hands of different actors. Which is to say it makes it hard to talk about a singular ""genocide"" - the answer from u/EdHistory101 specifically focuses on the United States government in the 19th and 20th centuries, but that is part of a much larger history of conflict and dispossession of indigenous peoples lasting from the 1490s to [literally this very moment](https://www.survivalinternational.org/brazilgenocide), involving a vast array of actors. To be more comparable you'd probably need to compare the entire history of European anti-semitism from 1492 to the present. 

The Holocaust itself is historically a much more concentrated event, involving one government as a prime mover (the NSDAP regime in Germany), which intentionally targeted Jews in Europe for industrialized mass killing, most of which took place over a three year period during the war (ETA a 2019 study found 25% of Holocaust victims were actually murdered in a [three month period](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6314819/)). Not only was this genocide extremely intentional and organized and planned to an exceptional level of detail, but Germany made it an overriding policy objective, even in its relations with friendly/allied countries - there were even low-level discussions between German and Japanese officials about the possibility of murdering the 20,000 Jewish refugees in Shanghai (the Japanese refused). 

However, even with that said I should point out via this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/pyuvqy/how_true_is_the_claim_that_the_united_states_of/) that there is an ongoing historic debate at the moment as to how much white settlement of the Americas directly inspired Nazi policies and goals in Eastern Europe."
579,AskHistorians,How accurate is Monty Python's 'Anarcho-Syndicalist Peasant' scene? Were small medieval villages de-facto self governing and autonomous from their noble lord and wider nation?,"There will be more to say, and doubtless other examples to proffer, but perhaps the medieval ""peasant republic"" of Dithmarschen is the closest fit for the sort of community you are envisaging.

Located on the North Sea coastline in the marshy confluence of what is now the borderlands of Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, Dithmarschen was an ethnically Saxon enclave in a part-Danish, part- Frisian border district that lay within the perpetually-contested border between Denmark and the Holy Roman Empire.

This poor, low-lying and swampy district endured as what was to all intents and purposes an independent polity for 330 years, from 1227 to 1559, and was – according to William Urban, author of the only study of the place in English – a ""unique"" society whose ""form of government violated nearly every generalization made about the medieval period.""

This was not an area of much strategic significance, and nor was it an hospitable environment:

>The coast is largely marsh – salty, forbidding, and ever-changing under the lash of storm and tide... The climate has proved to be both friend and foe to every person who has lived along that coast. The winters are long and dreary. Rain and fog cover the low-lying landscape for months at a time. A cold wetness permeates the stoutest covering. The meadows can become seas of mud. Winters are often a succession of terrible storms, breaking dikes and overwhelming the work of decades and generations... The wind is ever-present and powerful in ways that only sailors and inhabitants of the Great Plains can understand. No great woods, no quiet valleys exist. Instead, there is a feeling of unlimited space and open skies...

Nonetheless, the area did incorporate some rich farmland, and in the springs and summers ""the meadows and marshes blossomed forth in magnificent abundance"" that made the little territory covetable to some. According to Urban, Dithmarschen owed its independence largely to a power vacuum that emerged in the district as a result of the severe defeat of the Danish King Valdemar the Conqueror at the Battle of Bornhöved in July 1227 – a loss apparently occasioned by the precipitous retreat of a contingent of Dithmarscher infantry which was supposed to be covering the king's cavalry. Whatever their culpability in the matter, the local peasants put the disaster to good use, reaching an agreement with the Archbishop of Hamburg which involved them recognising him as their lord without actually conceding effective sovereignty, retaining, as a result, ""such autonomy as to be practically self-governing."" The Dithmarschers subsequently built their own *dom*, or cathedral, in the small town of Meldorp, and this building became, after about 1300, the seat of their quasi-independent peasant government.

Broadly, Urban argues, Dithmarschen was a clan-based society which owed its effective independence to a combination of ongoing chaos in the Holy Roman Empire, which prevented serious steps being taken to curtail the minor irritation caused by the existence of a small community of independent-minded peasants living in a hard-to-get-at marsh, and an obscure victory won by its peasant clans over the local petty nobility as a result of the so-called Rabbit War of 1289.

To take the external developments first: once the Danish border had been pushed north in 1227, the main temporal rulers in the area were the counts of Holstein. Their territory was broken up and divided between sons on two separate occasions, in 1263 and 1290, weakening what was left of the county to the point where it had no real ability to impose itself militarily on its neighbours. For his part, meanwhile, the bishop of Hamburg devoted most of his resources to attempting to improve his tax base by bringing the much richer peasants living south of the Elbe under his control. Dithmarschen took advantage of this situation, paying ""a small contribution"" to the archbishop every year, and studiously refraining from provoking him into serious military action in return ""for guarantees that they would be permitted to practice the self-government they believed to be essential to their way of life."" After 1329, the taxes owed to Hamburg amounted to no more than a one-off payment of 500 marks made by the Dithmarschers to each new bishop at the time of his election, ""after which they would wish him a long life and have almost no other obligations."" In the same period, the peasants of Dithmarschen established a long-lasting informal alliance with the Hanseatic port of Lübeck, across the Jutland peninsula to their east, which over the next two centuries provided them with both an outlet for surplus goods and a source of imports – not least weaponry. The presence of other small independent polities nearby, by the way, is a reminder not only that the Holy Roman Empire in this period comprised dozens, and eventually hundreds, of political units, among which it was almost always possible to find allies to band together with against common enemies, but also that Dithmarschen itself was not nearly so anomalous an entity, nor so threatening to the contemporary political order, as it might have been had it existed inside a more centralised state such as England – a factor that doubtless helps to explain the republic's considerable longevity.

Within Dithmarschen, meanwhile, political power continued to reside in the hands of a class of petty nobles, the ""serf-knights"" (*ministeriale*), most of whom had risen from the ranks of the more well-to-do local peasantry themselves. These men held most of the administrative positions within Ditchmarschen, but lacked the right to claim hereditary control over these offices. In the aftermath of the Rabbit War, most of the members of this group were forced into exile in Holstein (c.1290), while others chose to stay in the district and form their own clan, the Vodiemannen (literally ""advocates""), and were absorbed into the local peasant society. From then on, according to Urban and F.C. Dahlmann, Ditchmarschen's government comprised an annual assembly of elders and clan chiefs, which met at Meldorp once a year ""to make laws for the entire land."" Because these meetings were short, and focused largely on the urgent practicalities of dike-building and maintenance, and because there were well over 100 rival clans within the marshlands, it was almost impossible to pass comprehensive packages of legislation, and although a written constitution did gradually emerge (it is this, Urban argues, that gives Dithmarschen its claim to be considered a genuinely independent polity), no one clan could dominate even at a parish level without causing an alliance of rival families to form against it. The result was that the average Dithmarscher parish was in most respects independent from its neighbours, and the average peasant living in one of those parishes was a free man who farmed his own land and lived a life about as close to that of the ""anarcho-syndicalist peasant"" of *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* as any did in Europe, joining together with his neighbours only to resist the infrequent military incursions launched against Dithmarschen by its neighbours."
580,AskHistorians,"In the movie ""Seven Samurai"" the main characters stay in a house built on a small creek. One corner of the house is left open to let water flow into the living space. Was this a common feature of Japanese homes in the 1500s?","Hey there!  I don't know that I qualify as an expert, but as an architect who loves and has studied Japanese architecture a good bit I'll try and provide some background for your question.  

>Was there a purpose or meaning behind this feature?

So two things here.  For purpose we must consider the practicality of such a feature and Japanese domestic life at the time.  For meaning we must consider aesthetic and spiritual matters in Japanese domestic life at the time.  

On the practicality side of things, consider that in the 1500's there was no indoor plumbing.  It seems like an obvious statement but when you need to get your water from either a nearby above ground water source or a well, having it immediately at hand in your home would be super convenient.  I have to admit here that it's been years since I've seen Seven Samurai and I don't recall the feature you're mentioning, so I'm kind of presuming off of what I know about traditional home design, but was the creek in the kitchen or the living space?  Generally homes were built up off the ground except for some spaces like the kitchen which would be on the ground with a dirt floor.  Having a creek pass through here would be simple and useful.  

Now, if the creek were in the living space it is less likely that it was a practical feature so much as an aesthetic one, and aesthetics were a *big deal* back then.  To understand traditional Japanese homes you first need to understand the term Wabi Sabi.  Wabi Sabi was an aesthetic philosophy that grew up after the introduction of Buddhism in Japan which celebrated the beauty of things like decay, loneliness, etc.  I know that sounds grim, it wasn't really viewed that way.  It had to do with a recognition of the impermanence of all things, a reverence for self-sacrifice in the name of spiritual awakening, and a respect for nature.  In Wabi Sabi, a mug that is irregular/warped and the color of natural clay would be prized above a perfectly round mug glazed in the latest fashions of China (and make no mistake, some of the drive for Wabi Sabi was a nationalistic response to cultural influence from China).  A Wabi Sabi philosopher might love and appreciate a particular half-decayed leaf they come upon in the right context, or the patina slowly overcoming a bronze bell, etc.  The loneliness aspect too was meant to embody the image of a monk living in a rough cabin in the woods away from society, finding peace and deliverance in nature; rather than a more sort of despondent loneliness.  Per Buddhism, it's about appreciation and acceptance of the world around you rather than trying to impose your will over it.  So back to an aesthetic indoor creek - this would serve as a constant reminder of Wabi Sabi, reflecting both the constant passage of time (you can never step in the same creek twice) and serving as an indoor reminder of the natural world.  

>Seems like it would be quite cold in the winters.

This has a related answer to the above when you further examine how Japanese homes were made and lived in.  Part of the acceptance of decay and nature wrapped into Wabi Sabi is an acceptance and appreciation for discomfort.  The traditional Japanese house is generally made of a wood frame with thin wood walls.  In richer examples, the wood would be expertly crafted and the walls would consist of a row of doors with paper screens, called Shoji, that could be opened or even completely removed to appreciate the outdoors and gardens surrounding the house.  In poorer areas as can be seen in the movie, the walls would be maybe rough wood plank, woven branches, or perhaps mud.  A non-Wabi Sabi reason for this is that wood-framed homes like that stand up better to earthquakes which were frequent.  The frame was better able to flex and sway with the quake to minimize the risk of collapse - and if it did collapse was cheaper to rebuild and would do a minimum of damage on the way down.  Stone/brick walls, or even mud ones, can't flex and would crumble in an earthquake.  But all of this is to say that Japanese homes are *already* quite cold in the winter.  Residents would get through this by dressing more warmly, using small coal braziers to warm the room you're in (or kotatsu, which are a table with a small coal brazier underneath and blankets surrounding it that you can lay in and which capture the heat), and just generally accepting being cold (wabi-sabi).  Also keep in mind that Japan is a very large country - southern Japan has a very mild climate compared to the northern regions.  I don't know where in Japan Seven Samurai happened off the top of my head, or if Kurosawa even gave it a ""place"" in the country.  

A few sources for further reading I would recommend if you really want to understand this topic more in-depth:

**Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings** is one of my favorites.  It was written by Ed Morse back in the 1800's when it was very popular for Westerners to travel Japan and write books about it.  His is notable for an *amazing* collection of sketches he did while there documenting everything he could about the houses he stayed in.  He was also one of the last of his type to do that sort of journey before Japan began to feel the heavy cultural impact of Westernization.  The whole thing can be read online [here](http://www.kellscraft.com/JapaneseHomes/JapaneseHomesContentPage.html) but paper copies aren't too expensive either.


**Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers** by Leonard Koren does a great job introducing the concepts of Wabi Sabi for a Western mind.  

**In Praise Of Shadows** by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki was a long essay written by a famous Japanese author around the time Kurosawa was making his films where he praised what he saw as Japanese aeshtetic and lamented the impact the Western world had on Japan.  Particularly he frames his essay around the contrast for the West's love of light and cleanliness with the Wabi Sabi love of shadow.  

**The Lessons of Japanese Architecture** by Jiro Harada is a very approachable breakdown of a lot of traditional Japanese architecutre

**Measure and Construction of the Japanese House** by Heino Engel is a more deep-dive into the practicalities of house design and construction.

As an aside, I love Kurosawa's movies so I was glad to see this question.  One of my favorite things about his work is his dedication to representing the old lifestyle as accurately as possible as a framework for his stories, even going so far as to rent out preserved ""museum towns"" that have been kept unchanged for centuries, and filming his entire movies in them.  It's so cool to see how the old buildings were used as part of a daily lifestyle rather than to just read about it."
581,AskHistorians,How accurate is Outlander's depiction of Louis XV's mistress and her revealing dress and piercings? Did such an outfit ever exist during Louis XV's lifetime?,"It's not accurate.

To deal with the revealing dress issue first:

Whether or not women sometimes revealed their nipples in public is still under discussion among fashion historians. There are several French fashion prints from the eighteenth century that show women with their nipples on display, but they're problematic to interpret: for instance, [Little Mother at a Meeting in the Champs Elysées](http://www.mimicofmodes.com/2012/10/galerie-des-modes-11e-cahier-3e-figure.html) and [Young middle class woman dressed in a Polonaise ](http://www.mimicofmodes.com/2012/10/galerie-des-modes-11e-cahier-5e-figure.html), both from the *Galerie des Modes* in 1778. The first example here is sexually-charged even without the exposure - this is a young woman, alone, meeting someone for a ""*rendez-vous*"" in a grove off of a fashionable avenue - and the *Galerie* has a habit of leaning on eroticism in poses and descriptions. (""The pose of this governess prevents her fine leg from being seen; her breast is lily-white and covered by a ruffled handkerchief, but it can be found by Lubin,"" is my favorite example of completely unnecessary sexy description.) As all of the people upvoting this question can attest, images of and talk of breasts produces results! Other examples of commercial prints that show women with exposed nipples seem to combine satire and sex appeal, such as [A Peep into Brest with a Navel Review](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2003675459/), a bawdy joke about the British naval campaign against France in the Atlantic, in which the Lord Admiral patrolled near Brest to keep an eye on the French, or are just an excuse for voyeurism, such as [L'Essai du Corset](https://research.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1440424&partId=1), which doubles the voyeurism by letting the viewer look at the men looking at the woman in the print.

What the costume designer may have been drawing on was costumes from the seventeenth century. Sketches made by Inigo Jones for masques at the English courts of James I and then Charles I in the 1600s-1630s exist - you can see two of them [here at the British Library](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/inigo-jones-designs-for-masque-costumes), and an Elizabethan costuming website hosts [a greater number, taken from two books on Jones's work](http://elizabethancostume.net/masque/index.html). (I've also found [a blog with even more images](http://jeannedepompadour.blogspot.com/2012/04/costumes-by-inigo-jones-and-bernardo.html), but there's no indication of the source for the images.) The costumes for female masquers frequently feature a tight-fitting bodice with a U-shaped cutout under each breast, much like the gown used in *Outlander*, though there is often a little light veiling used for support. These designs may have been used to emphasize the physical femininity of the performers in these private theatricals, in comparison to the men who were allowed to play women on the public stage. Either way, there's no evidence that the tradition continued to the later seventeenth century, let alone the mid-eighteenth - and we don't even know how closely these sketches were followed at the time, as no costumes survive. [A miniature of Queen Henrietta Maria in a costume by Jones from 1632](https://www.rct.uk/collection/themes/exhibitions/in-fine-style/the-queens-gallery-buckingham-palace/queen-henrietta-maria-1609-1669) certainly shows no such license - her neckline is very respectable, and filled in with a partlet - though a miniature of [a lady playing ""Flora""](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Portrait_of_a_lady,_dressed_as_Flora_by_Isaac_Oliver.png) does show the extremely low ""neckline"".

As far as nipple piercings go - there is no good evidence for them before the twentieth century. There is a lot of writing out there in pop histories of tattooing and piercing that asserts things we have no sources for, or that we have very tenuous evidence for. To quote from [a previous answer of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5p26hr/whats_the_history_of_sexual_peircings_nipple/dcom56i/), 

>>Queen Isabella of Bavaria popularized ""garments of the grand neckline"" that were open down to the belly-button and led to women rouging and piercing their nipples

>First, her name is more commonly given as ""Isabeau"", so that is a good clue that the many representations of the story are coming from a single, unscholarly/uninformed source. Isabeau was married to Charles VI of France, and was frequently a part of courtly diplomacy and the mediation of disputes between powerful aristocrats; when her husband began to decline into mental illness, she took on more responsibility and acted as regent. Eventually civil war broke out, and in the disorder Henry V was able to swoop in and win the famous Battle of Agincourt.

>If you're at all familiar with the history of women actively involved in royal politics, it's probably not that surprising to learn that after she died, commentators enthusiastically condemned her and created a reputation of decadence, lust, debauchery, and incompetence out of whole cloth. I haven't been able to track the story about piercings to a specific primary source, but if it exists it's almost certainly part of this tradition. (Isabeau is a pretty interesting figure and if you'd like to learn more about her, I suggest Tracy Adams's The Life and Afterlife of Isabeau of Bavaria.)

>>There was a fad for ""bosom rings"" in the late 1890s in Paris and London.

>The only evidence that this fad ever existed appears to be certain letters printed in English periodicals (*Society*, *The Family Doctor and People's Medical Advisor*, *English Mechanic and the World of Science*) in 1899. They were intermixed with correspondence about savage boarding schools, whippings, tight-lacing, and high heels that Dr. Valerie Steele considers to be examples of fetish fiction rather than real exposés, and most likely do not represent real practices. Essentially, r/thathappened material (or Penthouse letters) of the 19th century.

The designer for *Outlander* is certainly accomplished, but this is the first production in her profile on IMDB that is set before the twentieth century. There are a number of inaccurate costumes in the show, largely based on unfamiliarity with the period and an interpretation of artwork without a full understanding of the context around it, as well as the fact that costume designers aren't fashion historians and don't have the same goals or needs.

A couple of sources:

I should give credit to [Isis Wardrobe](http://isiswardrobe.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-bared-bosom-in-17th-and-18th.html) for putting me on to several of these visual sources. For those who actually click the link: yes, that blog post is arguing the opposite of what I'm arguing. I simply disagree with the conclusions because I think the context of the artwork (as something to be marketed or make a point) undercuts is value as proof of everyday behavior."
582,AskHistorians,How were protest signs in the 30s-50s U.S. so beautifully designed and lettered?,"The examples you point to are (presumably based on their quality and regularity, provability is hard in specific cases here) signs made by professional letterers and signmakers — an industry that was much more common and pervasive in the 30s, 40s, and 50s than today. Large and well-organized protests in this time period would employ or acquire via professional volunteers signage like the ones you use as examples. (A modern equivalent might be having a WordPress website set up for your protest: It's a common professional skill and not as expensive or difficult to acquire as you might think.) 

(If your question is more of a technical one: These signs weren't all individually hand-lettered. A professional lettering artist makes one copy, then the artwork is photographed and turned into a plate for silkscreening or lithography.)

Signage was seen as part of branding a cause, and this professional approach intersected well with the Madison-Avenue advertising culture of the day. In addition to hand-lettered signage like your examples, there are famous examples of professionally printed protest signs such as the ""[I Am a Man](https://imgur.com/a/rWdF0)"" signs (from a Memphis custodian protest) and [Malcolm X rallies](https://imgur.com/mpKcR7p) around various causes. Don't underestimate the resources available to well-organized events.

Starting in the 60s-70s and the counter-culture movement in America, signage even at larger events become much more home-grown and improvised. You'll see a lot more free expression in anti-Vietnam [protest signs in the 70s](https://imgur.com/a/iNzdi), for example — and again, this reflects a shift in the culture of expression of the times.

Of course, there has always been a range of home-grown signage alongside professionally-produced signage, these patterns are only generalizations. You can certainly see [home-grown signage from mid-century](https://imgur.com/a/ajwdk) and [professionally produced signs today](https://imgur.com/a/cpbiU).

Lastly, your question might actually just be one of aesthetics: There's little technical difference between how the signs in your example were produced and how BLM or Westboro Baptist Church signs are made. You may just personally think the lettering is nicer looking when it was done by hand, before computers. And I'd agree with you.  

Also: Protest art is a whole field of graphic design history and collection. For more, check out [The Art of Protest](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780816637713) by T.V. Reed. Artists and designers have always been part of political movements, it's an interesting lens through which to learn some social history.

583,AskHistorians,"The city of Rome had a population of over one million people at its apex, but by the year 1000 CE it had fallen to less than 20,000. Are there any surviving accounts of persons living in Rome from that period and what they thought of the massive ruins around them?","Textually, we have an incredibly rich trove of accounts of visitors to Rome.

> In Rome is also the palace of Vespasianus, a great and very strong building; also the Colosseum...There were battles fought here in olden times, and in the palace more than 100,000 men were slain, and there their bones remain piled up to the present day. The king caused to be engraved a representation of the battle and of the forces on either side facing one another, both warriors and horses, all in marble, to exhibit to the world the war of the days of old.

> In Rome there is a cave which runs underground, and catacombs...In the church of St. John in the Lateran there are two bronze columns taken from the Temple, the handiwork of King Solomon, each column being engraved ""Solomon the son of David."" The Jews of Rome told me that every year upon the 9th of Ab they found the columns exuding moisture like water.

Although Benjamin observes that some of Rome is standing/inhabited and some is ruins, he does not distinguish which is which in his description (nor does that distinction allow for, as we will see, inhabited ruins). However, he is keenly aware of the history of the ancient Roman buildings and those who lived in them. Those stories--what Rome *was*--matter more than what they *are*. He takes note of great buildings, natural features, and smaller monuments. I also think the detail about the columns of the Temple seized and appropriated into a Christian church are fascinating and significant. Especially in recounting the miracle story of the local Jewish community, Benjamin shows that Rome could have a sacred geography for *non*-Christians--something I, at least, am not used to thinking of.

Notably absent from Benjamin's record, on the other hand, is commentary on the *fall* of Rome. For this, believe it or not, we have to turn to Christian writers. In their stylings, a very real admiration for classical antiquity aligns with the medieval Christian theology of history that saw a ""world grown old,"" decaying towards apocalypse and only ever renewable by God. 11th-12th century cleric Hildebert of Lavardin, eventually archbishop of Tours, wrote two famous poems *de Roma* which both celebrate and mourn the ancient city as he found it at the very end of the 11th century. Here's an excerpt from one:

> The city now is fallen; I can find

> No worthier epitaph than “this was Rome.”

> Yet neither the flight of years, nor flame nor sword

> Could fully wipe away its loveliness

> […] Bring wealth, new marble, and the help of gods

> Let craftsmen’s hands be active in their work—

> Yet shall these standing walls no equal find,

> Nor can these ruins even be restored

> The care of men once built so great a Rome

> The care of gods could not dissolve its stones

> Divinities admire their faces carved,

> And wish themselves the equal of these forms

> Nature could not make gods as fair of face

> As man created images of gods

With Hildebert, praises of Rome move into a more emotional register, but also a more intellectual one rather than practical/geographical. His words are grounded in ancient Rome's buildings and especially its art but he evokes the splendor of a lost civilization rather than the immediate materiality of buildings rooted in history. It's also significant that Hildebert's praise, while overtly of the artistic qualities of ancient Roman art, is actually directed at the *human artists*. He elevates the abilities of humans of old especially compared to present ones, whose skills and vision could never possibly measure up.

A few years later, the English traveler known as Master Gregory famously followed Hildebert's footsteps to Rome. Gregory actually knew one of Hildebert's poems--he quotes it in his own little travel guide-like account!--but takes his commentary a step further.

> The sight of the whole city is, I think, most wonderful, where there is such a multitude of towers, so great a number of palaces, as none can count. When I first saw the city from far off, I was overwhelmed and remembered Caesar's view of it, when having conquered the Gauls and crossed the Alps, he exclaimed *substantial quote from Caesar*...

> This beauty passing understanding I long admired, and I thanked God who...yet has magnified there the works of man with immeasurable beauty. For even if Rome falls into complete ruin, nothing that is intact can be compared with it. As has been said [by Hildebert, in fact]:

> *Nothing can equal Rome, Rome even in ruins*

> *Your ruins speak aloud your former greatness*

> **The ruin of Rome shows clearly, I think, that all temporal things are near their end, especially when the worldly center of all things, Rome, daily languishes and decays.**

Rome as the ""worldly"" center of the word is one of those little noteworthy turns of phrase. In medieval Christian *sacred* geography, the center of the world was Jerusalem. Here, though, Gregory focuses on the human component in Christian world/salvation history--and he is even more explicit than Hildebert about the decline of the present from earlier greatness.

We're used to a ""decline and fall of Rome"" narrative as Christians supposedly ruining the great rationality/progress/technology of pagan/philosophical Rome. Medieval Christians actually took part in the view of a Roman golden age compared to their own; for them, however, the rise of Christianity was less a *cause* of decline than an inevitable step towards ultimate divine redemption.

Gregory relates one more detail I want to highlight here: he tells us that many of the statues from the days of pagan Roman glory were dismantled by (very important) Pope Gregory I! We can agree on one hand it's quite noteable that he's repeating a story about Christians actively opposing the preservation of pagan art, and not very approvingly. On the other, this Gregory projects the 'desecration' onto another Gregory several centuries in the past.

In fact, the appropriation and remixing of ancient Rome into a Christian city was *ongoing* throughout the Middle Ages. Even in the later 15th century, with ""Renaissance"" adulation of classical antiquity building to a fever pitch, prelates in Rome were still plunder the Colosseum and deserted palaces for stones for their own lavish building projects!

This brings us to the last thing I want to talk about: archaeological evidence for ""what people thought"" of Roman ruins, evidence that perhaps helps us get beyond the view of the absolute elite of the elite of high medieval society. The Colosseum is the famous example here, since it enjoyed many afterlives throughout the Middle Ages. Most famously, it eventually became a little neighborhood for artisans! Quarrymen and blacksmiths set up residence, even building the occasional shop for horseshoes and other goods. Eventually, a monastery was constructed in and around part of it. And all the while, tantalizing blocks of stone were usurped for building projects elsewhere.

Visitors to Rome saw ""ruins"" and ""desertion,"" and the ashes of of past splendor. People who lived in Rome may well have seen that, too. But they also saw promise for the present and the future: what could be out of what had been."
584,AskHistorians,Did people do blowjobs in the medieval times?,"Yes! Although the Church was not in favour of it, since it went against the 'natural purpose' of sex.

The Eleventh Century penitential known as the *Scriftboc* in Cotton Junius 121 contains the following penance:

>X02.04.01 Whoever releases seed into the mouth is to fast 7 winters.

You might think that's a particularly harsh penalty, and it's significantly more than those for sleeping with your slave (although that also carried secular consequences), and it's on par with the penance suggested for bestiality, although far less than that for incest.

It's interesting to note that there's no spiritual opprobrium for the (implied) woman actually *performing* the act; ostensibly the Church doesn't care what you get up to on the road to sex, it just wants you to *get there.* The penance is specifically for the man careless enough to blow his load before the main performance, so to speak."
585,AskHistorians,"The Middle Eastern folktale Aladdin was actually set in China, albeit a very Arabian version of China with viziers and djinns. Does this story reflect what the Middle East believed China to be like? How much of Chines culture was known to them?","Well, medieval travel writers knew that the Chinese used toilet paper.

But I'm getting ahead of myself here.

> There was, in days of yore and in ages and times long gone before, a powerful King among the Kings of China...He was wealthy as he was powerful, but he had grown old without being blessed with a son...At last, he sought the intercession of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!) with the Most High and implored Him, by the glory of His Prophets and Saints and Martyrs...that he would grant him a son.

> *-from ""The Craft and Malice of Women,"" Burton trans.*

""'Alā' ad-Dīn and the Wonderful Lamp"" is kind of an awkward text to work with. The manuscript tradition (...traditions) of the *1001 Nights* is a mess already--our earliest notions of the text are only 1000 nights, for starters, and no surviving copy gets close to having 1001 tales. But probably the most famous of the tales even before Disney has special problems, namely, it isn't actually part of that medieval manuscript tradition at all. The way medieval texts including/especially *1001 Nights* worked, that absolutely doesn't mean it's not just as deeply rooted as others. But when a story first shows up in the 17th/18th century as Europeans are getting their hands on the text, there's room for caution.

Fortunately, tales like the frame story ""The Craft and Malice of Women,"" which has an alternate title but why would you ever use it, serve as a fine substitute. The frame and some of its internal tales trace back through the Egyptian manuscript tradition, so we're good here.

I dumped a block quote on you at the beginning so you could situate yourself: we've got a ""King of the Kings"" of China (a title that medieval Arabic geographers use when talking about a land they're a bit more familiar with, Persia), an *ulema* or class of Muslim scholars, astrologers, philosophers, religious leaders, and--oh yeah--Islam. In other words, we're dealing with the trappings of medieval Islamic culture in this text, too.

But, well...this doesn't exactly coincide with what merchant, diplomats, and ethnographers are writing about China just about the same time people start writing down *1001 Nights* collections (or at least, ones that survive). For starters:

>  I do not know of a single member of [China or India] who is a Muslim, and Arabic is not spoken.

Our ninth-century informant adopted by 10th century author Abū Zayd al-Ḥasan al-Sīrāfī has more to say comparing the two lands:

> India is the land of medicine and of philosophers; the Chinese also have medical knowledge. Most of their medicine involves cauterization. In addition, they have a knowledge of astronomy and astrology, although this is more widespread in India.

Just from the *beginning* of the tale, then, it's clear that *The Craft and Malice of Women* is set in a fantastical China, not the actual one. The examples continue, like houses being made of stucco instead of wood. We'll return to the fantasy in a bit, because as promised: toilet paper.

Abū Zayd and whatever earlier accounts he's drawing on for the first book of his text (he probably doesn't know for sure and it may well have multiple sources; a later author attributes excerpts from it to a merchant called Sulayman) offer a surprisingly rich view of early medieval China. In the beginning of book two, in fact, Abū Zayd recounts a long history of a recent rebellion! But it's especially fascinating to see what details of Chinese culture the geographer-ethnographers and their sources emphasize.

> The Chinese are unhygienic, and they do not wash their backsides with water after defecating but merely wipe themselves with paper. 

Yeah, like that one.

Throughout the text, comparisons to Arab culture or other known cultures help the original readers understand China and help us understand why Abū Zayd et al. emphasize particular details.

> Their staple food is rice. They often cook a sauce to go with it, which they
pour on the rice before eating it. Their ruling classes, however, eat wheat
bread and the ﬂesh of all sorts of animals, including pigs and other such
creatures. 

Eating all meats is a big deal to the Muslim observer. Elsewhere, he compares Chinese religious practices to Zoroastrians. This is a good remind not to take everything at face value, though. Anna Akasoy has shown that ""Zoroastrianism"" (a twisted idea thereof) was a common framework through which Muslim ethnographers sought to understand foreign religions in, for example, West Africa.

Given the consternation we see on AskHistorians about medieval Muslims and alcohol, this is a particularly interesting observation:

> Their drink is a wine made from rice. Grape wine is not to
be found in their land, and it is never imported—indeed, they do not know of it and do not drink it. 

It looks like our author is quite familiar with wine made from grapes!

We also learn that the Chinese tax foreign imports at a 30% rate, have a fiscal bureaucracy staffed by eunuchs, and place an enormous premium on reading and writing. I'll include another passage that's a popular interest topic on AskHistorians: a sort of premodern passport:

> Anyone wanting to travel from one part of China to another obtains two documents.
The document from the ruler is a permit for the road, made out in the name
of the traveler and those accompanying him, and stating his age and his
companions’ ages, and the tribe from which he comes...The second document concerns the traveler’s money and any goods he may have. 

> The reason for this
procedure is that there are guardposts on the road where they examine both
documents, and, when a traveler arrives at one, they write, ""So-and-so, son
of So-and-so, of Such-and-such an origin, arrived at our guardpost on the
nth day of the nth month of the nth year, accompanied by So-and-so."" This
is in order that none of the traveler’s money or goods should go missing.

I don't have to tell you not to take all this as surah truth about early medieval China. In most cases we're dealing with multiple layers of transmission, and a culture where repeating earlier stories was as good as firsthand observation/often treated as firsthand observation. Nevertheless, modern scholars generally consider the fact-checkable points somewhat reliable--at least, much more so than contemporary accounts like *The Wonders of India*, a fascinating collection of sailors' stories in which basically everyone gets shipwrecked on a island of Amazons or cannibals.

I've already mentioned the difficult heritage of this text. It survives in one damanged manuscript copy today. But we know that whoever wrote it in the 9th century, it was read and copied in the 10th by Abū Zayd and by the Persian scholar Ibn
al-Faqīh. In other words, in the Middle Ages, this text got around a little!

But then we have to balance the scholars versus the storytellers. When we talk about ""medieval Muslims' knowledge of China,"" we shouldn't just think about the best-connected. While obviously also not everyone was reading *1001 Nights* itself, the ubiquity of many of its stories around the Mediterranean world suggests a much more common currency for them than for Abū Zayd.

And don't let the insertion of Islam, science, kings, and harems--perfectly ordinary elements of life to medieval Muslims!--fool you. The China of the *1001 Nights* is a China ""days of yore and in ages and times long gone before""--it's stocked full of the magic that, even if not the *specific* story of Ala ad-Din, the same air of exoticism and, dare I say it, Orientalism."
586,AskHistorians,"I am a lady in Tudor England. I have enjoyed my ""wifely duties"" and wish to do them again, but my husband continually rejects me. What are my options?","There’s a lot that can be said about marriage in Tudor times, which looked different depending on what social class you belonged to. My initial response is thinking through you, as a wife dissatisfied with the lack of physical attention, could argue your way out of a marriage if it was never consummated; the most famous example from your timeframe is from King Henry VIII, who used it to annul his marriage to Anne of Cleves.

but wait! Tudor was a Christian time (albeit changing denomination loyalties)! Clearly a wife needs to be married to enjoy her wifely duties, no?

Technically yes, but in reality such stark rules regarding sex (ie it’s only ever done after marriage) were ignored to a high degree. This time in England saw countless shotgun weddings, with estimates placing one in three brides as pregnant by Elizabethan times. The ladies enjoyed sex quite a bit and this was no secret — when the 52 year old king of France married a teenager, and then passed away a mere three months into the marriage, sympathies laid with him, for she must have worn him out in the bedroom for his death to come a-knocking.

If a wife wants to know her options for fulfilling her sexual appetites (besides, of course, extramarital affairs) that part of the good book you bring up wouldn’t have helped her much. Women’s rights in Tudor England were inferior to a man’s so that part of the Bible verse was generally ignored, a pastime most Christians have indulged in throughout recorded history. Yet Tudor England did allow for the nuclear option of divorce in some narrow circumstances, even allowing the woman in the marriage to bring it forth! If the husband was denying his wife sex because he became impotent, that would be grounds enough for divorce (though the onus would be on the wife to actually prove it). 

Of the four other reasons for divorce - including the aforementioned never consummating it, cruelty, adultery, and constant quarrels - the wife, if she was a persuasive sort, might have tried to argue it was cruel to leave her sexually starved, or that they argued constantly over how frequently their bedsport took place. I say “argue” because divorce was uncommon and never guaranteed; as one historian puts it, “death was the only sure release from unhappy marriage”.

Divorce being a non-starter in most cases, it’s not like the law forces husbands to perform when they don’t choose to. Our theoretical wife in question doesn’t have access to modern-day couples therapy; the closest she could get is discussing matters over with a priest, who, if he too believed strongly in the biblical command to a wife’s sexual pleasure, might seek to help them get livelier in the bedroom. This could work as the clergy had certain beliefs about a woman’s needs: “The Church believed that women were constantly craving sexual intercourse and that if they did not have sex they could get very sick. Thus it was important that after marriage a man had sexual intercourse with his wife not only to produce children but to keep her under control.”

But generally two things would resolve it before that took place: one, spouses were very close with both holding great power so they could simply talk things through to find an optimal, sexy solution. Two: while sex was important, it wasn’t a cultural priority. Love was not seen as this enduring lifelong state. When love (which encompasses sexual passion) faded, you still had to stay together no matter how dissatisfied you were. Which is to say, your sexual pleasure did not come close to what you prioritize in a marriage. If this wife has an otherwise agreeable marriage and relationship, she would have been expected to simply soldier on. After all, we all have our crosses to bear; this one may as well be hers.

587,AskHistorians,What was married sex life like before birth control?,"This is a tricky question to answer, because while society was never as squeamish as moderns imagine, people simply didn't explicitly, rigorously document their own sex lives (apart from certain notable examples like Anne Lister). In particular, we always have a hard time finding out about the private lives of women and the working classes.

>The most effective method was probably coitus interruptus and regular breastfeeding and as we know, compared to modern contraceptives, those have a low success rate at preventing pregnancy.

Prior to the advent of reliable, accessible modern birth control, men and women were acutely aware that sexual intercourse was very likely to lead to pregnancy. The *most* effective method at the time was simply to not have sex at all or infrequently (perhaps once a week) - abstinence - and despite the jokes about teaching that as birth control today, there is evidence that changes in at least English fertility rates were affected by deliberate attempts to limit family size. That is, abstinence on the part of women: men, particularly in urban areas, would have found it quite easy to meet sex workers, whom they paid to take on the responsibility of a possible pregnancy. Unfortunately, it's impossible to tell how many couples agreed to abstinence together and how many involved a husband stepping out on his wife, but there is a great decline in fertility over the nineteenth century and early twentieth that simply can't be explained with the contraceptives available at the time.

We do see a number of wives in the nineteenth century that have several pregnancies close together at the beginning of their marriage, then a few more spaced apart, and then no more, often well before menopause would have forced the issue. In *The Long Sexual Revolution: English Women, Sex, and Contraception 1800-1975*, Hera Cook quotes parson Charles Kingsley in an 1849 letter to his wife: ""I long to be back in your arms [all you my] cruel cold darling beauty [wish for is] to sleep by my side."" His wife, Fanny, had had one child in 1844, then a miscarriage in 1845, a second child in 1847, a third child in 1852, a miscarriage in 1853, and their last child in 1858, fitting into the pattern - it seems highly likely that she deliberately chose to turn down sex in order to prevent the later pregnancies from occurring as quickly as the first three. Other wives weren't so lucky, and had to resort to subterfuge to avoid their husbands' attempts to enforce their conjugal rights (which, in a time when it was understood that the marriage vows were effectively a blanket consent to sexual activity after the wedding, were seriously understood as *rights*): some women had to make excuses for avoiding their husbands instead, staying up late with housework or claiming that a child needed them to sleep in the other bedroom. 

So, paradoxically, the explanation of what married sex life was like ... is that it often wasn't really a sex life at all! Cook notes that oral and anal sex was highly stigmatized in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and so broadly suggests that abstinence really meant abstinence (or fairly infrequent sex), not alternatives to procreative sex, though by the 1930s there seems to have been a relatively large fraction of married couples that resorted to anal sex despite neither partner preferring it, as a form of birth control."
588,AskHistorians,"I’m a middle class Roman citizen planning to check out the Colosseum. How do I find the schedule? Do I bring friends or go alone? Should I eat before, or will they have food?","First of all, you would have to have a ticket! No entrance tickets to Colosseum survive, but we do have examples from elsewhere - a ticket would be a small token of wood, bone or lead, marked with the number of the block of the Colosseum, the level and finally the row number. We don't actually know how they were distributed: Beard and Hopkins suggest that perhaps you would get a ticket from your patron or - if you were a member of a club or a society, for instance, a funerary one or a priestly one - you could get it from there. 

A couple of caveats there: although the size of the building changed due to its unfortunate tehdency to burn down, by 354 AD our sources say that about 87 000 people could fit into the Colosseum. More plausible guesses put the number of spectators to about 50 000: even at average seat space of 40 cm (!) per person, it would be hard to cram in more people. This means that since the city of Rome at its height is usually said to have had more than one million inhabitants, it would be quite hard for you to get a spot in the amphiteatre.  We are also not quite clear whether the Colosseum was actually used every day: Carpoccino guesses that there were about 93 shows per year, while Beard and Hopkins point out that according to a fourth-century calendar, out of the 176 days devoted to 'holidays', just ten days were devoted to gladiatorial games. Hopkins, in general, is very skeptical of how often these took place and would suggest that perhaps for most of the year Colosseum was used (and I quote) 'as a place to flog your wares, take a nap, sight-see or make a pick-up': but note here three points. First, even if gladiatorial combat was rarer across the empire, Rome and the Colosseum was likely to be exceptional as the seat of the empire: second, not every occasion that took place in the Colosseum was gladiatorial combat, and we'll come back to that shortly - and finally, there was plenty of exceptional occasions that merited the use of the Colosseum, for instance during Trajan's celebratory year of 108-9, where it hosted performances almost one day out of five. Note that during its opening in 80 AD, the games were supposed to last a hundred days (!).

As for the schedule, most historians would agree that there was a fairly regular one: you would get morning animal hunts, midday executions (some of them being ingenious mythological recreations - for this, see Martial, De Spectaculis, who has some charming accounts of deadly reenactments of the myths of Prometheus or Orpheus), and then in the afternoon the gladiators. Beard and Hopkins importantly note that this was not a given and that we have stitched this program together from various references in ancient writers removed from each other by genre and time. Likely, the schedule depended as much as on this anticipation of a regular arrangement as on the element of surprise: 'the games must have been the same and different each time'. Early on, the Colosseum probably hosted a couple of naval battles, although evidence for this is disputed: Martial also harps on about this quite a bit, because it part of his larger theme of imperial power bending the limits of nature. As to the animal hunts, a certain professor once described them to us as 'David Attenborough, but they kill them all at the end', and I think that's a very eloquent way to sum it up, since these were displays as much as hunts. There were some notable exceptions to this short lifespan of the animals: there is a fun theory that there was a particular rhinoceros, who acquired something of a celebrity status during the reign of Titus and Domitian, since he is mentioned in Martial and commemorated on some coins of Domitian, but it is not as if we can prove that one way or the other. 

Maybe you have friends in your funerary society and they come along with you: it will be probably an entirely male affair, since the Augustan Lex Iulia Theatralis imposed some quite rigid laws on where everyone should sit in an amphitheater, which created and recreated a hierarchical paradigm of elements within the Roman society and how they relate to each other. Women were consequently consigned to the very back seats of the Colosseum, except for the Vestal Virgins: so either they did not go, since this was where the rabble sat, or - if they were elite women - they probably went and sat in the front anyway, since we have Ovid in Ars Amatoria commending gladiatorial presentations in the Forum (with temporary seating - not Colosseum!) as an ideal occasion for young men to meet and seduce women. Same applies for the slaves: officially, they could not sit in the front, but it is hard to imagine Roman aristocrats attending without some assistance, since - for instance - the canopies that were put up from the edges of the Colosseum to provide shade did not extend into the centre where they were, so they probably at least had someone holding a little parasol over them. You and your friends were therefore assigned certain seats within this paradigm, which mirrored your social situation and went to them orienting yourself by your ticket, which also included a number of the exit you needed to go through: the Colosseum had a quite complex system of crowd control, and all of them were numbered. It was a social event: Beard and Hopkins notes that the elite in the front seats would meet their friends there, chatting about alliances, marriages or promotions. You went there to see, but also to be seen. This was also the point of all the hierarchical seating since the Colosseum intentionally created something of a microcosm of the Roman society - any spectator was watching the show, but you would also keep an eye on other and on how they watched it. The emperor, in particular, was something people looked at - Suetonius frequently uses the way emperors watched the Games to make a point about what sort of people they were and how they related to the people, with Augustus watching attentively and even sending substitutes for when he could not attend, and Caligula storming out of the shows in rage.

As for your meal, you could do either. Emperors could and did on occasions provide food for the people in the Colosseum: Statius has Domitian distribute a banquet among the crowds in the Colosseum to celebrate the Saturnalia, with servants flooding in with baskets and some of the cakes and fruits even suspended above spectators by rope. We know people ate at Colosseum: there were fountains as far as the second floor, providing water, and people brought with them braziers to cook on. Archaeologists have found shells from clams, fruit pits as well as small bones of various animals that all indicate that people were happily snacking and eating within the Colosseum during the imperial period. 

For primary sources, key is Martial, De Spectaculis. Statius on Domitian's feast is in De Silvae, 1.6, and there is also a letter by Seneca (number 7) on lunchtime executions. Suetonius incidentally tells us quite a bit about games and the emperors, although you'll have to sift through it. Same goes for Cassius Dio and bits of Pliny. Note that we have to extrapolate a bit, as I did when using evidence from the Forum for the Colosseum: this is because we do not have that much evidence for the building itself.

For secondary sources, I highly recommend Keith Hopkins and Mary Beard, The Colosseum from 2005. A classic, although very dated, is Daily Life in Ancient Rome: The People and the City at the Height of the Empire by Jérôme Carcopino from 1936 - note it does not have the sort of archaeological underpinning we have today. For mythological executions, key is Kathleen M. Coleman,“Fatal Charades: Roman Executions Staged as Mythological Enactments”, in JRS 80 (1990). I also used Food and Drink in Antiquity: A Sourcebook, by  John F. Donahue (2015) and the permanent exhibition in the Colosseum itself."
589,AskHistorians,"When Lee surrendered his army to Grant at Appomattox, Grant allowed Lee's army of about 28,000 to disband and go home. How did 28,000 men from different towns leave a single area and where did they go?","""Homeward Bound"" by William Holberton is a great resource about this topic specifically. It deals exclusively with the demobilization of both Confederate and Union armies. I'll quote from it heavily in my response. I'm currently sitting on a plane in Seattle, typing this on my iPhone before I fly home to my family in Alaska, so please excuse any errors I make. 

I used to be flared in this sub-Reddit for the U.S. Civil War, so hopefully that buys me some ""thread credibility."" 

The disbanding of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia was all in all a peaceful process, considering how long the men fought for and how far away from home many of them were. While there were serious concerns about an insurrection after the surrender, R.E. Lee cut a strong figure to his men (as well as Lincoln's firm tone of reconciliation) that upon receiving his order to peacefully disband, Lee did just that. 

I know it might sound strange, but after the men were paroled by Grant and the Union Army they simply melted away into the forest and surrounding roads, towns and hamlets in small groups or on their own, making their way up to 1,500-2,000 miles home. Those who had to trek through the south were particularly hampered because of the thorough job General William Tecumseh Sherman had done in destroying the railroads in his legendary campaign. 

There were cases of small scale looting, but nothing so bad as the potential guerrilla warfare that many citizens feared might transpire after the official surrender of the Confederacy. 

One observer noted of the paroled men, ""As a rule they were tall, thin, spare men with long hair and a beard of a tawney red color. They were all clad in the uniform of Southern grey; nearly all were ragged and dirty...""

According to the terms of surrender, ""each body of soldiers was allowed to hold rifles equal to one-seventh of their numerical strength for protection and hunting along the way home."" There was talk of confiscating horses or mules from those who owned them, but once the idea of how to tend a farm in post-war life was brought up these men who were fortunate enough to own a beast of burden were allowed to keep them. 

An Englishman Francis Lowley observed the surrender at Appomattox and wrote, ""By the evening of the 12th paroles...were distributed, and the disbanded men began to scatter through the country. Hardly one of them had a farthing of money. Some of them had 1,500 to 2,000 miles to travel over a country of which the scanty railroads were utterly annihilated.""

What's important to remember about these men is that this was the dedicated core of what was left of Lee's once mighty Army. At this point, desertions had ticked up after Grant pushed Lee out of Richmond, and had his Union soldiers nipping at Lee's flanks and heels, like a pack of bloodhounds, as they fought predominantly rear guard engagements until reaching Appomattox. 

Point being is that this was one tough contingent of men who were used to fighting for their lives with scant, if any, supply lines. Now that these men were paroled and didn't have the pressure of fighting for their lives each day, it is easier to understand how these men were able to make their way back to their respective homes without having much else besides the clothes on their backs. 

The experiences for travelers differed greatly, depending on rank and distance to home. 

General Lee was given an armed escort for his journey, which wasn't very far since he travelled in Virginia. He was met cordially along the road by his former soldiers, many of them hooting and hollering the rebel yell one last time for their proud commander. It was reported one morning that Lee had an eventful breakfast of ""hard tack, fried pork and black coffee,"" the latter of which being quite rare during the war, as the Union blockade forced many confederate soldiers to find substitutes to traditional coffee, generals and privates alike. 

Yet the travels of some of the rank and file soldiers were much longer indeed. A sergeant from Texas, Valerius C. Giles, had been away for four years and five months. Slowly and ""painfully"" it took him three months to travel back to his home. 

But to me this quote sums it up best: ""A sad procession; some were halt and lame, and some with one arm or one eye. Yet these men, careworn and anxious-looking, and wounded as they may have been were on their way home, and nothing was going to prevent them, however long and circuitous, to that goal."" 

These men were alive. They'd seen their comrades die and their cause vanish. Yet they were still standing. The human spirit, not only in this conflict but in all conflicts around the world, is strong and those who are still breathing will find their way home after the last bullet has flown. And that's exactly what Lee's men did, no matter how long the journey. 

Ahh...it feels so good to be posting in this sub-Reddit again. "
590,AskHistorians,Why do English language speakers (Americans like myself) frequently use German to describe Germany during WWII?,"In most simple terms, it is an aesthetic choice that authors make, and you aren't entirely wrong in your observation. On the one hand it of course ought to be noted that it being a common convention, the usage simply self-perpetuates, with many authors likely not even thinking about *why* they chose to use *Luftwaffe* instead of German Air Force. Many, many decades of commonly refering to the *Wehrmacht* and *panzers* and *Kriegsmarine* kind of leads to a loss of any real thinking about the *why*. But still, I would stress that translation is inherently an editorializing act. The fact that the convention established itself *says something*, even if we don't think too much about it. The flipside of course is that because it is so common, choosing to translate to German Air Force, or German Navy, or just saying ""tank"" instead of ""panzer, stands out too and says something. And in fact it is something that some authors do more now, in no small part because of the issue you raise.

The best commentary on this trend comes from Richard J. Evans, who spent a little time in his Third Reich trilogy to explain why he chose *not* to follow this convention. Words such as *Führer* he renders merely as ""Leader"", and *Mein Kampf* shows up under the English title of ""My Struggle"". He is quite blunt in his reasons, which jive well with your own thoughts, as well as are ones I agree with (although I realize I unconsciously slip into the untranslated use frequently because, again, it is so common you just don't think about it), stating in the introduction to *Coming of the Third Reich* that ""*[r]etaining the German is a form of mystification, even romanticization, which ought to be avoided""*.

The exceptions he makes are very specific. He notes, generally, how the lack of specific English equivalents can impact translation, such as with the term *Volk*, where he notes:

>Some German words have no exact English equivalent, and I have chosen to be inconsistent in my translation, rendering national variously as 'national' or 'nationalist' (it has the flavour of both) and a similarly complex term, Volk, as 'people' or 'race, according to the context.

But in the case of *Reich* (and *Reichstag*), its ""particular, untranslateable resonances in German far beyond its English equivalent of ‘empire’"" made it impossible to translate without, as he noted, sounding ""artificial"". No one talks about ""The Third Empire"" or the ""Parliament Fire"". Similarly the term *Kaiser*, because, in his words, ""it, too, awakened specific and powerful historical memories."" But otherwise, he uses the English equivalents throughout the book. 

The romance that he notes, and you observed as well, is something which he aptly calls out, and it is impossible not to make connections in how we use those terms and 'otherize' the Nazi warmachine in a way that adds an unwarranted, and at times offensive, mystique around them. I'd go back to where I started though, ands again stress that translation isn't a neutral act. Even aside from the example of *Volk* highlighted, and how different translations need to be used at different times, it just, in a general sense, brings an approach that may be new and unfamiliar. Evans even notes that he expects his choices may be ""rather irritating"" for specialist readers, but (and maybe I read to much into it in thinking he is *throwing shade*) advises them to read ther German edition if this is the case for them. It being a general work, for English speakers, he is of the opinion (and rightly, in my own estimation), that his choices avoid the baggage that many bring in with those terms, and offers that new perspective in allowing ""readers to gain a feeling for what these things actually meant"".

So anyways, so sum this all up, there are different reasons we can say ""why"". There wasn't ever some convention of WWII historians where they agreed on what terms to use, and the ones that we do developed, and entrenched themselves, and become self-perpetating in their uncritical use and reuse, but they *do* carry with them baggage we can't ignore. They don't *explicitly* ""come from a place of fascination with the Nazis and their perceived military prowess"", as you put it, but they do play a *part* in it, less pure cause and effect though than intertwined dual-support. Many historians continue to use the terms untranslated, even if they perhaps recognize that to a degree, because the convention is *so* entrenched, and to many it would feel artificial to abandon at all, but others like Evans are more of the opinion that in recognizing that, we ought to be pushing to change the convention.

--------

ETA: One additional thing I would note. It is common to see talk of the *Wehrmacht* as the German Army, but that *actually* would be the *Heer*. The Wehrmacht was the armed forces as a whole. Something that I would note is that authors will often leave *Wehrmacht* untranslated, but even if they are using it properly, and then talk about the army separately, I can't think of any book which uses *Heer*. It usually is, basically, ""The Wehrmacht is made up of the *Army*, *Luftwaffe*, and *Kriegsmarine*"". This is its own interesting tangent. It speaks to two things, I believe. The first is that *Heer* just isn't an appealing word, and the second is that many people use *Wehrmacht* to mean German Army, incorrectly."
591,AskHistorians,"Italians were considered non-whites until 1945, did the KKK harass them ? If yes, did the Mafia ever fight back the KKK ?","So I wasn't planning on answering this yesterday but seeing as it remains unanswered, and in my poking around I found some top-notch stuff, I felt it has been sitting around long enough that I can answer it in good conscience even though I did mod in it yesterday (In the interest of transparency, my only involvement modding this thread was to remove [this comment](https://imgur.com/UqTmMbZ), which is very rules-breaking. Additionally, I have removed this and handed over approval to another mod).

To start off, I'd give a nod to /u/FoucaultMeMichel's comment to a follow-up question [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9l4uus/italians_were_considered_nonwhites_until_1945_did/e74oz9d/) which addresses part of the premise, namely the idea of Italians and ""Whiteness"", which wasn't quite a dichotomy that flipped in 1945, but rather a process that slowly took place from the late 19th through the mid-20th century. So by the 1920s, at the height of the Second KKK, ""whiteness"" and what it meant was a factor in how members of the Italian-American community were viewed by the Klan, but it was only one of several. 

The first Klan, of the immediate post-Civil War period, can be (if in a rush) understood in very stark racial terms, but the second had broader concerns, advocating an idea that native-born, white Protestants were the only proper American. They were anti-Immigrant and anti-Catholic, both of which were strong marks against the those of Italian extraction. The Klan demanded an American community that was, to borrow from Pegram, ""normative"". In this vision of America there was no room for hyphenated identities. You couldn't be an Italian-American, nor a Catholic-American. To be sure, racial ideas of the superiority of Anglo-Saxon heritage also played an important part here. *Legally* speaking White included Europeans of Slavic or Mediterranean extraction, who were admitted to the country as white persons by laws that banned or limited non-whites, but that doesn't mean that they were accepted as equals by those of a nativity mindset, well exemplified by the Klan. Racial stereotypes about various groups' dictated views, as did circumstance too, as poor, recent immigrants often had to do menial, backbreaking labor that for many was the job only of their racial inferiors, which also helped to feed ideas of them being 'non-white'.

So the point here is that you have several overlapping factors, all of which helped feed this idea of 'otherness' for ethnic Italians, which in the end can really come down to their desire to maintain some sense of their ethnic identity while *still* trying to also see themselves as American at the same time, an idea which the Klan abhorred and believed contradictory. Targeted communities responded in different ways, some pushing back while others feeling pressure to be more vocal in their Americanism. Anti-Catholic rhetoric often (but not always) pushed previously separate ethnic communities that were nevertheless united by religious ties to bond over their Catholicism and fight back together. This could at times take the form of violence, such as in Marienette, WI where French, German, Irish, and Polish Catholics - all who attended different parishes - joined together to shut down a Klan meeting after it was learned that a KKK speaker had insulted a priest. Klan rhetoric also could help unite simply on ethnic persecutions too, at times seeing alliances between African-Americans, Jews, and the various Catholic communities. In the end, while it doesn't make it right by any means, it can be said that Klan rhetoric helped, at least in part, to actually develop a better sense of pluralist Americanism, by forcing the various disunited groups they had targeted to seek out each other and work together to craft a more vocal and open idea of being both themselves and American.

*But*, this is all general 'fighting back' and you are interested in something a little more specific obviously. The short answer is that having scanned through every book I have on the Klan (See sources below), I was unable to find anything that suggested a serious effort by the Mafia to combat the KKK either physically or via rhetoric, although ironically, a belief that all Italians were in the mafia (i.e. criminal lowlifes) helped fuel ethnic hatreds within the KKK. I can't say this was unexpected, but I am sorry to report it. However, I can at least offer you the runner up prize and touch specifically physical resistance to the Klan within the Italian-American and larger Catholic-American community, both by individuals, and also fraternal groups such as the Knights of Columbus, and the smaller Knights of the Flaming Circle, so that is kind of the next best thing, right?

There were all manner of ways that these groups sought to disrupt and fight back against the Klan. Many young men would engage in all sorts of heckling and sabotage, such as scattering tacks on the road the night before a Klan rally so as to puncture the car tires, all the way up through nighttime bombings of Klan-affiliated printing presses. When the KKK showed up at South Bend, Indiana in 1924 to demonstrate on the grounds of (Catholic) University of Notre Dame, an all-out melee broke out when, rather then sit by passively - an organizer had remarked in advance that ""*if some of those priests come out it will be up to us to hit him [sic] in the nose.*” - students swarmed the marchers and send them scurrying. 

One particularly notable example of this resistance was the Knights of the Flaming Circle, a group formed to be an anti-Klan organization, with their own secret rituals and symbolism, and created by young men who believed that the Knights of Columbus was too stuffy and not willing to endorse *real* (ie violent) solutions. A Catholic organization drawing from the Italian and Irish community, it formed in 1923 as a reaction to a riot in Steubenville, Ohio. Originating in the Mahoning Valley of the state, it was founded by dentist and ""Grand Supreme Monarch"" W.S. McGuigan. The Flaming Circle was a tongue-in-cheek mimicry of the Klan, taking their name from the act of burning a tire in public which they did to mock the Klan's cross-burning, but also a deadly serious group, willing and seeking to pick fights and do their best to ensure the KKK regretted showing up. They sought both to protect their neighborhoods from Klan interference, as well as to disrupt Klan activities, and generally signal they wouldn't be cowed. When a cross was burned in front of a church, they would respond by burning tires in front of the houses of those suspected to have Klan ties. Many Klan rallies in the mid-20s would be met by mobs from these and similar groups, often armed and ready for a fight.

And more importantly, *it worked*. It became harder for the Klan to portray itself as an innocuous, civic-minded organization when their rallies kept turning into violent affrays, and in turn the result was the loss of many members who were less than wholly committed, or otherwise unwilling to put actually deal with such incidents. The Klan may have trumpeted a militant rhetoric, but not all walked-the-walk, and when faced with opponents willing to take them at their word, many couldn't stand to. Splits within the organization even came about from this, with comparative moderates who tempered their rhetoric in reaction to such push-back going one way, while the true militants going the other, often to be met with the same results, such as planned marchers in Niles, Ohio, where one of the most violent reactions to the Klan occurred.  

The march there had been billed as a major one, timed to the November elections and intended to be a demonstration against Catholic influence in the schools. The mayor and police chief were seen as Klan lackeys, and in the opening salvo from the Knights of the Flaming Circle, their houses were bombed. Roadblocks were erected to prevent Klansmen from entering the town, resulting in exchanges of gunfire. The mayor deputized several Klansmen which did little to stop the violence, and the National Guard had to be called in. In the end, the march never actually happened, and was an abject disaster for the Klan who had hoped to portray themselves as for law and order. Many Klansmen simply quit, and in Niles, at least, it was mostly done in. Other chapters of the Flaming Circle, which was mostly focused in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, similarly used armed demonstrations against the Klan, but never with quite the same level of violence.

So in sum, yes, Italian-Americans were a target of the KKK, on several different grounds, including their general status as an immigrant community, their ethnic origins, and their religion. They were hardly alone in this though, and often found compatriots in other immigrant, ethnic, and/or non-Protestant communities that were similarly targeted by the KKK, and fought back both together and separately. While your pondering over involvement of the Mafia makes for what would maybe make for a great old-school B-film, there seems to be no evidence of Mafia involvement institutionally, even if individuals with Mafia ties may have participated. There were however fraternal groups that *did* fight back. The Knights of Columbus were a public advocate against the Klan, while smaller, more shadowy groups like the Irish-Italian Knights of the Flaming Circle attempted to beat the Klan at their own ""secret society"" game. In some ways these groups were similar to the Mafia, even, which was a 'protection organization' after all, although rather then acting by extorting the community they claimed to protect, the Flaming Circle and its ilk were driven by a real desire to defend their community, and live the American Dream."
592,AskHistorians,"Switzerland had an impressive military history up until the early 16th century, at which point they adopted their famous neutrality. What caused them to adopt this stance, and how have they been able to maintain it through 500 years of European wars?","So, the ""500 years of Swiss neutrality"" has been disputed as a historical myth invented in the 19th century, a sort of ""invented tradition"".

In his 1983 essay volume edited together with Terence Ranger, Eric Hobsbawm describes that a lot of traditions we today associate with being old, handed down for generations etc. are invented, mostly in the service of nationalism in the 19th century and only claim to be much older than that. As they remark, ""modern nations and all their impedimenta generally claim to be the opposite of novel, namely rooted in remotest antiquity, and the opposite of constructed, namely human communities so 'natural' as to require no definition other than self-assertion."" and that also applies to many a symbol or practice associated with that new nation and national sentiment. From supposedly ancient Scottish clan tartans that were introduced in the 19th century to the martial arts of Japan, the nationalist movement lies at the base for a lot of these supposedly ancient traditions and symbols.

This also applies to the idea of Swiss neutrality since the 16th century since that narrative was created in the 19th century under specific historical circumstances to which I'll get in a minute.

To start off with the traditional narrative: It is generally held that the old Swiss Confederacy (Eidgenossenschaft) adopted neutrality after the battle of Marignano in Lombardy when Swiss mercenaries fought against France in the battle for rule over Northern Italy and suffered a terrible defeat where the Swiss mercenaries suffered between 8000 and 10000 casualties. The exact politics behind the battle are complicated and not exactly my expertise but what is important is that the troops of the Swiss confederacy fought against the French who desired control over Northern Italy. The battle had far reaching consequences: It ended all expansionist politics of the old Swiss Confederacy, showed that mercenaries were not the best way to fight wars anymore and forced the Confederacy to sign a peace treaty with France that put the Swiss Confederacy under the cultural and political influence of France. Within the Confederacy it ended a period of communal foreign policy that had been difficult to maintain even beforehand, mainly because of the religious split of the various cantons.

When Marignano is cited today the prevailing narrative behind it is that the defeat was so terrible that from it grew the policy of Swiss Neutrality that was maintained basically until up to today. But that narrative has actually little basis. The way it came about shows the intentions behind it:

Modern Swiss Neutrality has its origins in the Vienna Congress of 1815 when the European powers after having defeated Napoleon agreed that it was sensible to have a neutral Switzerland in their midst. France and Austria originally planned for Switzerland to become a satellite state while Prussia wanted to integrate it in the German Bund. Because there were so many plans and so many competing interests, these powers ultimately agreed for Switzerland to remain neutral and thus the modern legal concept of state neutrality was born.

As most of the people familiar with Switzerland know, it is a rather hands off state and was especially so during the 19th century. In the latter half of that century, it also became a safe haven for people forced to flee other European countries because of their political views (probably the most famous example being Lenin). Now when Bismarck in Germany passed his famous ""Socialist Laws"". which outlawed socialist, communist and social democratic political activity, many German socialists and communists fled to Switzerland in order to escape persecution.

Because Switzerland did not invest too much in police observing these socialists as well as other left-wingers from Russia and France, various European powers started to send spies in order to keep tabs on the various left-wing politicians and activists. One of these spies, a German named August Wohlgemuth was arrested in the Canton Aargau in 1889 and charged with espionage. This lead to an open political conflict with Bismarck. He demanded the release of Wohlgemuth and rallied his allies behind him. Germany, Russia, and Austria send diplomatic notes to Bern threatening to nullify the statue of Swiss neutrality from 1815 should Switzerland refuse to keep tabs on the political exiles in accordance with their demands. The gist was: Neutrality was a gift from the European powers and as such it could rescinded whenever they wished.

This did not go down well in Switzerland. Enter Paul Schweizer, state archivist of Zürich and historian. Publishing a nine part series in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) in 1889 – which would later become the core of his monumental monography on the subject of Swiss neutraltiy – he started out to oppose the idea that Swiss neutrality was something bestowed upon the Swiss by the European powers but rather something that had a massive deal of history behind it. Because he had virtually no legal argument at his hands, he advanced a historical one that was build upon the idea of imbuing Swiss neutrality with legitimacy independent of  the European powers because of its long and storied (and in many ways not really well-founded) history. As Andreas Suter argued, the idea that Switzerland in the early modern period was a neutral country was ""at its core a response to a monumental foreign policy crisis and a threat by the European powers"".

Following Schweizer's publication and his monograph, the idea of Marignano being the origin of Swiss neutrality that had since been strictly maintained took hold and until this day plays a central role in Swiss political discourse.

However, historiography has long contested the myth of Marignano and neutrality. Emil Usteri in his book *Marignano. Die Schicksalsjahre 1515/1516 im Blickfeld der historischen Quellen.* was the first one to call the narrative into question by re-examining the historical sources following the battle and finding no evidence of a decision to become neutral. In recent years Andreas Suter, Swiss historian at the German university of Bielefeld, has published a lot concerning this question providing further prove that the idea of 500 years of Swiss neutrality is an invented tradition of the late 19th century.

593,AskHistorians,"Why is it that Muslims are opposed to the depiction of Muhammad but many name their children Muhammad, whereas many Christians are opposed to naming their children Jesus but like depictions of Jesus?","Well, I think I can answer the first half of your question, though I don't know enough to answer the second half beyond the vague familiarity with questions about iconography and iconoclasm that comes with a Catholic upbringing and one year at a Jesuit university, so I think I'll leave that aside and stick to the Islamic half of your question.

Ok, with that being said, let's break this down into constituent parts.

Firstly, I want to answer something that you didn't ask, but is good for background:

1. Why was Muhammad named ""Muhammad"", what does that name mean and how do Arabic names work?

We might actually go back even further and ask an interesting side question of why Muhammad was named Muhammad. Etymologically in Arabic the name ""Muhammad"" means sort of 'one who is praised' or 'one who is praiseworthy'. In pre-Islamic Arabia it seems to have been a highly unusual name for males. My understanding is that all of the surviving examples of other men with the name Muhammad in pre-Islamic Arabia were also holy men. The female version ""Muhammada"" seems to have been much more common. This has even produced some (albeit fringe) speculation that Muhammad might have been an appellation rather than a name as such. I don't buy that, nor is it necessary to.

Etymologically it's also worth noting that as Arabic is a semitic language it works on tri-letter roots, in this case H-M-D, and therefore the name Muhammad is etymologically related and similar in meaning to names like Ahmed, Hamid and Mahmoud.

Also, ""Muhammad"" would not have been Muhammad's only personal name. Arabic names can also include what is known as a Kunya. Most commonly this takes the form of ""Father of X"" with X being your oldest male child. But it can also be an epithet. The first caliph Abu Bakr's name literally means ""Father of Camel Foal,"" but it just means that he spent a lot of time riding camels and had a family that was engaged in herding. Muhammad's kunya was Abu al-Qassim, the father of Qassim, who was his son who died in early childhood.

Arabic names also typically include a patronymic or nasab (ibn Fulan...son of so-and-so). This can string along for as long as is necessary back to whichever ancestor is most relevant for tribal or other purposes. It can also skip generations to get to a more uniquely identifying individual. I'm less familiar with pre-Islamic naming practices but it's also worth mentioning laqabs, which today are often translated as simply surnames but in a pre-modern context could include nickname-like titles, particular for important individuals and rulers, as well as nisbas, which today are likewise often a last name but could also refer to a tribe or place of origin. 

I'll come back to this later (and I'm sure one of our native Arabic speakers here will correct me if I've mis-identified part of this) but to take the example of a well-known medieval religious scholar you might have a name like: **Aḥmad** (Ism, or name) **bin Muḥammad** (nasab) **bin Ḥanbal** (nasab) **Abū ʿAbd Allāh** (kunya, i.e. Ahmad's son is named Abdullah) **al-Shaybānī** (tribal nisba, indicating descent from the [Banu Shayban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Shayban)).

--------

Phew, ok, with that background moving into your questions. I'll start with the easier one first:

2 . Why do Muslims name their male children Muhammad?

There's potentially a very long explanation of getting into how exactly these practices developed and whether this was universally true at all times and particularly in the earliest years of Islam, but to cut a long story short, the practice of Islam is based on carrying out God's commandments. Etymologically ""Islam"" means submission to God or to God's will as delivered through the message of his Prophet, the seal of the prophets (i.e. the last and most perfect prophet), Muhammad.

In Islam, the Qur'an is the perfect record of God's speech and revelation to mankind. But very early, in all likelihood during Muhammad's lifetime, it became assumed or presumed that in the absence of a Qur'anic message or commandment, it is best to follow the example of the Prophet in all things, down to the most minute details. Together the collected records of this side of Muhammad's personal life is known as the ""sunna"" and is recorded in the Hadith, and gives its name to ""Sunni"" Islam. NB that Shia Muslims also follow the prophetic example but also believe in following the examples of Ali and his descendants (who are also Muhammad's descendants, as he married Muhammad's daughter, and was incidentally his ~~nephew~~ [edit: h/t /u/asoomdeys ] cousin to begin with).

In any event, included among these hadith are statements by Muhammad suggesting that Muslims name themselves and their children after himself: https://sunnah.com/search/?q=use+my+name

""Name yourself...?"" you may be asking. Well, one of the traditions in Islam is to take on an Islamic/Arabic name when you convert. It's not 100% guaranteed universal, but was very common.

Also note that Muhammad forbade the use of his Kunya, Abu al-Qassim. Like all religious strictures of course, this one has been broken historically: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_al-Qasim

3 . Why is it that Muslims are opposed to the depiction of Muhammad?

This is slightly more complicated, at least historically or when discussing historical practices. The contemporary sort of Salafist or ultra-orthodox answer is very simple, which is that images of human beings generally are potentially idolatrous. In practice this can be somewhat bi-polar: the Arab Persian Gulf states plaster the faces of their rulers on practically every building, but only put gazelles and coffee-pots on their coinage.

In any event, the concern with images of Muhammad in particular is multifaceted. There is concern that the image of Muhammad is perhaps uniquely susceptible to idolatry and he must therefore, in particular not be depicted. Insofar as it is taken as being commanded against in the religion, depictions of Muhammad are therefore also ipso facto blasphemy. And lastly there is concern that in the case of cartoons or depictions of Muhammad drawn by non-Muslims that these are an assault on the honor of Muhammad (who, as we've discussed, is basically regarded as a perfect human being) and on the religion of Islam itself. It's therefore an incredibly emotive issue.

The more complicated answer would be how that came to be and whether it was always so as /u/FlamingBlankets and /u/Newtothisredditbiz allude to. This is a historiographically complex and deeply debated question, which to my knowledge largely focuses on two distinct periods in Islamic history.

The first is earliest Islamic period. Representational art was not really a feature of pre-Islamic Arabic culture. After the conquest period Muslims apparently adopted representational art quite readily. So you have the frescoes in the [Umayyad desert palaces](https://www.google.ae/search?q=frescoes+umayyad&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQsqSEw8HQAhUKrY8KHXcKCd4Q_AUICCgB&biw=1680&bih=871) or the so-called ""standing caliph"" coins: https://www.google.ae/search?q=standing+caliph+coins&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwil7bCcw8HQAhUKKY8KHQ0EAWYQ_AUICCgB&biw=1680&bih=871

There are lots of questions about this. Were these simply accommodation to pre-existing Greco-Roman and Zoroastrian culture? After all, these coins were clearly modeled on existing Byzantine coinage. Or did something about the depiction of humans in Islamic ideology change fundamentally under Abd al-Malik in the late 7th/early 8th century such that he adopted (or perhaps invented?) the more distinctly ""Islamic"" coinage style: https://attwiw.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/abd-al-malik-coin.jpg (And, indeed, did so in art and architecture as well, as in the construction of the Dome of the Rock.)

To bring this back to Muhammad, in particular, this is complicated by theories that the ""standing caliph"" in those coins might actually be Muhammad himself. This is unresolved, but there are plausible reasons for thinking that it might be.

I'm rapidly running out of space here, but suffice it to say by the end of the reign of Abd al-Malik, Islamic artistic and religious norm was distinctly an-iconic, and there are some really interesting essays and discussions about the interplay and dialogue between Islamic and Byzantine iconoclasm from this period.

The second period, which I'm far less familiar with, relates to the ""Persian Miniature"" tradition (which was also practiced by the Ottomans and Mughals.) I'm far less familiar with the historiography or debates around these images of Muhammad or why they subsequently went out of fashion and so I'll withhold comment.

-------------

Interesting addenda:

One of the features of the above that I find to be interesting is that there are actually far more Muhammad's in the world than many people may realize. Because it is traditional to name sons Muhammad, that obviously isn't an especially useful name to have for identification purposes-- like being named John Smith only much more so. The result in countries like Egypt is that it's very common for men to be named Muhammad but then go by a second name. So to give some well known examples: Anwar Sadat was actually Muhammad Anwar Sadat. Hosni Mubarak is actually Muhammad Hosni Mubarak. The ""Yasser"" in Yasser Arafat is actually an adopted name but he was actually Muhammad Arafat. Etc.

594,AskHistorians,Farmers were major supporters of socialism and progressive populism in the early 20th century. Why isn't that the case anymore?,"Put simply, the salience of cultural issues. Cultural issues were not an issue for farmers then the way they are today.

Before getting into that, we have to clarify three terms which your question runs together. Progressivism, socialism, and populism were very different and had different roots and political bases. Today, they sometimes get lumped together as being generally on the political left, but this obscures important differences that must be understood to answer your question.

The Populist or People's Party was organized around the economic distress of rural farmers who felt exploited by railroads, banks, and a political system more concerned to protect the explosively growing industrial economy than the relatively sleepy agricultural sector. Populists originated much of the language used today to rail against wealthy special interests with corrupt influence over politicians. 

For them, these interests weren't primarily the rich so much as railroads, which would exploit their natural monopoly on local transport to extort farmers to bring their produce to market, and Eastern bankers, whose policies, such as the gold standard, made it hard for farmers to get credit (which they needed to buy seed to plant every season). The populists wanted the government to regulate or seize ownership of the railroads and wanted to break the centralized control of the financial system to free up credit, such as through bimetallism. They were also in favor of political reforms such as the direct election of Senators because they wanted to make representatives more accountable to the people.

When you say that farmers supported ""socialism and progressive populism,"" what that really meant was, in the first place, populism. Of the three movements, populism gained a mass following first (peaking in the 1890s), and would serve as the seedbed for farmer political activity through the New Deal. Though the political mobilization behind a left agenda that this original movement sparked explains some farmers later supported the Progressives and Socialists, these latter movements also had very different political bases and aims. 

The Progressivism was in the main a middle class movement. It aimed, above all, at the reform of government by purging it of corruption and making it more directly accountable to the people, as well as more professional and scientific. It also sought to regulate capitalism, but not to abolish it. The issue of reform linked the populists and the Progressives, but the Progressives were much more concerned with urban governance and industrial issues like safety and sanitation than were rural farmers. 

The Socialists had their main support in urban centers, among the industrial working class. There were substantial efforts at cross-worker solidarity, between farmers and industrial workers, but these never entirely coalesced. The attraction of socialism to farmers is not hard to grasp; the populists' desire for government ownership of railroads and other agricultural services, among other farmer-supportive policies, were entirely consistent with socialist ideology. Scared of big government, farmers were not. But farmers were less invested in some of the socialist movement's central efforts, which were oriented toward confrontations with capitalist factory owners in strikes and efforts at collective bargaining. 

Farmers were a mainstay of FDR's New Deal, which included massive government action to support farmers financially and to improve agricultural infrastructure, in the spirit of, if not entirely along the lines advocated by, the Populist Party. 

So when did this all change? Like so much of American politics, in the 1960s, with the Civil Rights movement. The Civil Rights movement kicked off what political scientists call a realignment of the parties and their coalitions. The reason is that the Democratic Party became the party of civil rights for black Americans. Before this time, a lot of farmers were Democrats, as part of the New Deal coalition, and a lot of these farmers were Southerners. The national party's backing of civil rights alienated many white Southerners, including farmers. Race, which had always been important but usually not in determining *elections*, became electorally explosive. Where people stood on race would come to be an important part of where you stood, and who you stood with, in politics overall. This is the origin of what we today often euphemistically call ""cultural issues."" 

In the years following civil rights, a new politics would emerge, midwifed by people like Nixon and Reagan, which divided Americans along cultural lines. Were you on the side of the forces that were upsetting traditional American life? The dope-smoking, free-love hippies? The frightening and ungrateful Black Panthers? The student radicals disrespecting the troops and the flag? Did you support black advancement, even if it meant affirmative action? Did you support women's liberation? New sexual mores? Divorce? Abortion? All these new ""cultural"" questions served to displace the economic dimension of political competition which had defined the Populist era. Now, farmers found themselves on the opposite side of these questions from those who supported left policies. 

And that brings us to today. Farmers are today a very small group, but they are generally heavily rural, and rural Americans are culturally identified with the party that opposes most of the things the Populist, Progressive, and Socialist parties stood for. This identification was the outcome of the civil rights realignment, which raised the salience of race as an issue and made possible its exploitation to divide Americans along cultural lines.

595,AskHistorians,"Currently in the U.S., poor whites predominantly live in rural areas and poor blacks and poor Latinos predominantly live in inner cities. What historical factors and events led to this being the case? Has it always been this way?","OK, so this is going to be a complicated one, but just to start, I'm going to push back on your idea that poor whites predominantly live in rural areas, and poor minorities live in inner cities.  This was true a few decades ago, but [it's not true today](https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/the-changing-geography-of-us-poverty/).  In raw numbers, *suburban* poverty is the most common form of poverty in America today.  (This violates the 20-year rule, but it's necessary to clear up the misconception.)

Anyhow.  Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'm going to speak to urban poverty and how it became synonymous with minorities.

**1900-1948: racist property deeds and redlining**

The first part concerns a rather bad part of American law which has now, thankfully, been abolished: the racial covenant.  When you buy a piece of property, you agree to certain restrictions in the real estate deed.  Starting in the early 20th century, it was extremely common for real estate deeds to contain racial restrictions on who could own the property.  Most commonly, [this was used to keep blacks out of white neighborhoods,](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Racial_deed_restriction.gif)  but could be used to keep other ""undesirables"" out, depending on who the targeted minority of the moment was - on the West Coast it was common to exclude Jews, Hispanics and Asians as well as blacks.  These racial covenants were invalidated by the court decision *Shelley v. Kraemer* in 1948.

But racist policy concentrating poor minorities in specific urban neighborhoods wasn't just limited to racial covenants, either.  The Federal Housing Administration actually refused to finance mortgages in minority neighborhoods, a practice called *redlining*.  If you want to check out what one of these maps looks like, here's [one of Los Angeles from 1939](https://www.kcet.org/sites/kl/files/thumbnails/image/losangelesholc-med.jpg).  That big block of red to the east of Downtown LA?  That's Boyle Heights, which was filled with Mexicans, Jews and Asians.  The other big block of red directly to the south of Downtown L.A.?  That's South Central Los Angeles, which was the hub of L.A.'s black community.  The federal government flatly refused to invest in these neighborhoods, leading to their decline.  And when the FHA helped finance new suburban housing developments, they deliberately segregated them by requiring racial covenants in the '30s and '40s, and in some cases as late as the 1960s.

**1948-2000: freeways and deliberate housing shortages**

After the Second World War, there was a truly massive housing shortage due to the underbuilding in the Great Depression and the lack of new home construction during the war years.  So, the federal government stepped in, and did two things that concentrated poor minorities in the decaying inner city.

First, the federal government invested truly enormous sums into building freeway networks.  And new freeways were deliberately routed through minority neighborhoods - Black Bottom in Detroit, Boyle Heights in Los Angeles, the South Bronx in New York City - so white, suburban commuters could drive downtown.  Because no one wants to live next to a freeway, and the federal government wasn't investing in those neighborhoods, those who could leave, did - and the white residents decamped en masse for the newly-built, lily-white suburbs, which where also financed by the FHA.  Conveniently, these new freeways also made it much, much easier for suburban commuters to get downtown, bypassing all the older city neighborhoods in-between.  Minorities and the poor, without the money to leave, ended up in the older city neighborhoods, which is how you get ""the inner city"" stereotypes.

Second, starting in the late 1960s, wealthy, white neighborhoods - especially in rich, liberal areas - just decided to stop building new housing altogether, rather than to allow apartments to be built.  (Apartments, it was thought, were for poor people, minorities, and poor minorities.)  Rich places like Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Berkeley, and Scarsdale all just decided to stop building new housing altogether, effectively pricing out minorities and the poor.  Despite being in incredibly desirable parts of the country, the population in many of these rich, white places has remained stagnant - or in some cases, has shrunk - since 1970.  

City | 1970 pop. | 2019 pop.
---|---|----
Beverly Hills, CA | 33,416 | 33,792
Santa Monica, CA | 88,289 | 90,401
Berkeley, CA | 114,091 | 121,363
Piedmont, CA  | 10,917 | 11,135
Nassau County, NY | 1,428,080 | 1,356,924
Scarsdale, NY | 19,229 | 17,871

**2000-present: why the stereotype of urban poverty is no longer true**

But this has changed in the last twenty years or so, as most cities have generally stabilized, and now it's the older  suburbs that have started to age.  The oldest post-war suburbs have begun to decline, as the infrastructure and housing stock are nearing seventy years old.

In some places, like LA and NYC, the massive housing shortage caused by the refusal to build more housing in rich neighborhoods has meant that property prices remain high and a ton of city gentrification has happened, even in ""inner city"" neighborhoods that rich whites never would have gone in 1980 or 1990.  These are places like Bedford-Stuyvesant in NYC (home of Notorious B.I.G.), and Crenshaw, Los Angeles (home of Ice-T), where a house can easily run you $1,000,000 these days.  And as this gentrification has happened, the poor end up getting priced out, and move to older, outer-ring suburbs like San Bernardino, CA or Bridgeport, CT.

The canonical book on the subject, by the way, is Rothstein's *The Color of Law*, which I highly recommend."
596,AskHistorians,"Realistically most ships between the 1600s and 1700s carried cargo mostly not gold, so what did pirates do with all those random assortments of wheat, cotton, tea, and stamps?","There were black market merchants, smugglers, counterfeiters, and launderers of goods that they could sell it to. Smuggling probably being the largest one. Not every port was secured or had a harbormaster who cared (bribed) enough against pirates sailing in to sell their goods. If it was, pirates could offload their goods ship to ship or at a beach site, to a more legitimate seeming ship or a smuggler. For goods that did not have any system in place to verify their source, they could simply be sold to any seedy merchant. For goods and ports that were controlled, a more sophisticated system would be needed. The process being sort of similar to modern day money laundering or cigarette smuggling. Pirates takes possession of the goods, then they must get it in condition it can enter the legal market or find a black market buyer. This was usually done by a 3rd party counterfeiter, forger, or merchant. The goal being either to a final consumer who was willing to accept it as black market, or to make it appear legitimate for a consumer who only wants a legitimate good. Piracy was only a small part of the capture/transportation of illegal goods. Many illegal goods began legitimate or were stolen, and became illegal simply because they were smuggled to avoid taxes and duties (or in some cases, only a select few had the rights/privileges of trade).

The respective nations were not incompetent and enacted a plethora of measures to combat both piracy and the trade of illicit/pirated goods. Even in days before electronic monitoring, UPC codes, etc, a lot of goods required stamps, marks, and certification from both goods and merchant. Some measures were somewhat counterproductive, like Spain's mercantilism policies which meant the colonies could only trade with Madrid. This created a black market demand for other European goods. 

For some periods there were some less than lawful ports like Nassau and Tortuga which served as pirate havens and markets for illegal goods. More ports fell into a more grey area, where most was legitimate, but some illegal goods were traded. Many more towns and ports were known for smuggling than outright piracy. Cawsand, England was one of them. As time went on and the bureaucracy expanded and the nations and companies had more resources and funds at their disposal they were able to chase pirates out through force and inventory controls. 

The actual process of smuggling, mercantilism, and the combating illegal goods would be a large response to questions on their own.

597,AskHistorians,"Did Southern girls around the Civil War really take naps en masse in the middle of a party, as depicted in Gone With the Wind?","Disclaimer (edited): most of what I'm talking about here is from the perspective of higher society white culture in the North and South. There were some differences in the antebellum South, but little that impacts this specific question because as you'll see if you read the full text it tl;dr, I very strongly suspect the subject is apocryphal* (edit). White plantation ladies hosted parties, entertained their peers, lessers, and leaders, and maintained appearances at all cost.

I have several books and magazines from the era that go into excruciating detail on what to do and not do at parties and I can find no mention of this whatsoever. I've checked my etiquette books from that era and after ([here](https://i.imgur.com/lr6dRI8.jpg) are two [examples](https://imgur.com/KqBkv9S) of later era books I checked, because often etiquette books will recommend *stopping* a practice like that if it's been going on, but no dice), plus a plethora of magazines for anecdotes, stories, etc. I have several years' worth of [Harper's](https://imgur.com/mio3OET) and Chautauqua Society magazines, which have lots of slice-of-life articles and social commentary. Nothing.

I *suspect* this is apocryphal for a few reasons. One, etiquette of the period was more rigid, yes, but more importantly ladies were expected to be social and maintain a level of decorum. For a tiny taste of what I mean, [here's a sample from one of my etiquette books covering general etiquette](https://imgur.com/hS2WwCa). (Sorry about the terrible quality.) Everything was about making others feel at ease, and indeed, that's the theme in every single book and article of the time. Don't be selfish. There's a famous (and possibly apocryphal) story from the era of a society lady who was choking at a dinner party and, rather than embarrass her host, went into the toilet and quietly died. Very Victorian. Mass lady naps during a party just sounds selfish and anti-Victorian. What if a guest wasn't tired? Shall the hostess sleep while her guest stares at the wallpaper? That's a horrifying concept in 1860.

Point two, why? It wasn't the corsets, I can promise you that, especially pre-1880. White women of any means weren't binding themselves into oblivion that early. The corset was a supportive foundation garment and when properly fitted was not uncomfortable or restrictive at all. And keep in mind that they'd been wearing them their entire lives so they were quite used to it. Corsetry had been an established industry for at least a century and even a woman of modest means could afford a decent one; a well-off socialite could choose from the best silk and spiral steel numbers on offer. Even when they did get a bit silly and wasp-waisted in the height of the bustle-era, regular ladies weren't torturing themselves en masse. Well, no more than people do with plastic surgery and extreme body modification today. Those were the elite, the Kardashians. People like me could breathe fine. Speaking of me, here's how I know this: [this is me in a reproduction 1880s French seam corset](https://imgur.com/eDrMZ8z) that I made using authentic period techniques. I've been making and wearing them for 20+ years. It's very comfortable, I can breathe fine, touch my toes, and everything. It's boned with steel. [Here's a new one I'm working on.](https://imgur.com/u8m4e7b) I've been researching and speaking on this topic for decades, but there's also a well-researched [How Stuff Works article](http://people.howstuffworks.com/corset.htm) that's worth a read if you're interested.

That said, is it possible that, in the sweltering heat of the Deep South, some groups of friends or some families may have done this as a habit? Sure. Maybe Margaret Mitchell's own family had this tradition and she extrapolated it to everyone. I just personally doubt it was an institution throughout the southern states. If it were, I'm shocked I can't find a single mention of it outside one work of historical fiction. Edit: I also perused online articles and Google Books.

Is absence of evidence evidence of absence? Maybe not, but I've got about a thousand sentences telling women not to hum in public and far more on the various uses of vibrators to cure hysteria (and they weren't supposed to talk about that). I've also got actual Victorian pornography, which isn't supposed to exist. But I can't find this.

Tl;dr: I've been pretty immersed in this era for a long time and I've never seen a single mention of this outside one work of historical fiction, plus I can't think of a supporting reason for it to be true.

598,AskHistorians,"Upon discovering the concentration camp near Gotha General Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote: ""I felt that the evidence should be immediately placed before the American and British publics"" Did any other allied generals make a systemic attempt at documenting the holocaust?","**Part 1**

So, to answer this as best as possible, there is a bit of context necessary, especially in that both the Allied leadership and the public in Allied countries had been aware of the Holocaust occurring while it was going on and had already started to collect evidence, mainly for the purpose of trials already during the war.

[In this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6696bw/new_understanding_of_allies_knowledge_of_the/) I go into detail concerning Allied knowledge of the Holocaust but in summary, it is imperative to know that Allied government had been aware of the Einsatzgruppen shooting as soon as it started via decrypted documents, had already seen other decrypted documents that went into detail concerning the large scale murder of Jews, had produced aerial reconnaissance photos of the process of cremation going on in Auschwitz and so on. Crucial documentation of what was occurring also came from the governments in exile in London, namely the Polish government with members of the Polish resistance going do far as to infiltrate Auschwitz and smuggle reports to London as well as from the Soviets who held the first war crimes trial in December 1943 and had liberated the first major concentration camp Majdanek in June 1944.

Similarly, the press did report extensively on these matters, just not in places of prominence. The New York Times e.g. [published an article in 2001](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/news/150th-anniversary-1851-2001-turning-away-from-the-holocaust.html) admitting to its own failure to report more prominently on the Holocaust. They wrote:

> Why, then, were the terrifying tales almost hidden in the back pages? Like most -- though not all -- American media, and most of official Washington, The Times drowned its reports about the fate of Jews in the flood of wartime news. Its neglect was far from unique and its reach was not then fully national, but as the premier American source of wartime news, it surely influenced the judgment of other news purveyors.
>
> While a few publications -- newspapers like The Post (then liberal) and PM in New York and magazines like The Nation and The New Republic -- showed more conspicuous concern, The Times's coverage generally took the view that the atrocities inflicted upon Europe's Jews, while horrific, were not significantly different from those visited upon tens of millions of other war victims, nor more noteworthy.
>
> (...)
>
> Only once did The Times devote its lead editorial to the subject. That was on Dec. 2, 1942, after the State Department had unofficially confirmed to leading rabbis that two million Jews had already been slain and that five million more were indeed ''in danger of extermination.'' Even that editorial, however, retreated quickly from any show of special concern. Insisting in its title that Jews were merely ''The First to Suffer,'' it said the same fate awaited ''people of other faiths and of many races,'' including ''our own 'mongrel' nation'' and even Hitler's allies in Japan if he were to win the war.

Following the less than enthusiastic coverage of this topic, on March 9,1943, screenwriter and Zionist Ben Hecht staged the play *We Will Never Die* in Madison Square Garden in front of 40.000 people in order to raise awareness of the plight of European Jews and then further traveled around the US with it, even winning over Frank Sinatra to participate.

In Britain too – though complicated by British media laws – the public was aware of what was going on if they chose to read the newspapers. The Daily Telegraph reported in 1942 about [traveling gas chambers](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/27/1422356585641/ab29aa28-7ed8-4c38-a45d-dc0b13072e01-bestSizeAvailable.png?w=300&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=422223adda84a80fa704ab4e1d4c2ff8), which given that the Einsatzgruppen did indeed use gas vans is surprisingly accurate. Simon Leader's 2004 [PhD Thesis on the British regional press and the Holocaust](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42016442.pdf) (pdf warning) shows that

> [British] newspapers were fully aware of the Nazis’ intention to murder all Jews under their control by December 1942. They all reported the events that came to be understood as the Holocaust, (some in extraordinary detail) but the Manchester Guardian stood apart because of the consistency of its coverage.

The reason, why Allied governments did act they way they did or did not act at all on this knowledge is varied and complicated but it is a fact that both an interested public and the governments of various Allied countries were very, very aware of what was occurring.

Nonetheless, the discovery of the camps and seeing the consequences of Nazi policy in the form of starved and beaten humans was a shock to those who experienced it and it was really only then – when confronted with the bloody consequences – that the troops liberating those camps as well as leadership such as Eisenhower became fully aware of the utmost criminal nature of the Nazi state.

Efforts to document these crimes had already been in place when the Americans liberated the first camps they came across. [As I detail in this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/74zl84/why_did_nazis_try_to_destroy_their_concentration/), the Allies had since 1941 expressed their goal of putting the persons responsible for war crimes on trial and had since 1943 with the foundation of the United Nations Commission for the Investigation of War Crimes created a framework for the collection and documentation of these crimes.

It was this agency and its affiliated agencies within the US Army in form of the US Army's War Crimes Branch that contributed a lot to the documentation of Nazi crimes that was presented to the public almost immediately after Eisenhower and other Allied leaders had expressed their desire to do so. The US Army had a very infrastructure for producing war reports during WWII (think Robert Capa's famous photographs of D-Day or movies shot by famous directors during the invasion of Italy) and this infrastructure together with the war crimes investigators started producing material for presentation to Allied and Germany publics alike almost immediately.

Reporters from various outlets were invited to visit liberated camps almost immediately to write about what they witnessed. Heavy hitters from the press produced reports and newsreels on what they saw there, e.g. [Edward R. Murrows report on the liberation of Buchenwald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3SCSouI8WE) that was available to the Allied public shortly after the liberation of the camp. Even the Soviets followed a similar model with famous Soviet writers such as Vissily Grossmann writing the text [The Hell called Treblinka](https://www.facinghistory.org/holocaust-human-behavior/hell-of-treblinka-vasily-grossman). Famous movie directors were engaged to shot documentaries about the Holocaust: Resnais [Night and Fog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAakK4X2_0o) was a movie that used the footage of liberation shot immediately after the war. Alfred Hitchcock [shot a Holocaust documentary](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/09/holocaust-film-too-shocking-to-show-night-will-fall-alfred-hitchcock) that was never shown but still shows the efforts that went into this documentation.

Similarly, the Allied commanders in Germany also wanted to confront the German public who largely claimed to have known nothing about this with the crimes of their regime: Germans from surrounding villages and cities were forced to bury the dead in camps and were regularly forced to watch movies about the Holocaust and Nazi war crimes by Allied commanders.

The largest efforts at documentation however were certainly the Allied post-war trials like the IMT in Nürnberg, the subsequent NMT trials, the Buchenwald trial by the British, the Dachau Trials by the Americans and so on and so forth. Nürnberg wasn't just to put the Nazi leadership on trial but also a conscious effort at documenting what the Nazis had wrought. The trial itself was filmed all the way, the documents and transcripts were published, media attention was enormous and even the selection of NMT trials was designed to highlight how every aspect of the Nazis had been criminal: Hence a doctor's trial, a jurist trial, a general's trial and so on and so forth.

So efforts to document and make that documentation available to the public immediately were made extensively and succeeded heavily in getting the information out there.

599,AskHistorians,Did the Vikings believe that their opponents in battle went to Valhalla as well?,"We dont know that the Norse actually believed that *they'd* go to Vahalla, much less what they thought about other people.

I'm gonna let you in on an open secret about the early Middle Ages.  We dont know anything about the beliefs of the Norse.  We cannot name a single tenet/doctrine/guideline for their religious tradition with any real certainty.  This is because we count the number of contemporary descriptions of Norse religion that were written down by practitioners on no hands.  They simply dont exist.  Every single source we have on ""Norse mythology"" is either a later creation, written after conversion to Christianity, or was written by Christians, almost invariably with no actual first hand knowledge.  Trying to base an understanding of their beliefs about the afterlife, cosmology, and so on without primary sources is a little difficult as you might imagine!

All of the hallmarks of Norse mythology we know and love and see repeated in games, movies, books and so on are ultimately derived from sources that arent actually depicting Norse beliefs.  Odin as chief of the Gods, valkyries carrying the glorious dead to Valhalla, Loki as a trickster and agent of Ragnarok, and so on, all of this comes from a handful of sources most written in Iceland, centuries after conversion.  So why should one small group of sources from one corner of the Norse world stand in for the entire culture across its history across a geographic span from America to Russia and over several centuries?

Now to be clear there are evidently some elements to the stories that preserve some form of belief from preconversion times, but the sagas were not written to catalog the religion, but to entertain and provide ways for composers and poets to show their stuff.  They were never intended to accurately convey information about pre-Christian Norse society, but they have been used to do exactly that in the intervening centuries.  Despite the fact they fly in the face of archaeological evidence.  The deities that we know and love, Heimdall, Tyr, Loki, all of whom are relatively unattested in place name evidence are common in the sagas, and vice versa deities such as Ullr rarely appear in the saga literature despite far more evidence of a widespread cult based on place names.  

So tl;dr we dont know what we think we know about Norse mythology, and it's impossible to try and extrapolate from the material that we do have to other cultures.

Older scholarship such as Davidson's *Scandinavian Mythology* and ""Gods and Myths of Northern Europe* should be avoided because they rely on outdated assumptions about the reliability of saga/eddic evidence and doesn't incorporate newer archaeological understanding.

*[""They Can Live in the Desert but Nowhere Else"": A History of the Armenian Genocide](https://amzn.to/32T7gpI)* by Ronald Grigor Suny is what I usually recommend for a lighter, basic introduction to the topic.

*[The Armenian Genocide: Evidence From the German Foreign Office Archives, 1915-1916](https://amzn.to/30LNqd4)*, edited by Wolfgang Gust, is probably the best primary source collection available on the topic, providing ample material that was reported on by German officials present in the Ottoman Empire at the time as they were then allied with the Turks.

He isn't my first choice to recommend, but Akçam definitely has some power in being a Turkish scholar who studies the genocide.

*[America and the Armenian Genocide of 1915](https://amzn.to/2CN1hI5)* by Jay Winter isn't a collection of primary sources, but it similarly provides a look at an outsiders view. American diplomats were present in the country as well, and likewise are important witnesses for our understanding of what was going on at the time. *[The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response](https://amzn.to/30I9PrU)* by Peter Balakian covers similar ground but from a more popular history approach.

If you want to really get to the niche topics, *[The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies](https://amzn.to/30HG0HT)* edited by Richard G. Hovannisian is an edited volume with essays tackling various aspects of the genocide in detail. It isn't a full history, but rather a way to learn about various details.

*[In God's Name: Genocide and Religion in the Twentieth Century](https://amzn.to/2EaIFCc)*, edited by Omar Bartov, has a very interesting essay by Ara Sarafian, ""The Absorption of Armenian Women and Children into Muslim Households As a Structural Component of the Armenian Genocide"" which looks at aspects of the genocide beyond the killing, and how women and children were forced to convert and assimilate into Turkish households.

There is also *[Survivors: An Oral History of the Armenian Genocide](https://amzn.to/3f07JZr)* by Donald E. Miller & Lorna Touryan Miller if you want something with a more personal voice of the victims themselves.

*[Children of Armenia: A Forgotten Genocide and the Century-long Struggle for Justice](https://amzn.to/2EgNWZ8)* by Michael Bobelian is much less academic, but I found to be an interesting, and heartfelt, look at the meaning of the Genocide especially within the diaspora community

Hope that helps!"
601,AskHistorians,Why did European Bowler hats become part of traditional women's dress for the Aymara people in Bolivia and Peru?,"> Hay una tendencia a la romantización de la chola... La esencia de la chola la están volviendo la ropa… se está poniendo a la chola como
una caricatura. Pareciera que nosotros como sociedad, estamos queriendo compensar estos
quiebres, estas faltas que tenemos para con la mujer de pollera, ensalzando su pollera y no

-Sayuri Loza, 2019

In 2013 the mayor of La Paz declared the ""Cholita Pacena"" to be an official [""Intangible Cultural Heritage""](https://ich.unesco.org/en/what-is-intangible-heritage-00003) of the city, and I've spent 7 years trying to figure what exactly that means.

Most Intangible Cultural Heritage is things like [music or food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists). Several Bolivian festivals are on the UNESCO list: [Oruro's Carnaval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnaval_de_Oruro) and [Alasitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alasitas) in La Paz. None of the items are people.

Before we get into that... who is the *chola*? 

The term comes from colonial Spain's obsession with heritage and bloodlines. While the *casta* system of strict racial heirarchies was not as prominent in South America as it was in Mexico, ""chola,"" which originally meant the child of one indigenous parent and one *mestizo* parent, did see frequent use in the Andes. It would come to refer specifically to rural women who came into cities to sell at markets and to work domestic jobs- women who lived in Aymara towns (the most populous highland indigenous group) but spoke Spanish and did business. Naturally, chola apparel became a cosmopolitan mix of styles. The bowler hat/derby hat/*bombin* is not traditionally Bolivian so much as it is traditionally *chola*. 

But why, of all things, a *bowler hat*?

Popular answers to this question center on the construction of a railroad from La Paz to Peru by a British company. This scenario puts British people in Bolivia just before they seem to have become popular, and explains why the trend is limited to La Paz (though it can be found in many parts of the country nowadays). Some say a shipment of hats for men was too small, so the women wore them instead. Some say they simply sent too many. Some say a clever British businessman, who could not sell his hats to men who already owned them, convinvced some women that the hats encouraged fertility. Variations on this appeared at least as far back as the '60s; I haven't been able to find any earlier references.

How reasonable is this narrative?

Between 1870 and 1930, companies in North America and Europe spent millions to develop the infrastucture of Latin American countries. This was entirely for their own benefit, as their industrializing economies needed the copper, iron, and tin found in the region. Before the 1880s, the tin and silver from Bolivian mines had to be transported by mule or llama. The process was slow and, more importantly, terribly expensive. One contemporary source suggests that 10,000 Bolivian silver ""mines"" had been abadonned simply because of the cost of transport.

Local companies that attempted to modernize their own infrastructures typically lacked the capital to do so. Both Chilean and Bolivian firms planned railqays to link highland mines to coastal ports, but were hindered by the steep cost of material and equipment. And while the War of the Pacific between these two countries ended in 1884, it wasn't until 1904 that a treaty resolved the current territorial boundaries. That treaty robbed Bolivia of its port at Antofagasta, a decision that [continues to be contested](https://images7.memedroid.com/images/UPLOADED118/56089cf932672.jpeg). The railroad connecting Antofogasta to Oruro, and thus the rest of Bolivia, was only completed once British investors took notice.

Often, foreign companies would continue to own and operate railroads and utilities once they were built, much as they did (and still do) with the mining operations they connected. The British-owned Antofogasta and Bolivia Railway Co. completed their work in 1892, but exerted influence over most every new railway built in the country for the next several decades. When the US-owned The Bolivia Railway Co. drafted plans to extended the network into Western Bolivia, the British company lobbied for a government intervention that granted them a majority stock share.

It's very likely, then, that British involvement in Bolivian railways at the turn of the century caused the diffusion of the bowler hat into the La Paz region. This theory is stated in passing in many publications, though never with any footnotes or citations. The *bombin* is conspicuously overlooked in both English and Spanish literature; instead, it focuses mostly on the *pollera*, the large, colorful, layered skirts that give their name both to the *mestizo* women who wear them (*mujeres de pollera*) and to the the complete outfit. To wear *pollera* is to wear the hat, the jewelry, the shawl, and all the rest.

That leads us to the more interesting question: why are there so many legends about the origins of the Paceña chola's hat?

___

The first answer is that the trend seems a lot more unusual in retrospect than it would have seemed at the time. 

There's no good date for when the bowler first became the hat of choice. Christine Beaule, Nell Haynes, Kate Maclean, Andrew Canessa, and Mary Weismantel have written with incredible insight on the politics and signfiicance of *chola* fashion, but spend little to no time on the history of hats. The Museo Nacional de Etnografia y Folkore put on an incredible exhibit of historical photographs of cholas in 2015, which I had the privelege to visit and has an extensive [digital catalog](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uijeuny78pZNr51p_3pVZEj4p6KuGD0C/view?usp=sharing)- yet hats get barely any attention. A brief 1987 study by Lissette Canavesi de Sahonero, one of the first to formally document chola fashion, quotes a La Paz resident who knew an Italian, Don Domingo Soligno, who set up shop in the city in 1920 and brought the noted Borsalino brand to a new market. It's unclear when that was though- it's simply described as ""later"" or ""after.""

What we can say is that the trend was well-established by the 1920s. A 1924 travelgoue by one C.K. Michener describes the hats of *mestizo* cholas:

> If she is of high caste, she wears a wide-brimmed bowler of glazed white straw, and if lower in the *chola* scale a smaller affair of felt. Perched, in either case, at a slight and seemingly unconscious angle.

These round straw hats are certainly a local invention, and not a ""proper"" derby hat. A similar thing is described in the paintings of Bolivian-American Antonio Sotomaoyr, in which women wear:

> stiff, glossy Panama bowlers that look like fanciful debry hats

Much earlier, in 1905, the geographer Arthur Hill observed that:

> Cholo women, that is the half-breed Spanish and Indian, are in marked contrast to the pure Indian women, since they wear finely-plaited straw hats jauntily placed on the side of their heads

As with other sources from the start of the century, Hill explicitly associates a specific hat with *mestizo* women. Whether or not these hats were round bowlers is not stated; however, the ""jaunty"" placement is something foreign observers continue to remark today.

That women would wear hats at all was also not unusual. A [1912 commerce report](https://books.google.com/books?id=ktpXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=%22commerce+of+bolivia+for+1912%22&source=bl&ots=QDz9pOCtd8&sig=ACfU3U0a6yoG-kY4jF8NQTd4ZDLYwineHQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiPicWYptbrAhXVVc0KHX73BPEQ6AEwAHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22commerce%20of%20bolivia%20for%201912%22&f=false) says 50,000 Bolivianos worth of women's hats were imported. This is just a sixth of the value of imported men's hats- but boy did they import a lot of hats. Of the 50 categories of manufactured goods listed, men's hats is the 11th highest. The value of imported women's hats is greater than that of cosmestics, of agricultural equipment, and of many other goods.

The earliest photographs of cholas show both the [white, straw](https://i.imgur.com/5eeW3yW.png) version and the now-standard [smaller, felt](https://i.imgur.com/9snidO1.png) version. Both of these images can be found in the MUSEF catalog linked above and likely date to the first decade of the 20th-century.

Sketces from Charles Wiener's *Perou et Bolivie*, based on his 1875 travels though the Andes, show women wearing a [diversity of brimmed hats](https://i.imgur.com/dFX0fT6.png) that aren't quite bowlers, but aren't that different. [This 1870 photograph](https://i.imgur.com/7TAIFI2.png) is unfortunately difficult to make out, but the woman's hat definitely has a narrow, curved brim. Melchor Maria Mercado completed an album of sketches and watercolors in 1859, which shows women in [short, brimmed hats](https://i.imgur.com/G3qI0IL.png) and what appears to be a [top hat](https://i.imgur.com/EP89eVe.png). Such a hat can be seen worn by women in the bottom right of [this sketch](https://i.imgur.com/CW2UKDn.png) from 1830; the author Edmond Temple describes as similar to a [Welsh hat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Can3442.jpg/220px-Can3442.jpg) with a short brim."
602,AskHistorians,I'm a well-do Roman aristocrat in Rome during the 2nd century. My wife has been showing an interest in this Syrian cult called Christianity. What am I likely to feel about this?,"We, in fact, have a text about a well-to-do Roman aristocratic woman from Carthage converting to Christianity in the late 2nd century: *The Passions of Perpetua and Felicity*, a first-person narrative apparently written by Perpetua about her time in prison and martyrdom for refusing to rescind her Christian faith. We unfortunately do not have any text about Vibia Perpetua's life before her martyrdom, and her husband is curiously absent from the text, despite her being described as newly-married and having a young son she is still nursing. This could be caused by a number of things: he could have truly abandoned her and not visited her in prison, leaving her to the mob; he could have been away or recently died (although that is unlikely or she would've been identified as a widow); he could have been edited out by later scribes who wanted to emphasize her as a woman of God (the earliest manuscript we have is from the 10th century, so there was plenty of time for the text to be edited in this manner); or he could have been a prisoner with her, as some have suggested Saturus is her husband, but again his presence edited out.

We can perhaps then look to her family for an example of how 2nd century pagan Romans would have felt about someone close to them converting to Christianity. Her family, and particularly her father, visit her while she is imprisoned begging her to rescind her beliefs and trying to grant her a pardon. The Roman officials too at her trial beg her to rescind and have pity on her grieving family, however when she refuses, she is sentenced to death.

From this account, converting to Christianity does not necessarily seem like something they are embarrassed about, as the father comes to the public forum for her trial and does not seem ashamed, but this could be the desperate acts of a grieving man. The official also does not seem to think that this is a shameful thing- Romans had lots of gods and they always welcomed more, after all- his biggest concern is that she offer a sacrifice for the emperors and also respect their state religion, in addition to her own. It could be a source of embarrassment to be consorting with slaves, as she was, but that isn't acknowledged in this text, as there is a great focus on breaking ""worldly"" familial ties (including ceasing nursing her own infant son and giving him to her family to care for) and focussing on the kinship of the Christian community and the world to come.

There is evidence that this affected the family's social standing, however, as the father is beaten during the trial, something that his status as a Roman man should protect him from, and the family definitely wants her to reconsider her decision. Though whether that's because it is an embarrassment to the family or because they know it may be a danger to her, it's difficult to say. Using this text is clearly problematic for a number of reasons, particularly because, as this is a religious text, it is not necessarily intending to give a clear and accurate narrative of events, but instead is more intent on Perpetua's spiritual journey and dreams.

I think it's also important to note that by the 2nd century in the Roman Empire, *sine manu* marriage was more common than *cum manu* marriage, which meant that a bride stayed under the household and *patria potestas* (power of the father or head of household) of her own father, rather than the husband's. Looking for a husband's view then may be less important than looking at her father's.

603,AskHistorians,Where did HP Lovecraft come up with the idea of Cthulhu? It doesn't look like anything in ancient Greek or Roman mythology so did he have another origin for it?,"In 1919, H. P. Lovecraft had a dream, which he described in letters to two friends (*Letters to Alfred Galpin* 87-88, *Letters to Rheinhart Kleiner* 188-189), and formed the basis of entry #25 in his Commonplace Book, a sort of journal where Lovecraft included plots. It was as follows:

> Man visits museum of antiquities—asks that it accept a bas-relief he has just made—old and learned curator laughs and says he cannot accept anything so modern. Man says that 

>> ‘dreams are older than brooding Egypt or the contemplative Sphinx or garden-girdled Babylonia’

> and that he had fashioned the sculpture in his dreams. Curator bids him shew his product, and when he does so curator shews horror. Asks who the man may be. He tells modern name. “No—before that” says curator. Man does not remember except in dreams. Then curator offers high price, but man fears he means to destroy sculpture. Asks fabulous price—curator will consult directors.

> Add good development and describe nature of bas-relief. [Cthulhu]

Steve J. Mariconda notes in ""The Emergence of Cthulhu"" (*Lovecraft Studies* #15, 1987), that on the same day Lovecraft hatched the plot, he had been reading Lord Dunsany - which will be important later.

From this basic idea H. P. Lovecraft outlined [""The Call of Cthulhu""](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx) April 12-13, 1925, and actually wrote the story a year later in August or September 1926 (S. T. Joshi, *I Am Providence* 2.600-601, 636-638).

There were several significant influences on ""The Call of Cthulhu"" - the plot element of creating the bas-relief in dreams is evident from Guy de Maupassant's [""The Horla""](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10775) (1887); Theosophy, with its cosmic cycles and strange entities that came down to the stars:

> Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed. There had been aeons when other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had great cities.

...and A. Merritt's [The Moon Pool](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/765) (1918), which is set in the strange ruins of Nan Matol in Ponape.

> Remains of Them, he said the deathless Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in the Pacific.

But the most immediate influence is the artificial mythology of British fantaisiste Lord Dunsany, which began with [The Gods of Pegāna](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8395) (1905); there is actually a specific reference in ""The Call of Cthulhu"" to one of Dunsany's stories:

> The Thing cannot be described—there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own.

This is a reference to Act III of Dunsany's [The Gods of the Mountain]():

> MAN You were all green, Master, all green in the gloaming, all of rock again as you used to be in the mountains. Master, we can bear to see you in flesh like men, but when we see rock walking it is terrible, it is terrible.

> AGMAR That is how we appeared to you?

> MAN Yes, Master. Rock should not walk. When children see it they do not understand. Rock should not walk in the evening.

The idea of gods sleeping for a time, seeming dead, appears to be taken from Dunsany's [""A Shop in Go-By Street""](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11440/pg11440-images.html) from *Tales of Three Hemispheres*:

> At that he moved heavily and slowly in way-worn carpet slippers, panting as he went, to the back part of his shop, and I went with him. This was a dingy lumber-room full of idols: the near end was dingy and dark but at the far end was a blue cærulean glow in which stars seemed to be shining and the heads of the idols glowed. ""This,"" said the fat old man in carpet slippers, ""is the heaven of the gods who sleep."" I asked him what gods slept and he mentioned names that I had never heard as well as names that I knew. ""All those,"" he said, ""that are not worshipped now are asleep.""

> ""Then does Time not kill the gods?"" I said to him and he answered, ""No. But for three or four thousand years a god is worshipped and for three or four he sleeps. Only Time is wakeful always.""

> ""But they that teach us of new gods""—I said to him, ""are they not new?""

> ""They hear the old ones stirring in their sleep being about to wake, because the dawn is breaking and the priests crow. These are the happy prophets: unhappy are they that hear some old god speak while he sleeps still being deep in slumber, and prophesy and prophesy and no dawn comes, they are those that men stone saying, 'Prophesy where this stone shall hit you, and this.'""

The actual physical appearance of Cthulhu:

> If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful.

A number of suggestions have been put forth by fans and Lovecraft scholars over the years; Phillip A Schreffler in *The Lovecraft Companion* suggested Lord Tennyson's [""The Kraken""](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/kraken) (1830); Robert M. Price poo-poo'd the idea in the introduction to *The Cthulhu Cycle* (1996), and suggested the tentacle'd nature of Cthulhu owed something to M. R. Jame's [""Count Magnus""](http://www.thin-ghost.org/items/show/135) (1904), and further notes the close similarities between Cthulhu as an aquatic giant in the last part of ""The Call of Cthulhu"" and the depiction of Dagon in Lovecraft's [earlier eponymous tale](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/d.aspx).

So the *idea* of Cthulhu was percolating in Lovecraft for some time; he borrowed portions of concepts from other writers - artificial mythology, sleeping gods and mountainous size from Dunsany; the alien origin and creepy cults from Theosophy (this is actually made more explicit in the text); the telepathic dream-sendings from Dunsany and de Mausauppant - the octopus/dragon mixture is a little hard to pin down, since Lovecraft never went into specifics about his influences on that in his letters, although he did provide [a sketch](https://lovecraftzine.com/2012/03/23/cthulhu-drawn-by-h-p-lovecraft-himself/) of the idol. But tentacles were not unfamiliar in weird fiction in the period; in addition to M. R. James' ""Count Magnus"" I would also add Arthur Machen's [""Novel of the Black Seal""](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0601861h.html) (1895) and the alien invaders from H. G. Wells' [The War of the Worlds](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36) (1897-1898), both of which Lovecraft had read.

After ""The Call of Cthulhu"" was written, Lovecraft developed the idea further, positing Cthulhu as the leader of an extraterrestrial race of ""Cthulhu-spawn"" in [At the Mountains of Madness](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/mm.aspx) and a Great Priest and cousin to the Old Ones in [The Dunwich Horror](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/dh.aspx). You can read more about that in Price's ""Cthulhu Elsewhere in Lovecraft"" in *H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos*."
604,AskHistorians,"Were the 'legendary' names of ancient Greece common among the population of the time? Ie: were there people named Hercules, Icarus, Midas, Narcissus, Odysseus, etc getting around?","The short answer to your question is that, yes, there would have been real people with the names of heroes and gods, but no, they were not common.

The long answer is that Ancient Greek naming conventions are a complex and fascinating topic. On the one hand, there are no surviving sources that explain to us how or why the Greeks came up with names for their children. Ancient authors do not seem to have found this topic interesting enough to write about. On the other hand, Greek names form a tremendously large body of evidence - the [Lexicon of Greek Personal Names](http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/) claims to have published as many as 215,000 so far - and the fact that most names are composed of words with a direct meaning in Greek means that they present a unique window into the social world of Ancient Greece. Because of their components and their meaning, names can often tell us about people's place of origin, family ties, social status, cult practices, looks, and so on. 

With the exception of some restrictions on the naming of slaves, there do not seem to have been any particular rules about what people could and could not be named. We might expect, for instance, that it was frowned upon to give your child the literal name of a god or goddess, but there's no evidence that the Greeks actually found it taboo. Admittedly the names of divinities, while becoming more popular after the 1st century AD, are rare enough in the Classical period (5th-4th centuries BC) that individual known cases have been extensively discussed by scholars. However, they are not altogether absent. There certainly *were* people named Artemis and Leto. This shows that there were no hard limitations to what a child could be named, but only conventions by which most names were chosen. The only names that genuinely don't seem to have been used at all were those of underworld gods (Persephone, Hades).

So what were the conventions they stuck to? One of the most powerful factors, especially among elite families, was the names of ancestors; some sons were named directly after their fathers (such as Perikles, son of the famous Perikles), while others were named after their grandfathers (like Kleisthenes, father of democracy, grandson of Kleisthenes the tyrant of Sikyon). Modern scholars are on pretty firm ground when they assume that people with similar names are related; often a name would ""run"" in just one family, sometimes for centuries. A related strong influence was the desire to express social status (again especially among the rich), which meant that many wealthy people would have names that contained words like *aristo-* (the best), *-archos* (leader), and especially mutations of the word *hippos* (horse). The latter is often regarded as a firm indicator of high status, since only the richest men in Greece would be able to afford to own horses, and horse-riding was the favourite pursuit of the leisure class. Famous examples include Perikles' father Xanthippos (""yellow horse""), the physician Hippokrates (""horse power""), and Philippos II of Macedon (""horse lover"").

If there were no particular traditions binding new parents, they would be able to choose a name they liked. Endless possibilities are known. Particularly striking to us, though not necessarily the most common, are male and female names that contain a direct reference to warfare - Kallimachos (""beautiful battle""), Archestrate (""army-leader""), Nikomachos (""victory in battle""), Andromache (""battle of men""), Deinomache (""terrible in battle""). Other names are more straightforward, like Leon (""lion""), Kephalon (""head"") or Melissa (""honey""). People were named after cities, mountains, and, very commonly, rivers; Aristotle complains about rare and ridiculous names like Hermokaikoxanthos, a pile-up of the names of 3 rivers. Generally, words like *kalos* (beauty), *stratos* (army), *agora* (marketplace), *demos/damos* (people), *-anax* (king) and old values like *bia* (strength) and *kratos* (power) occur often in what we might call ""posh"" Greek names. Names ending in *-kles* (Perikles, Themistokles, Damokles) refer to *kleos* (glory). The combinations of these words don't always make sense; what sort of a name is Isagoras (""equal marketplace"") or Iphikrates (""strong strength"")?   

Interestingly, while the actual outright names of gods are extremely rare, by far the most common type of name in Ancient Greece was actually the *indirect* reference to a god or goddess. There were 2 ways to do this. First, the name of a god could be easily adapted into an adjective form, so as to become a name *derived* from a god rather than the god's name itself. Some of the most common were adaptations of Apollo (for example into Apollonios), Dionysos (Dionysios), Artemis (Artemisia) or Demeter (Demetrios); the latter is still in common use now, in its vowel-shifted form of Dimitri. One of the most famous examples of such a godlike name is Alexander the Great's companion Hephaistion (from Hephaistos). The second way to adapt divine names was to add words to them - most commonly *kleos* (glory),*-doros* or *-dotos* (gift, given). So we have authors like Diodoros (""god-given"" - the reference is to Zeus), Apollodoros, Asklepiodotos; in the Roman era, when Eastern gods made their way into Greek lands, new names like Isidoros (gift of Isis) crop up. While it has proved impossible to say with categorical certainty that names are an indication of which gods were being worshipped in a given place, regional patterns are very clear in the evidence, and names derived from gods are at least a clear indication of which divinities were considered important. Perhaps the most touching are the few cases when parents who consulted the oracle on matters related to childbirth would name their child after the god who had advised them or after the place of the oracle.

Given all these factors and trends, it's perhaps easy to understand why the literal names of heroes were not commonly used as names, even if there were no strict rules or moral taboos against them. There wouldn't have been any family tradition to do so; there was no social credit in making pretentious references; since mythological figures were not always the recipients of cults, they wouldn't often have been credited for advice or protection in childbirth. It's possible that their names would have been regarded as old-fashioned or an ill omen, given the fates of most of them. According to the searchable part of the Lexicon, Ikaros is attested just 20 times; Narkissos a more respectable 74 times. I can't find a single person named Odysseus. Only the hero Iason has a famous ""real-life"" counterpart in the 4th-century Thessalian tyrant Iason of Pherai.

606,AskHistorians,"Why did San Francisco, not Oakland, become the dominant city in the Bay Area?","There’s no single reason the city on the peninsula became and remained dominant, but several interlocking reasons—including mere inertia.

First, the Presidio, which the Spanish had originally established to enforce their claim to San Francisco Bay, passed to the United States along with California.  That provided a center of gravity as the first Anglo settlements began to arise around the bay, and the settlement at Yerba Buena prospered, only a short walk from the Presidio’s protection, personnel, and connections to the outside world.  Second, San Francisco Bay is naturally deeper on its west side than its east, so piers and landfill out to water deep enough for anchorage of oceangoing ships was easier in San Francisco.  The refusal of the owner of the Mexican rancho including what is now Oakland, Don Luís Peralta, to sell his land for development of a rival town meant that San Francisco dominated the matchless bay when the Gold Rush in 1849 brought tens of thousands of fortune-seekers. Though there were wagon roads to the Gold Country, Sacramento, Monterrey, Stockton, and the various new towns springing up around the bays and sloughs were most conveniently connected by water transportation to San Francisco. Railroads in California were still 15 years in the future.

When railroads came in the 1860s, including the transcontinental connection finished in 1869, there were dramas of mergers and acquisitions that swung back and forth, with the Big Four railroad tycoons playing the various interests on either side of the bay against each other.  The rail line from the east via Stockton and Altamont Pass could almost as easily cross the shallow bay at Dumbarton to reach San Francisco as to turn north toward Oakland (or it was feared, a rival port on Yerba Buena Island). Even though the Central Pacific built its two-mile Long Wharf at Oakland in 1868, it displaced relatively little commerce from the San Francisco docks. 

The 1906 earthquake and fire might seem at first like a chance to reconsider economic and geographic situations, but such disasters don’t change land ownership. Even a farsighted city plan by Daniel Burnham, ready for public release, lay untouched in boxes in San Francisco’s City Hall as the city’s business leaders rushed to rebuild the same city in the same place.  By then, railroad connections down the Peninsula and thence eastward, and railcars ferried across the bay, provided good-enough freight handling for the city.  More important, the banks, law firms, accountants, courts, and related institutions had set up in San Francisco, not Oakland. It’s worth noting that while Oakland had plenty of land (and drinking water) for the first several decades of settlement, the Berkeley Hills would eventually limit its inland growth. 

The introduction of containerized shipping, and related labor strife, did eventually lead to Oakland and other East Bay ports becoming more important for marine commerce.  But by then—much like Manhattan—San Francisco had developed an importance far beyond that of a mere port facility.

The first couple of chapters of Mel Scott’s book *The San Francisco Bay Area: A Metropolis in Perspective* give a concise summary of the changing fortunes of settlements on San Pablo and San Francisco bays, and how the one at the end of the Peninsula became “the mother of cities.”"
607,AskHistorians,Why do Americans pronounce the letter Z as 'Zee' whilst the rest of the English speaking world pronounces it 'Zed' ?,"'Zed' was the original form in English, coming from the Greek letter 'zeta.' Starting in the seventeenth century, 'zee' became an acceptable alternative in England by analogy with other letters (bee, cee, dee...), and both were brought over to the Americas. Noah Webster, when compiling his famous dictionary which was the source of many divergences in American/British English, states flatly in 1828 that the correct pronunciation is 'zee,' although the Oxford English Dictionary quotes a source from 1882 that claims the American South still uses 'zed.'

There's really not a whole lot more to it than basic linguistic changes.

608,AskHistorians,"Apparently Blackbeards favourite drink was rum and gunpowder. Was gunpowder regularly consumed in the past, was it dangerous, did it add flavour? Is it still used today in food / drink?","#Was Gunpowder Regularly Consumed?

I would not go so far as to say that it was regularly consumed. But it certainly was not unheard of. 

##Gunpowder and Saltpeter

Gunpowder consists of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter (potassium nitrate). The latter of these three had been used to cure meat since the Roman times. Reportedly, ""by around 200 BC, the Romans recognized that salt from some sources contained contaminants that contributed a reddish-pink color and flavor to cured meats"" [1]. This contaminant was none other than saltpeter. 

By the mid-17th century saltpeter was widely used as a ""relatively [available]"" meat preservative [2]. At times gunpowder would be similarly used, on the basis of its saltpeter content. Rabbi Henry Cohen, writing in 1900, relates the tale of a US military expedition to confront American Indians on the frontier, as they sought to oppose the expansion of the railway onto their lands. Following a brutal battle, the American garrison's supplies began to run low. Cohen explains that after four days under siege by the Indians, ""the meat [...] began to get putrid, and it was sprinkled with gunpowder, in the hope that the saltpeter in the powder would aid in preserving the meat or make it a little less unpalatable"" [3]. (Alas, it was not effective). Thus there was clearly widespread knowledge of the use of saltpeter as a preservative, and under extreme circumstances, gunpowder might be used as a source thereof.

##The Link between Gunpowder and Rum

With more relevance to Blackbeard's drink, the mixture of gunpowder and rum would have been fairly well known. Not for consumption's sake, but to establish the rum's proof. Sailors would mix their rum ration with a bit of gunpowder, and expose it to a flame. If the gunpowder caught, that was said to be ""100% proof"" that it had not been watered down (57.15 was the necessary alcohol by volume for it to catch) [4]. That said, there's no indication Sailors mixed the two for purposes other than this.

#Gunpowder and Rum in Jamaica

However, the mixture of rum, gunpowder, and other substances *does* appear in various Caribbean rituals and religions, most notably in Jamaica.

The ritual consumption of rum and gunpowder stems from Tacky's rebellion of 1760. Erskine explains that Tacky's ""warriors prepared for war by mixing rum with gunpowder and grave dirt,"" adding a bit of blood from each participant, and subsequently sharing the drink amongst one another [5]. 

The ritual persisted past Tacky's rebellion, and became a part of the Jamaican religion *Obeah.* The ritual and other elements of the religion ""were passed like heirlooms between successive generations of freedom fighters."" The drink marked the rebels' pledge of loyalty to one another and to their cause [6].

The tradition lasted at least until 1865, when Paul Bogle, a Baptist minister and one of Jamaica's National Heroes, performed it as part of his own freedom movement [6]. We find mention of it in British Governor Edward John Eyre's 1866 report before a royal commission. Eyre describes that after men swore an oath to the Bogle's rebellion, they were ""then given each a dram of rum and gunpowder to drink"" [7]. Eyre's account stems from the testimony of rural constable James Foster, who describes [7]:

> Paul Bogle spoke to the men in a language I did not understand. The men then took the oath; they kissed a large book, the Bible. Paul Bogle gave each of them a dram of rum and gunpowder, which they drank. I saw the rum and powder mixed myself in a large bottle.

#Other Questions

##Was it Dangerous?

In small doses, no. However, Thomas Trotter, a British naval physician from 1779-1802, comments on the occasional consumption of gunpowder by sailors for the purpose of feigning illness [8]:

>When at Plymouth in October last, a paper, taken from a sailor was put into my hand by Dr. Mein of the Caton hospital ship from which it appeared that deception was become a complete and scientific system. Among other articles to produce spitting of blood, gunpowder or salt petre is taken in large doses; haemoptysis quickly follows from the blood being overcharged with oxygene gas which these ingredients readily afford.

##What was its Flavour?

Charcoal tastes bad (multiple pediatric studies of activated charcoal indicate children often refuse it) [9]. Sulfur is flavourless. Saltpeter has a ""cooling, saline pungent taste"" [10]. Thus, the combination of all three would not taste particularly good, but any flavour would likely be drowned out by the rum.

609,AskHistorians,"There are two places (that I know of) in the Bible where a mob of people come to the door of a house demanding the right to gang rape a visitor - Judges 19:22 and Genesis 19:5. Does this sort of thing happen in other, contemporary ancient texts? If this was a semi-regular thing, why?","In looking at answering your question, I think you can't escape from secondary issues, being the sourcing and the translation. Because those are underlying assumptions of your question that make it difficult to answer. 

those would be (1) that the story of Sodom and Gomorrah is, or is even intended as a literal historical account as opposed to a transcribed morality tale and (2) that the english version which references gang-rape is an accurate translation of the underlying hebrew stories. 

First, most academic experts agree that the Hebrew Bible (i.e. the old testament)  is a compilation of oral histories.  See [*Schinderman* How the Bible Became a Book: The Textualization of Ancient Israel (Cambridge University Press 2004)](http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/29465/frontmatter/9780521829465_frontmatter.pdf) - [you can read a briefer summary in this PBS article](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/origins-written-bible.html)  

So when things like the story of Sodom and Gomorrah appear in the Hebrew Bible, one of the first things you have to understand is that those are transcribed versions of oral histories told by the Israelite people.   Oral histories can be extensive and detailed, but they are not in the same category as detailed written histories.  The point is themes and morals.  The morale of the story is about hospitality.  Lot has a religious duty of hospitality to strangers. he honors his duty of hospitality at great cost to himself. he was a righteous man.  The inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah were not hospitable people, in fact they were terrible and the opposite of hospitable, and they were destroyed. 

Second, there is a substantial dispute among translators whether biblical account described in Genesis 19 actually describes rape.   The hebrew word used is ידע ""yada"" (don't honestly know whether the pasted hebrew characters will transcribe).  Some translators argue this word carries the cannotation of an ""intimate"" relationship, but only a minority of uses in the old testament use that word as a euphemism for sex.  [others argue the focus of the story is on inhospitability rather than an act.](http://rictornorton.co.uk/homopho2.htm) 


To answer your question directly.  The only references in ""ancient"" texts that I'm aware of also address the same story described in the bible.   The events of Sodom and Gomorrah are back-referenced multiple occasions in the bible and are referenced in Rabbinic literature and also in the Quran.  I'm not aware of any other independent ancient texts that describe strangers coming to a home and wanting to gang-rape newcomers to town for some reason. 

However, if we look at the alternative interpretation that the primary focus of the story is about hospitality.  There are ancient arabic/persian/indian folktales that likewise tell of various ""bad things"" happening to people that are inhospitable to strangers.  Some of these can be traced to at least the 8-9th century baghdad, with earlier oral origins.  See Van Gelder, G. J. (2000). God's Banquet: Food in Classical Arabic Literature. New

610,AskHistorians,"In one of my classes, we received a list of the greatest mass killings in human history. The top was, of course, World War 2, but number two was the Mongol conquests under Genghis Khan, to whom they attribute forty MILLION deaths! Can this possibly be true? How do we calculate something like that?","The initial expansion of the Mongols was ferocious and ferociously effective. Chroniclers from one end of Eurasia to the other record staggering death totals, the impossible numbers aiming for emphasis rather than accuracy. When Europeans sacked a city, it rebuilt its walls to be stronger the next time. When the Mongols sacked Samarkand, the survivors gave up and built a new city next to the ruins; when the Mongols sacked Otrar and Nishapur, they were never rebuilt at all. Sichuan province in China counted 2,500,000 households in its 1228 tax registration; in 1282, the Yuan dynasty's first census tallied only 500,000. The population loss across from Kiev to China was so precipitous and so slow to recover that the reforestation of newly empty land *lowered atmospheric CO2*.

An obvious reason for the scale of devastation of human lives was simply the size of the imperial conquest--swallowing nearly ten million square miles and countless peoples, polities, and empires. But smaller conquests, even by nomadic warriors like the initial Turks in the Near East, did not have a to-scale destructive impact. Historians have pointed to a number of factors contributing to the Mongols having the opportunity to exercise their ruthlessness so widely.

**Experience**

Steppe nomads like the Mongols didn't life in self-sufficient isolation; they traded and raided on the fringes of sedentary society. As John Fletcher argues, this meant they benefited from weak governments that ""let"" them get away with more. Stronger, more stable governments could muster up resistance or defense--which, rather than keeping the Mongols away, made them *fight* for what they wanted instead of negotiating or quietly stealing. Generations of this helped build a *skilled* warrior culture with knowledge of tactics against a strong government. And in their conquests, ""strength"" was not always a quality of their targets.

**Drafting**

One of the Mongols' most notable features was the forced incorporation of conquered peoples not just into an empire, but into the imperial army. New soldiers from places that had resisted would be dispersed to different thousands to prevent revolts, but serve the Mongols they still would. A solid top-down command hierarchy helped enforce standards at combat and strategic levels. And those who could not serve in the military might nevertheless serve military purposes. If they were lucky, they were the Chinese artisans instructing and constructing siege engines and incendiary artillery. If they were unlucky, they were prisoners-of-war brought to Urgench and Samarkand, and forced to haul stones underneath hails of defenders' arrows to the ditches around the city--with their bodies being just as useful to the Mongols for filling in the moat.

**Tactics**

The Mongols were excellent as individual soldiers and excellent as an army. One of their most notable features was a stunning success rate at triumphing over besieged cities--in the Near East and Europe, generally considered a rather difficult task. Sometimes this came through trickery--approaching the city at first in small parties, basically pretending to be the medieval equivalent of cattle rustlers squirreling away with a city's herds...only to draw pursuers, group by group, into a death trap. Other times, with the ""aid"" of prisoners-of-war as human shields, they simply drove directly at city walls to scale them. Siege technology acquired from China, as mentioned earlier, was used as well, but it doesn't seem to have been the crux of Mongol strategy.

**Speed**

This is the most interesting factor to me, because it helps explain how the utterly ruthless conquering Mongols could transform into *rulers*. In contrast to the example of the Turks I used above, Mongol expansion under Genghis Khan was *lightspeed*. Fletcher and David Morgan have argued that the Mongols adapted to the demands and cost/benefit analyses of urban/sedentary civilization...but this is a process that understandably takes time, and the devastating initial conquests were all over by then. So mores like ""leave the city intact because it's good for your trading network"" and ""peasants are useful as farmers to supply the battalion you have staged at the fortress with food"" were not yet developed as the Mongols stormed through Persia, China, Ruthenia. They were used to their old world divided into ""plunder"" and ""obstacles to plunder.""

**What About Numbers?**

Now, the question of statistics has also come up, and I've even offered one set in the introduction--the disappearance of *two million* households from the tax registration in Sichuan. But that already should give some pause before we rubber-stamp murdered by Mongols. We know from Central Asian chroniclers that the advancing Mongols produced hordes of very un-golden refugees--some fleeing in advance, some escaping with their lives. Perhaps this was also the case for some of those people. Or disease, or deportation (another strategy of the Mongols as rulers), or *it's the Middle Ages and numbers are weird.*

But medieval demographics being what they are--an estimate at *best*, and usually more like a guess--I wouldn't want to put a number on any death toll, and I don't see Fletcher, Morgan, Hugh Kennedy, Peter Jackson, Thomas Allsen, etc. going anywhere near one. In the end, it doesn't really tell us anything we don't already know about the Mongol conquest. And with the Mongols, we don't have modern political needs like the calculation of reparations owed by a still-extant government to the remnant nations they tried to obliterate, or an insistence against nationalists/white supremacists that a particular genocide occurred. 

Instead, we can tally up the awe-inspiring reach of the Mongol war machine--people *on horseback, armed with arrows* ravaging from Hungary to Acre to China. And we can read the terror in their targets' chronicles and letters through the endless tallying of atrocities real and rumored--catapulting the bodies of pestilence victims into the city walls to sicken and kill everyone left alive; rolling up a ruler in carpet and trampling him to death; wiping out entire cities because one general's son happened to be killed in battle; executing all the male inhabitants of Balkh to terrify Merv into surrendering without a fight...only to kill its women and children along with the men.

That, in the end, is a more useful metric of the Mongols' impact than a guesswork forty million or any figure. And it's far more fruitful as a basis to study why on Earth this monstrous, unstoppable behemoth was so heavily courted by Christians and Muslims as a potential ally, and how settled Mongol rule could eventually be such an important catalyst of intercontinental trade and travel."
611,AskHistorians,How did the people of France go from executing a king in 1793 to near-unanimously endorsing an emperor in 1804? How was Napoleon able to convince people that his absolute rule was different to the kings'?,"Hello! This is a great question. It really stems more from our modern understanding (in the West) of what an ""ideal"" government is, along with a misunderstanding of the origins of the French Revolution!

Briefly before diving in, let's touch on those two misconceptions.

1. Republics or Democracies are the most liberal, democratic, best forms of government

This actually is very much a modern idea! Unfortunately it's an anachronism that we don't even realize is an anachronism. I touch on the French Revolution specifically in my answer below, but suffice it to say that during the Enlightenment, men such as Voltaire actually came to the conclusion that ""Enlightended Despotism"" was the ideal form of government. Of course this has roots all the way back to Plato's ""Philosopher King"" so it wasn't anything new, but in the West we have essentially been taught that Republics and Democracies are the best form of government, and were thought of as the best form of government in the past as well, which is not true. I highly recommend Aristotle's *Politics* for anyone interested more in this subject, as he goes over different types of government and it's awesome. As for the French Revolution as I touch on in my answer, the French were essentially backed into a Republic after other, more preferrable governmental methods failed.

2. Misunderstanding of the origins of the French Revolution

I go into this more in my answer below, but the French Revolution was NOT about the peasants or the lower classes, or even the 'enlightened' classes, rising up to institute a democracy. Virtually everyone in France was perfectly fine with being ruled by one man. The French didn't want to radically alter their government, *they wanted* ***better*** *government!* This could be achieved by a constitutional monarchy, their preferred method. The Republic, as I mentioned above, was essentially backed into after the King's flight to Varennes. Even men we identify with the Republic of Virtue such as Robespierre did not champion a Republic until it was in place and their only option. When you mention an anti-monarchical surge in 1793-1793, it's important to know that this wasn't targeted at monarchy *in general*, but at the ""ministirial despotism"" of the Boubrons specifically. Since about the 1750s voices had been growing louder that the ministers of the Bourbon monarchs held a despotic stranglehold over their people. Often the Kings (Louis XV and Louis XVI) were portrayed as little more than impotent puppets, sitting useless on their throne while a small band of debauched and greedy ministers swirled around them, bleeding their people dry. The French more than anything else demanded that this system be reformed, but they did not  as their core principle find fault with the institution of monarchy.

Okay now on to my answer! I have actually answered the same quesiton here! Please note that my writing above is merely an introduction to this specific post, but the following constitutes my full answer: [Considering that one of the reasons why the French Revolution happened was to end the French Oligarchy, how come the French later accepted Napoleon as their new emperor of France?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gli6nn/considering_that_one_of_the_reasons_why_the/)

Please let me know if you have any further questions!

**Additional Reading:** 

Interested in the political thoughts of the early Revolutionaries? 

Read Timothy Tackett's *Becoming a Revolutionary*. This book relies on primary sources, in the forms of the National Assembly's archives, letters home from delegates, and personal journals of delegates, to show what the Revolutionaries were really thinking at the beginning of the Revolution! Highly recommend for anyone who perhaps wants to dig deeper into my statements about the early Revolution being about better government, rather than radically different government.

Interested in public opinion during the pre-Revolution? 

Read Robert Darnton's *The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France*. While this is a literary history, it's the best book I've encountered that touches on public opinion before the French Revolution, which is an oft overlooked area of study. What were the French actually thinking before the Revolution? It's a question this book seeks to answer through looking at literature, journals, gossip, etc.

Interested in an overview of the Revolution?

Read Peter McPhee's *Liberty or Death*, the hands-down best summary of the Revolution I've read. I find his reading style very engaging, which is important for how long this book is! It also has the merit of doing justice to post-Thermidorian France, which is crucial to understanding the question of Napoleon's rise. Often we skip from the Fall of Robespierre to the Coup of Napoleon as if those were events that happened in quick succession, but there were **five years** in between these events. Not to mention it wasn't until 1804 that Napoleon was crowned Emperor, putting **ten years** from the fall of Robespierre. To put that into perspective, the whole entirity of the rest of the Revolution was only five years (1789-1794). McPhee does a great job of giving this often disregarded period its just dues, and certainly helps give a much fuller picture of the Revolution through doing so.

**Edit**: I have gotten feedback that in this answer it seems as though I'm discounting the period after 1792, when the French generally embraced the Republic, and those who supported it viciously denounced the monarchists. I certainly do not mean for my statement to read this way, and I write extensively on the period from 1793-1794 if anyone is interested in my further answers there ([link to my profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/myskinsredditacct)). The reason I focus on the mentality at the beginning of the Revolution is to highlight the fact that the French did not approach the Revolution with the intent of ridding themselves of a monarch. This focus is necessary to answer the question at hand, which is why the French were then able to stomach a single man rule once more. I dive more into this in a comment below ([Comment can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hs674m/how_did_the_people_of_france_go_from_executing_a/fy976hl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)), but I definitely do not discount the radical surge of republican fervor that peaked from 1793-1794. I do think it's important to point out (Peter McPhee does a great job of this in his *Liberty or Death*) that after the Thermidorian reaction, the Directory slowly eroded the enthusiasm for the republic. The Terror had already gone a long way towards this disenchantment, but after 5+ years of the Directory losing love from both sides of the political spectrum, the people of France were generally not opposed to seeing it go. The reason that I highlight the beginning of the Revolution so much in my post is because when they do see the Directory fall, there isn't an ingrained philosophy that rule by one man is inherently evil, which is the crux of the question at hand. The French are (generally) willing to accept Napoleon because they did not go into the Revolution with the mindset that a Republic was the only viable form of government. Hopefully this clears up the misconception that I'm dismissing the radicalism of the Revolution, as I certainly did not wish to give that impression. The Revolution is a large subject, and it's difficult to answer a question without letting the scope explode."
612,AskHistorians,I’m an average guy living in London in 1097. One night I kill a man and leave his body in the streets with the dagger I used. I then return to my house on the other side of the town. No one has witnessed the crime. Who is tasked with catching me? How high are the chances of me getting caught?,"So the stage is set, the body is in the street, bloodied dagger some yards away, and you, the guilty party, have fled across town (probably not all that far truth be told given the size of London at this time [though it is still by far the largest city in England]).

Now the time frame that you've specified places us in Norman England though early enough that the majority of the populace was still using Anglo-Saxon law codes and practices; we don't really get into major Norman overhauls of the legal code until the 12th century.  London is a little bit of a weird case, but we can be general enough to lay out some possibilities.  

For the sake of simplicity I'm going to assume that you and your victim are both free (slavery was still around legally for at least 5 more years in England) able bodied men engaged in some local craft.  So you've killed someone, left the body in the streets, and made it back to your dwelling seemingly undetected, what happens next?  Well obviously someone will find the body in the morning and report it to a local authority.  Who would that be?  

Now for much of the world until modern times there was no independent (ostensibly) and investigative group of institutions that sought to enact, enforce, and execute the law. Modern media translates modern municipal police departments into medieval-esque institutions such as the ""town guard"" (think the *Skyrim* Hold guards), but is that how it worked in the actual Middle Ages? In short, no.  Nor would soldiers of any description be permanently stationed within the city of London at this time for the express purpose of hunting down and investigating criminals.  So the people who are going to be looking for you are not the medieval equivalent of detectives and beat cops.  Instead word will likely spread until someone directly connected with the victim can identify the body.  Though people might simply know them based on sight depending on how well known the person was in the community.

In Anglo-Saxon England vigilantism, not a town guard or much less police force, was more or less the ""default"" method of conflict resolution between equal members of society. There was no real distinction between vigilante justice and ""official"" justice, nor did independent courts, lawyers, etc... exist at this point in England's history. Especially in the Early Anglo-Saxon period our ideas of objective justice and an independent judiciary/police force just simply were not a part of society. Justice and revenge were extremely interlinked, and the line between official prosecution and a lord taking justice ""into his own hands"" was significantly blurrier than we might imagine. 

So the kinds of people who would be investigating the murder would be the people who were responsible for/to the dead person in some way.  These could be their surviving relatives such as brothers, sons, fathers, in-laws, or it could be someone connected to them by social/political bonds, if you've killed a thane or some other dependent of a local big wig he might get involved and round up some others to look around.  Let's say that your hapless victim's family is made aware of their death and have rounded up some cousins, people who owe them favors, and others to look around and find out what happened, your victim's local patron has also been notified.  So these people who were tied to the victim in some way would then start essentially an investigation, this could be questioning potential witnesses, tracking down people known to have had problems with the deceased and so on. 

But how could these people find you specifically?  You've gotten away scott free, or so you think.  While you may have discarded the weapon and left the scene of the crime unseen, did you arrive home unseen?  You probably don't live alone in a medieval city so who saw you come into your dwelling at some ungodly hour?  Did they see the blood on your clothes that you surely have from the murder (if you are not extremely wealthy you probably don't have tons of spare clothes lying around to change into)?  Do you have nosy or chatty neighbors who might rat you out?  And let us not forget the murder weapon!  

You like any other self respecting Anglo-Saxon well to do man probably have a knife on you most of the time, and its probably what you used in the murder.  So know you're out a knife that people might recognize as yours that is alongside the dead body, and your neighbors might be a little suspicious if you were making a noise at some freakishly early hour.  So things aren't looking good, but this is all circumstantial right?  Well...that might not matter much

All of this would add up and make you a figure of suspicion, but in the absence of damning obvious evidence what would happen next?  Unfortunately for you, your personal weapon has been found at the scene of the crime and one of your neighbors recalls that you came home very late and in something of a rush with blood all over your clothes.  So things aren't looking good.

Your victim's brother formally brings a suit against you at the next meeting of the local hundred meeting (basically a monthly community court/assembly) and accuses you of murder, what happens next?  

Well this depends a great deal on a variety of factors.  Do you want to admit that you killed the man, but there were extenuating circumstances?  Did he owe you a great debt?  Had he recently insulted you?  Was he involved in a crime against you or your family?  All of these factors would be taken into account and could change both the way the ""trial"" is handled and potential consequences you might face.  In that case local notables such as important peers such as other craftsmen, the local churchmen, and a representative of the king would likely convene and decide on a sentence that befits the crime and any extenuating circumstances.  This could be exile, the death penalty, or if the extenuating circumstances were strong enough, you could instead be ordered to undertake penance instead.

But lets say that you deny everything, you've never shared more than a word with the man, your knife was stolen a week ago, and you were arriving late because you were out and about on business.  So its your word against the word of the people accusing you.  

Now this is where it can get complicated and it really matters who you know and how much they like you.  You have the option of essentially calling in a series of character witnesses to swear that you would never be involved in such a heinous crime.  These kinds of people would be your relatives, in-laws, your patron and his networks, etc...  If you are a man of good repute with no prior black marks against your honor, and able to call in some favors from your own influential patrons, this will probably be the end of the matter...unless it can be demonstrated that you're lying.

This would be a huge problem for you as you have now sullied not only your own honor by lying, but the honor of those who stood up for you.  This could entail its own punishment (likely some form of mutilation of your face or mouth alongside not being able to call witnesses or bear witness in court in the future)

However if you cannot call in these favors, or if you have previously run afoul of the law before, the number of witnesses you need will be higher and you might be in trouble.  You can appeal to an ordeal instead if you'd like to try and play for time or put the matter in the hands of God, but the Church and local authorities might not allow this if they think you are plainly guilty and trying to get out of punishment.  The ordeal is a process by which you must plunge your hand or (if you have an ill reputation) your arm into a cauldron of boiling water and retrieve a stone.  The would would be examined some time later to determine if God had said you were guilty or not.  Now this is actually probably not what would actually occur however.  If you invoked an ordeal, it was more like declaring an appeal to the Church according to Peter Brown, and in the time before the actual ordeal itself the Church would try and find some agreement between the two parties.  

This could be something like a monetary payment, dependent on the social status of the person you killed, and an agreement to undergo penance as well as swearing an oath to not pursue the matter further or try to take further violent action.

So if you decide to not go with an ordeal, the assembly will likely render a judgement based on the evidence presented, the witnesses (both in the sense of actual witnesses and character judges/patrons), and taking your own history into account.  The end result, especially in Norman times, is more likely to be physical punishment up to and including death, rather than the earlier practices of paying wergeld (literally man price, or the amount of money that was attached to people depending on their station in life).  Now depending on if you've actually been physically restrained or apprehended, you might try and escape, and this would have you declared an outlaw, able to be killed on sight by anyone, little more than a wolf as far as the law was concerned.

Now notice what isn't mentioned here, evidence, trials by lawyers, juries of your peers, judges evaluating evidence, precedent, and case law.  All of these hallmarks of modern law quite simply did not exist.  Indeed, the actual fact of your guilt isn't really as important so much as your ability, or the suing party's ability, to claim innocence and have it backed up by other members of good standing, the actual facts, evidence (rudimentary as methods the of collecting it were), and so on.  What matters is not your actual guilt, but your ability to be convicted based on your social reputation and that of your victim."
613,AskHistorians,"At what point did humans go from building their own houses, to paying someone else to build it, to then building them prematurely in hopes someone comes by needing one?","Speculative building - putting up an apartment building or houses in the hope of finding and fleecing renters or buyers - is far from a modern phenomenon. I don't think that we can say when speculative building began; in some sense, the practice is probably almost as old as urbanization. We do know, however, where speculative building first flourished on a modern scale: the city of Rome. 

From the mid-Republican period through the fourth century CE, Rome was the biggest, most notorious, and most dangerous city on the face of the earth. As the center of a Mediterranean-spanning empire, Rome's appeal was obvious. Juvenal famously complains about the hordes of Syrian immigrants, and a rich array of inscriptions in Greek, Syriac, and Hebrew attests to the teeming diversity of Rome's streets. To new migrants, the city's dangers may have been less evident: the thieves who waited in dark alleys at night, the grinding poverty that overtook those who failed to find a reliable occupation or patron, and - worst of all - the hyperendemic malaria that killed thousands every year. Rome's population was never able to reproduce itself; but the constant stream of migrants ensured that it remained more or less stable until the fourth century, when imperial patronage migrated elsewhere. 

There was, in short, constant and reliable demand for housing in Rome. And there were plenty of aristocrats ready and willing to erect, derive rent from, and signally fail to maintain said housing. The vast majority of Romans lived in the apartment buildings called *insulae* (""islands""). These were multistory buildings, usually arranged around a central courtyard, with shops on the ground floor, ""good"" apartments on the story above, and increasingly unlivable units higher up. Although a series of emperors attempted to limit the height of *insulae*, the regulations applied only to street frontage, and unscrupulous contractors propped precarious additional stories on the roof. Some *insulae*, like the famous Insula Felicles by the Circus Maximus, must have approached the 170-foot height of the Colosseum. 

*Insulae* (along with that safest of premodern investments, agricultural land) were recognized as a lucrative source of income by Roman investors. Cicero seems to have been something of a slumlord, and complains about the collapse of several of his units in a joking letter to Atticus. His tenants, one imagines, were less amused. The most famous real estate magnate in Roman history was doubtless the triumvir Crassus, who (as Plutarch tells us) liked to buy buildings when they were actually on fire (thus getting a much-reduced price from the despairing owner), send in highly-trained teams of slaves extinguish to the blaze and repair the structure, and ""flip"" the reconstructed *insula* as a rental property. Many less famous Romans got in on the rental game; the poet Martial reports that one wealthy notable derived a whopping three million sesterces each year from apartments in Rome and market gardens in the vicinity. 

When a wealthy Roman decided to build an apartment building, he (or more likely, a trusted freedman) would contact one of Rome's contracting firms. These firms seem to have usually been relatively small, consisting of the contractor himself and a dozen or so skilled slaves or freedmen. Once the investor supplied the money, the contractor would hire as many unskilled laborers as he needed and set to work. *Insulae* \- if we may extrapolate from the many well-preserved examples in Ostia (Rome's harbor) - were usually built (like most large Roman buildings) with walls of brick-faced concrete. Besides enabling the construction of soaring domes like the Pantheon's and vast vaults like those of the Baths of Caracalla, Roman concrete was a time-saver, allowing a few skilled workers to oversee the rapid construction of thick and solid walls. As long as the money kept flowing, a four- or five-story *insula* could thus be ready for occupation in a few months.

We know regrettably little about rents in Rome, save that they were usually regarded as extortionate. Rent was due once a year (on July 1), a time of great distress for poorer tenants; Martial devotes an epigram to a poor man evicted from his room and forced to live under a bridge. Like their modern counterparts, Roman apartments had managers (the same man, often a freedman, would manage all the buildings owned by a given investor), doormen (*insularii*), and remorseless rent collectors. Buildings were often known by the name of the owner, but were sometimes given alluring names (like Felicles - ""Happy Isles"") to allure renters. 

The towering, tottering apartment blocks of Rome are merely the most modern-seeming of many premodern ventures into speculative construction. The basic phenomenon is as old as rent."

615,AskHistorians,"17,000,000 people can trace their ancestry back to Genghis Kahn. He had eleven legitimate children, but hordes (pun) of illegitimate children. What was life like for these children and their mothers through his empire?","Just like medieval Europe, the Mongol rulers had a somewhat flexible attitudes towards concubinage, inheritance, and illegitimacy. But while there are some important points of similarity and even contact--yes, Mongol khans married illegitimate Byzantine princesses--the mix of politics and sexuality played out in a specifically Mongol fashion.

First, let's talk about royal women's responsibilities. Pawns though they might be in their families' use of marriage to form alliances, Mongol queens generally did not have the chance to be ornamental. The most important responsibility was running the various camps that the particular nomadic group lived in. Just like Mongol rulers had multiple wives and concubines, there would be multiple camps; just like there was a senior wife whose children had inheritance primacy, there was a senior camp.

This is actually where we get to see a little female solidarity and community, actually. The wife in charge of a camp was generally also in charge of the other wives and concubines living in it. While their sexual common denominator got bounced around from camp to camp, leaving the groups of women separate most of the time, periodically they all got together for festivals and ceremonies.

That could even be a rare bright spot for women whose marriage to Chinggis (or later rulers) was the result of the devastation and surrender of their people and slaughter of their family. Tatar princesses Yisüi and Yisügen survived the utter destruction of the royal house in 1202 to wind up as junior brides of Chinggis, who ended up running different camps but still met together. The daughters of the conquered Kereit leadership did not have husbands quite so prestigious...but they brought with them their servants, retainers, younger brothers, and a strong social and informational network.

(ETA) I should point out that above, I am talking specifically about high-status women of conquered peoples--royal women generally becoming wives, lower-ranking ones becoming concubines. However, as mentioned in a follow-up comment, medieval warfare across the tri-continental world was synonymous with victorious soldiers raping, enslaving, and/or murdering the people whose cities and villages they stormed. We have basically no firsthand accounts of surviving rape, or even women talking about surviving rape in the abstract, from the Middle Ages in general, much less from Mongol women--Christine de Pizan in 15th century France refers to rape as ""the greatest sorrow"", and there are enough traces of 'tragic backstory' sermon illustrations to show that yes, surviving rape could have a devastating long-term impact on women's lives. As far as their children went, though--remember, the medieval world had no DNA tests, and was strongly suspicious of women's sexual mores as a baseline. ""Legitimacy"" was as much a matter of recognition and acceptance as genetics.

Royal women, particularly those in charge of camps, controlled their own economic resources, including horses. They received a cut of tax revenues and of war booty, even! They could also be active in politics, especially but not only as widows. Töregene, for example, fought long and hard to keep the throne secure for her son. In other cases, women took on an intercessory, informal diplomatic or ""peace-weaving"" role. Elite women also could and did actually attend formal political assemblies, including as advisors.

It's important to recognize that not all royal women controlled their own camps. This was a question of seniority among wives, but also other factors institutional and not--social rank of their birth family, nature of the political alliance or conquest that brought them to Chinggis and the other men of his family, straight-up favoritism. The subordination of some queens to other women could be a major blow to women who had commanded significant power among their birth family and people, as they were now largely excluded from political roles.

Queens and royal concubines thus definitely had a limited sphere of action overall in heavily sexist and patriarchal Mongol society. However, they could push at boundaries and wield not just power but legal authority in their own right. And it was based at least partially on their own elite descent rather than just who their husband happened to be.

With senior wives, junior wives, concubines, kidnapping brides from conquered peoples, exchanging brides and grooms among allies, and different wives holding power over their own camps, Mongols had a roomier definition of marriage than we might expect. As shown above, this is reflected in the commonalities among royal women's lives independent of how they came to be Chinggis' partners or their place in that hierarchy.

But that hierarchy did matter, and not just in terms of who got to run the richest camp. The senior wife was the most important, and the royal succession descended through her.

In some cases, that had the result you might expect. Chinggis paid a *lot* more attention to having children with his senior wife, Börte, than he did with his other wives, even after she either hit menopause or said, ""Nope, sorry, this uterus is closed for business."" (...It's still the Middle Ages, so more likely the former.)

On the other hand, in practice the situation was fuzzier. One of his wives was probably pretty stunned to find he had *traded her*, like property, to one of his allies. One son of Chinggis, additionally, actually altered the hierarchy among his wives to make a different one senior and thus the ""real"" queen mother.

With an established principle of succession and a hazy idea of the ""sanctity of marriage,"" all the other royal children were on somewhat more equal social footing. In other words, without regal inheritance on the line, there was less of a need to draw boundaries around legitimate and illegitimate children. In fact, sometimes it was outright impossible. How these children fared was up to the present situation, needs, and desires of the parents (as in Europe, women could be very active in calculating marriage alliances for their children). There wasn't really a parallel to the western European practice of ""oh, sorry son, you can't hold the throne but have a nice cushy bishopric"", but junior sons could inherit property and participate fully in the politics of marriage.

I want to stress that scholars are juuuust starting to take seriously the study of Mongol women and especially queens. (Jack Weatherford was ahead of the game!) Bruno de Nicola, *Women in Mongol Iran: The Khātūns, 1206–1335* was published in 2017 and Anne Broadbridge, *Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire* just this summer. What I've related above will surely be questioned, expanded, altered, and reinterpreted in coming years. As a Latin medievalist, I especially can't wait until scholars with the linguistic chops start working on Europe-Near East-Mongol comparative queenship. But it's an excellent start."
616,AskHistorians,"In 1952, Republicans and Democrats were close enough that Eisenhower could feasibly run for either party. What differentiated the parties and how did people choose which to vote for?"," First, in 1952, Republicans and Democrats were NOT close enough. 
The call on both sides for Eisenhower was caused by his stance, as he did not show any sign of political movement, not even a simple word of support for any of the sides; he was a military general, and to quote Eisenhower himself:
""God forbid! I'm Chief of Staff of this Army. I've got a particular job to do for America. I cannot do it as it should be done if any man at the Capitol thinks I have any political ambitions.""
 This particular ment was made in a meeting with Douglas S. Freeman, a biographer for Washington and Lee, in a responce to Freeman's urge to Eisenhower that he should 'clean up the mess in Washington.' But still, Eisenhower did not resent politics itself; he had a republican root, and saw presidency as another form of duty that a man can do for a country.



The movement for encouraging Eisenhower as president dates as early to 1942, and at 1948 even Truman encouraged Eisenhower to run for presidency under support of him, of course at Democratic party; the general replied with a laugh and a decline. And this kind of offers came toward Eisenhower from both sides in continous manner; and such offer and support came not only from political spectrum, but also from so-called 'Grassroots'. He kept the buoyant view on involvement in politics until 1952 June, where he began his political movement.



Interesting factor about Eisenhower's run for presidency was that even in 1951 June, americans did not knew well about even his basic political viewpoint. Poll made by Gallup show 40% of democrats wanted him as president, and 33% of republicans the same. Eisenhower did not made any official political statements until then, except: He Might, not will, run for presidency if nominated-which was not even quoted by himself directly.

 Still, a republican senator Henry C. Lodge Jr. Made a flight to Europe to meet Eisenhower who was on work as supereme commander of NATO, and got assured he was a republican; Lodge then just registered his name on New Hamphshire republican primary, Without his acceptance. And starting from the victory in New Hamphshire, Eisenhower's mind began to settle for presidency, as he was moved by such support from the public, and as his own political agenda showed that only he himself was the answer for, as mentioned far above, 'mess in Washington': he thought that reformation was needed to reset and improvise all mistakes Truman made, which was unfavorable for a democrat; the leading republican candidate except him, Robert A. Taft Sr., voted against NATO and kept an isolationismic view, which Eisenhower can never negotiate about.

Thus, after his resignation in June 2nd, he began his official political carrier beginning by a speech in Abilene, his home town, in June 5. He won the president election in massive support.



In the view of voters, it is very hard to tell what actually motivated them to vote for Eisenhower: it might be just pure name-value of the great general, or a distrust for Truman, who reached the approval rate of 22% in 1952. 
 One research suggests that a turn from major metropolitan cities to conservative/republican side, was by the anxiety and fury from the stalemate of Korean war and the trustfulness which Eisenhower had; regardless of what he said in campaign, which was often vague and even against some voter's common sense. 
 As the Courier-Journal opposing Eisenhower observed: 'Millions of troubled Americans felt in him a quality they trusted. What he had said in the campaign was far less important than what he had done before and what he had been.' 
 Furthermore, the corruption scandal which Truman administration had in its final days made even the democrats enraged, and inflation with high tax rate also made dissaproval for Truman-supported democratic candidate; the slogan for Eisenhower's campaign was 'Time for a change', which fitted well with the common sensus about Truman's system.



I am no expert in American political history or political research, yet I hope this made up some of the answers. My reference is a bit weak due to my ignorance of the topic, so any backup would be just wonderful.

617,AskHistorians,How confident are we that the year is actually and exactly 2016? Is it possible that at some point in the last 2000 years there were any significant timekeeping mistakes?,"Dionysius Exiguus came up with the modern world's most-used system for numbering years (Anno Domini, sometimes rebranded Common Era) in the early sixth century. For hundreds of years, however, the few Europeans dating documents preferred to continue the traditional system of dating by regnal year. By the high Middle Ages, chroniclers like Herman of Reichanau are numbering their entries by A.D. year, but we're still not quite at the point where they're common usage in charters or in people's minds. (Court testimony from even the late Middle Ages sometimes has people figure dates from either kings' regnal year or with reference to more local events). Just to make things even more interesting, Hebrew calendar years are *also* a creation of the High Middle Ages.

And yet, in these 4-5 centuries of only scattershot use of the A.D. system, there are isolated instances of writers who *do* pick it up and run with it. Bede in 7th-8th century England is perhaps the most famous. How did they do it? Easter!

The Christian liturgical calendar(s) involves some feasts that are fixed to a date and others that are more fluid. Most importantly and controversially, Easter, the history (and present, see: Catholic versus Orthodox) of whose dating is a giant mess. The early Church decided on a date for Easter that *relates to* the vernal equinox. 

But here's the thing. As you know, and as ancient people knew, years are not actually 365 days. Hence the introduction of leap years. And the presence of leap years (in the Julian calendar, which has too many leap years and so would be a problem by the sixteenth century) combined with the decision that Easter must always be a Sunday meant that the date of Easter had to be *calculated*. Indeed, this *computus* was a crucial duty of the early medieval clergy. They made table after table that calculated and listed the dates of Easter for centuries to come. So even across centuries of sporadic *functional* use of AD/CE, the medieval Church placed an absolutely premium on keeping track of the advancement of years in terms fixed to the date once presumed to be either the conception or birth of Christ.

There are some conspiracy theories floating around about ""phantom time"" that jump off from just that lack of consistent *functional* use of AD dating in Western Christian sources. These fall apart on a couple of grounds. First, the Hijri or Islamic calendar was in use from the mid-7th century, and we can compare its advancement of years to the European. Should one posit a *transnational* conspiracy to erase or add centuries, let the stars be your guide. It is possible to date significant astronomical events, such as things retro-identified as comets with known visiting patterns or eclipses. The dating of these phenomena in ancient and medieval sources line up with what we would calculate if today were 2016 AD/CE--which it is."

620,AskHistorians,"Drunk Americans today enjoy gorging on wings, pizza, and other bar/drunk foods. However, these foods are quite new. What did drunk Americans eat before deep fryers and pizza?","I want to start with an important distinction: the drunk foods/drinking foods that people *were* eating, versus the drinking foods that polemicists denounced people for eating. Unbridled alcohol consumption and excessive food consumption became strongly linked in Christian Europe under the banner of gluttony, a deadly sin, and we'll see that relationship play out through the centuries.

In early modern Europe and colonial America, when a lot of drinking was done at taverns that might double as boardinghouses or inns, it was often a question of luck of the draw. Were you in 16C Augsburg? Good luck, because outside of standard meal hours, your innkeeper wasn't supposed to serve anything but bread, cheese, and fruit. Inside meal hours, though, you might get some serious meat to go along with your beer or wine--butchers' guilds complain bitterly about tavern owners who were, against the rules, owning and slaughtering cows.

There was also the issue of quality. While English innkeepers had to be stopped from buying too much fish everyday, suggesting they couldn't keep food on hand long enough for it to spoil, apparently taverngoers in early America often ran into the opposite problem. In her diary from 1704-1705, Connecticut teacher Sarah Kemble Knight described her hostess preparing:

> a twisted thing like a cable, but something whiter...[which she laid] ""on the bord, tugg’d for life to bring it into a capacity to spread.

To disguise whatever it was, Knight noted, the tavernkeeper dumped ~Stretch Armstrong~ the mysterious white thing into a cabbage stew. *(ETA: Sorry, thought that was a cultural reference y'all would pick up on.)*

It wasn't just the food, either. Numerous accounts from 18th century America attest to the use of dirty bedsheets as tablecloths.

But people were definitely grasping the connection between eating along with food and not getting drunk as quickly. Reportedly, a 1793 drinking contest between expatriate British and French elites in Philadelphia ended quite poorly for the British, because  Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin made sure his countrymen ate enough to keep pace with the multiple varieties of wine and enormous bowl of rum punch--paid for by the Brits, of course.

So into and through the 19th century, there was somewhat less of a ""specific foods"" mentality and more of a ""just make it A LOT OF FOOD."" Scottish general James Edward Alexander (1803-1885), traveling through America, noted that tavern-goers ate every meal as if it would be their last:

> Tables covered with meat, vegetables, preserved fruit, tea, coffee, and bread--both of maize and wheat--and soft hoe and waffel [sic] cakes

Patrons also ate like they were running out of time:

> No ceremony was used; each man helped himself with his own knife and fork [from the serving dish] and reached across his neighbor...bones were picked with both hands, knives were drawn through the teeth with the edge to the lips...Beefsteaks, apple tart, and fish were seen on the same plate the one moment, and had disappeared the next!

When they finished, they retired to the next room for tobacco and ""a stiff glass of sling from the bar-keeper.""

One thing that seems to have been light on the menu: vegetables and fruit. Well, sort of. As Christine Sismondo archly puts it: ""Fruit was usually drunk by the glass, in the form of peach brandy and apple cider.""

Quantity over quality was the rule in the infamous hotel restaurants and saloons of the frontier and settling West, too. If you're interested, [this page](http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodpioneer.html) (scroll down) links to some menus from saloons that have been published in secondary literature.

One thing that was definitely *not* a drunk food in the later nineteenth century was dessert. The creation of ice cream shops and dessert/candy restaurants for women, specifically, was part of a larger attempt to keep fragile innocent women out of the men's drinking establishments. It's not an accident that these were foods more associated with children. (The history of how candy was made acceptable to men through marketing in the 20C is, by the way, fascinating.)

By 1900, the difference between ""what drunk people ate"" and ""what polemicists claimed drunk people ate"" was taking on a new and insidious dimension: xenophobia. There was rather a long history of American tavern food being very well sauced and spiced. And *definitely* salty, which Sismondo postulates was a conscious ruse to get people to drink more. Temperance advocates saw causality: ""Condiments create a desire for narcotics,"" claimed one doctor. But everyone down to cookbook authors recognized the connection.

And in the burgeoning white nationalism of the late 19th century, good old fashioned ascetic impulses made a splash as a way to separate good white middle class Americans from the brown (especially Asian) newcomers. Spicy foods were denounced as too foreign, that horrible temptation of the Filipinos and Chinese. ""Perverted appetites"" was how Mrs. Norton's 1917 cookbook described it. Indeed, contemporary dietetic thought held that eating spicy food was not satisfying, because the spices camouflaged the good wholesome nutrition, and so people turned to alcohol to fill the void.

Of course, Prohibition activists themselves spent most of World War I harping that alcohol *was* food, or at least, that its use of grain was stripping food away from poor children and soldiers. (The medievalist in me needs to point out that in medieval Europe, yes, ale was an important source of calories for people who could afford to drink more than water). Danish-American journalist Jacob Riis certainly found the alcoholic version of wheat more palatable than the actual food served at the bars he haunted:

> brick sandwiches, consisting of two pieces of bread with a brick between.

This was not, in case you are wondering, actually intended to be eaten. 

The Prohibition era gave rise to its *own* brand of moralizing racist/alcohol/food polemicists. They ranted vitriolically about how black and white patrons mixed at underground speakeasies in Harlem, drinking and eating and *maybe having sex.* Others took a more pragmatic approach, publishing ""glossaries"" to help (mostly) white people understand the sex and food slang of the new scene:

>  Chitterlings is a tripe-like food, made from the lining of a pig’s stomach; Snouts are pickled pig’s snouts, a popular delicacy (*New York Sunday News*, 1929

The repeal of Prohibition brought with it various attempts to at least *restrict* consumption and sale of alcohol--still under the guise of moralizing alcohol and food consumption.

621,AskHistorians,Has any sitting US President ever carried significant debt or otherwise struggled financially while in office? What was public opinion at the time?,"I'm not touching current events with a 39 & 1/2 foot pole, neither directly nor by comparisons. As some other posts point out, the most financially strapped presidents tended to be 19th century, with a few 20th century examples. However some early presidents dealt with sizable debt (and moreso in today's terms cash flow). Washington had to borrow money to be able to travel to his own inaguration. Monroe owed thousands when he left office and ultimately moved in with his daughter (but did pay it mostly off previous to that). Madison neglected Montpelier and lost quite a bit towards the end. Even JQ Adams had to sell property to clear the debts of his father. The winner of early American indebtedness and wealth spent presidents, however, is Mr Thomas Jefferson. It's estimated he was worth 212M$ at peak, about half of Washington and twice Madison, and died a little above even, assets to debts. But to see why we really need to look at a larger picture, so let's talk some Jefferson.

For the most part, he carried a ""typical"" Virginia farmers debt until 1773 when his father in law, John Wayles, died and quadrupled what TJ was on the hook for. Debt was very common in the 1770s and particularly for tobacco farmers. Debates over repayment of English held debt actually were part of the 1783 treaty and factored in the 1794 Jay Treaty, with final resolution coming in 1802. In the same month (May) back in 1773, his best friend from childhood and brother in law, Dabny Carr, also died, leaving Jefferson to care for his sister and her children as well. From then on, his home in Charlottesvile was crowded even when he was away - which he was away a lot. He spent a big chunk of the 1770s in Williamsburg and Philly, then became governor of Virginia. He retired after that, but soon Martha would die, shattering his everything. He took an appointment and spent five more years away, this time in France, spending massive piles of money all the while. 

He stopped recording a ledger of finances in the 70s, but continued recording purchases as if to somehow remain in control of his balance sheet. His farm never performed how he planned and he was rarely there to oversee day to day operations, further limiting his returns on crops and goods. Returning from France, he continued to spend. Upon arriving in town to serve under Washington, he had a case of wine delivered for the new president, and a second for himself. He then bought a toothbrush, and a new painting. His book collection was worth a small fortune by this point, and he was always willing to sign bonds for his friends. His eldest daughter married a man of poor reputation, by some accounts a wife beater and by all accounts an alcoholic. For most of her adult life, he would care for her.

It got worse after he became VP and even moreso as President. 40 years had been spent in public service, and he was broke. Soon the needle went from green(ish) to red and he was truly indebted. Post presidency, he never slowed down. His house was crowded with family and visitors daily, yet all were fed and housed which took a demanding toll on the crop yield, one report saying the mountaintop farm barely grew enough to feed the mountaintop guests. Still, he didn't slow down entertaining or spending. Ironically, he eliminated 30M$ in American debt - about a third of what we owed - while his personal assets continued to spiral. In 1809 he finally finished comstruction on Monticello; the mountain top was levelled in the late 1760s and construction started in 1769, some 40 years earlier. It had been built, then rebuilt. And it had cost a fortune.

The Library of Congress had been burned by the British, so he sold his personal library to America for a fraction of what he had paid; over 6,000 books were bought for a little under 24,000$ - still, it would not clear his debt (and in true style he immediately began purchasing more books - he couldnt live without them, ya know). For the numbers, that's about 4$/book, which 1£ in 1800 equaled about 4.40$, so he recieved about a pound/book - when the average price was at least several pounds each. He was by now an absolute master of creative financing.

A few years later, in 1817, about a decade after leaving office, a friend asked him to sign a bond for 20,000$, so he did. The farmer defaulted and soon Jefferson was paying over 1200$/month just on that one loan. The farmer also happened to be the father of his grandson's wife, who was mortified when she learned of it. Jefferson never said anything to her about it, and upon seeing her for the first time since the occurance did not give his typical greeting, instead embracing her with open arms and a great big hug. While money was important, it wasn't *so* important that you'd put it above family. Not to Jefferson, anyway.

1819 caused more trouble and soon he was really massively in debt. He devised a plan - Monticello would be sold in a lottery. It was valued at about 70,000$ (1.5M today), and everything was taking shape. Then a private group of citizens in NY offered to raise the money for him, so the lottery went on pause. They raised about 16,000$ - a small portion of what he owed. By the time they relaunched the lottery campaign, the excitement had partly slipped away. One of his last acts was paying customs duties for a shipment of wine he would never live to drink. With the 50th anniversary of the Dec of Ind came Jefferson's death, on July 4th, 1826. People suddenly didn't care about bailing out his kids as much as they did him, so while he died thinking the lottery would work, it did not. Shortly after an auction was held to absolve his debts, selling his lands, mountaintop home, furniture, kitchen wares, books, paintings, and about 130 people. The family kept his entire private suite of furniture, along with some other personal mementos - the rest was carried off his mountain one by one in the arms of new owners. It would raise enough that his grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph - the son of the alcoholic - could clear his debts. At death, they were the highest they had ever been in his life: 107,000$ in debt. In today's money, it would be about ~~1.5M$~~ 2M$. About 50 years after his death the final payment on his last account was made. In 1826, just before his death, he wrote;

>(T)he wonder … is that I should have been so long as 60. years in arriving at the ultimate & unavoidable result.

He meant selling his home. The place he put his heart into. The place he so loved he went for solo horse rides around it in his 80s. The place he had wandered the woods looking for peace after Martha's death. And the place he and Dabny came as boys and made a pact. The first to die would be burried by the other under the oak which they sat under to read; it is now the cemetery at Monticello, and he knew it must besold.

The public didn't really care. Even with his personal disaster, he was a fiscally sound president. He had heralded a new era for many Americans (and nearly caused new England to secede because of it), and as long as he was a good president and didn't default, he could spend his eyes out. Some were fearful he would be re-elected again and again, becoming a life president, and they threw everything they could find at him. While that didn't really happen, he did serve two terms, followed by his ideological brother, Madison, serving two of his own. Then came another Jeffersonian, Monroe, with his two terms, J.Q. Adams snuck in for a term in 1824 but was quickly followed by two terms of Jackson, who we could call a quasi-jeffersonian. It isn't a hard picture to paint that, despite being in debt from his mid 20s until his death in his 80s, he was popular enough usher in the *Virginia Dynasty* of presidents.

While certainly not the only president in debt or  borrowing to sustain a lifestyle, he makes the list of notable occurances. A really important part of this is just how different their world was. For instance, all of this credit was issued to white men with property, always, and it wasn't as a direct mortgage, either. Apply this fact to today: back then, mortgaging your property meant losing your ability to vote.

622,AskHistorians,"According to many, Nixon's aide John Erlichman admitted that the war on drugs was done in part to oppress and subjugate black people. Is this quote accepted as historical fact?","John Ehrlichman was covicted for multiple counts of perjury (and other crimes) surrounding his involvement in Watergate. He had been instrumental in formation of the group responsible for the scandal and not only lied but also obstructed justice (another conviction). Later claims he made would further question his tendency to present unbiased and factual details about his involvement in the administration. Once credibility is lost irrefutable proof is required when making seemingly outlandish claims, which means he does not get any benefit of the doubt here. It's also noteworthy (as Baum points out) that he had little left to lose when he said this (1994) and would never recover his reputation no matter what he did. Frustrated as he may have been, it doesn't seem likely he was trying to burn everyone involved from spite or revenge.

The author of the book sourcing the quote, Dan Baum, said;

>At the time, I was writing a book about the politics of drug prohibition. I started to ask Ehrlichman a series of earnest, wonky questions that he impatiently waved away. “You want to know what this was really all about?” he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect. “The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”

>I must have looked shocked. Ehrlichman just shrugged. Then he looked at his watch, handed me a signed copy of his steamy spy novel, The Company, and led me to the door.

So we see he was being peppered with ""wonky"" questions and cut straight to a short answer, which is logically reasonable. The fact that Baum waited to release this ""smoking gun"" quote is peculiar, but not necessarily unheard of. So it is difficult to say if that's exactly what he said and if he was embellishing in the details or not.

All that said... there is a long history of using drug legislation to maintain societal desires and particularly against minorities. The biggest origination of this was the marijuana legislation targeting the black jazz movement attracting white kids to juke joints in the roaring 20s and 30s plus the Mexican immigrants out west. Even the great Satchmo (jazz king Louis Armstrong) spent 9 days locked up in 1930 for smoking a joint outside a club in California. It was one of the first American celebrity drug arrests in history. So the idea certainly wasn't new.

Id also point out the famous quote by Republican strategist and white house advisor Lee Atwater (which is preserved on audiotape);

>Y'all don't quote me on this. You start out in 1954 by saying, ""N····r, n····r, n····r"". By 1968 you can't say ""n····r""—that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, ""We want to cut this"", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than ""N·····r, n·····r"". So, any way you look at it, race is coming on the backbone.

Lee Atwater in 1981 (off the record) about the Republican ""southern strategy"" of pivoting towards white supremacy as a platform to gain votes in the south and hiding it as ""economic reform"". He was a Republican strategist in the 60s and served as advisor to both Reagan and H.W. Bush, serving as RNC chairman in the late 80s and early 90s.

So there are other indications the senior officials of the party were looking for ways to change from the race aspect to a different aspect that accomplished the same results while appearing to not be what it was - racist. This would seem to add some credibility to the claim made.

But in the end, Ehrlichman is simply untrustworthy and his testimony subsequently inadmissible without additional corroboration. Court room 101: Once a perjurer, always a perjurer. That's just good life advice, too."
623,AskHistorians,It’s winter 1929. Stocks are crashing. But it’s not clear just how bad it will be. What did the most prepared and aware (or just lucky) individuals do to prepare for the turmoil to come?,"George Whittell, Jr., (1881-1969) was the sole heir of two enormous fortunes from Gold-Rush-era San Francisco (both his grandfathers had made millions as investors). Whittell refused to work and was, simply, an obnoxious playboy who did little to manage his investments, although he frequently had to buy off women for sexual assault or men who threatened to sue him when his pet lion, ""Bill,"" mauled them. 

Whittell inherited large swaths of real estate on the San Francisco peninsula, but it was easy after the crash to be land rich but cash poor, and even the rich could sometimes find it impossible to pay real estate taxes. In what was perhaps his only act of initiative and business acumen, Whittell realized in August 1929 that it was time to draw his money out of the stock market. He later claimed that he sensed that the party was over and that when people stop drinking and having a good time, it's time to pull back: he withdrew $50 mil out of the stock market, an incredible fortune for the time, and thus avoided the really horrible effects of the crash.

This gave him the funds to continue living extravagantly and yet still pay his taxes, etc., so that his fortune was not jeopardized (he purchased six Duesenbergs and a DC2, for example). He also bought 27 miles of Lake Tahoe shoreline, land that extended from water's edge to the crest of the mountain - real estate worth billions today. He claimed that he wanted to build a hotel casino on the Lake Tahoe shore (his holdings represented almost all of the Nevada side of the Lake), but he never got around to doing it, committed as he was to doing nothing productive. He did manage to build himself the ""Castle,"" a lavish estate on the edge of the lake.

All this meant that he was either aware or lucky enough to watch the economic disaster from afar while not having it affect him in any substantial way - except to make the cash he had on hand being even more valuable for purchasing power. 

In short, to weather economic disaster: Step 1. pick your parents well so that you start with lots of money; Step 2. be lucky enough or perceptive enough to consolidate your holdings in the right way before the crash; Step 3. continue your life as a totally reprehensible expression of humanity.

My wife and I wrote a biography about Whittell together with a portrait of his Lake Take estate: [Castle in the Sky](https://www.amazon.com/Castle-sky-George-Whittell-Thunderbird/dp/0971804702), which is the accumulation of research on this not very pleasant person.

624,AskHistorians,"I just read that recent excavations of the earliest royal tombs in Japan suggest strongly that the country's ancient imperial family may originally have been Korean, and that the Japanese government has strongly discouraged further research on the sites. What is the extent of the evidence uncovered?","This whole thing isn't a debate anymore, and we kind of suffer because the book at this point is a bit aged.

It must be noted that Benedict Anderson with his Imagined Communities is mainly aiming to make his personal critique of the concept of nationalism (and, in fact, his idea of the 'imagined community' as the nature of the nationalistic group is still rather central to much of modern social sciences). Regardless of your personal view on the benefits or dangers of nationalistic mindsets, it is important to keep in mind that Anderson aims to criticise them in the book and, with his footnote, wants to ridicule the Japanese monarchy as the central component of Japanese (ethno-)nationalism that it was (and is). The aim of the footnote is primarily to discredit the legitimacy of Japanese nationalism and, by extension, the various horrors committed under its banner by Japanese forces, particularly between the 1890s and the 1940s.

My personal verson is the Second Edition of 1991, so there might be minor differences between mine and yours.

But, and this is interesting, I also have the footnote you describe. Precisely, it is on page 96. 

>While the Japanese spoken in Kyushu was largely incomprehensible in Honshu, and even Eda-Tokyo and Kyoto-Osaka found verbal communication problematic, the half-Sinified ideographic reading-system was long in place throughout the islands, and thus the development of mass literacy through schools and print was easy and uncontroversial. Second, the unique antiquity of the imperial house (Japan is the only country whose monarchy has been monopolized by a single dynasty throughout recorded history), and its emblematic Japaneseness (contrast Bourbons and Habsburgs), made the exploitation of the Emperor for official nationalist purposes rather simple. ***[29]*** Third, the penetration of the barbarians was aprubt, massive, and menacing enough for most elements of the politically aware population to rally behind a programme of self defence conceived in the new national terms.

Footnote 29 reads as follows:

>But I have been informed by scholars of Japan that recent excavations of the earliest royal tombs suggest strongly that the family may originally have been - horrors! - Korean. The Japanese government has strongly discouraged further research on these sites.

So, while I cannot personally confirm it, I would make the guess that the First Edition has this very same footnote in the very same passage, putting the date of the claim all the way back to the year 1983, when the book was originally published. This is significant because that means that the book was written during the Showa Era, the reign of the Japanese emperor Hirohito - the very same Hirohito who led his country into World War 2 through, at the very least, his passive tolerance of the actions of his military leadership, if not his active encouragement of the wars of aggression waged upon Korea, which has so often become a victim of the power plays and rivalries between its two big neighbors, Japan and China. So the context in which the book is written is one where the Japanese monarchy was far more conservative and reactionary than the monarchy we know today (and what a date to write about this, as today the emperor Akihito has abdicated in favor of his son).

The new Emperor, Hirohito's son Akihito, on the throne since 1989, plays into this story because he accepts the ties between the Japanese monarchy and Korea.

>I, on my part, feel a certain kinship with Korea, given the fact that it is recorded in the Chronicles of Japan that the mother of Emperor Kammu was of the line of King Muryong of Paekche.

* Akihito, December 2001 (see also [this report](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/28/japan.worlddispatch) by the Guardian and [this one](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/11/world/japan-rediscovers-its-korean-past.html) from the New York Times).

So, what we are dealing with here is a classic case of outdated information. At the time than Anderson initially wrote the book, the Japanese narrative would not have allowed for any ties to Korea. But the deeply flawed Hirohito has made space for his much more open-minded and approchable son (and now, a grandson whose character will show itself in the upcoming decades). 

Akihito, by openly embracing the ties between his bloodline and the Korean people, as well as his relaxed public image and his personal apology offered to the President of South Korea Roh Tae-Woo in 1990, has made admirable progress in mending the historical animosities between Japan and Korea that were driven to the extreme by the actions of his father.

So, no, no more research is necessary. The Japanese emperor admitted his Korean heritage."
625,AskHistorians,"Seven out of the ten US presidents in the period from 1869 to 1923 were from the state of Ohio, yet before or since not a single other president has been. Was this just a coincidence or was there some kind of political significance to the state at this time?","In his paper [""Broken Cradle: Why is Ohio No Longer the Mother of Presidents?""](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275334235_Broken_Cradle_Why_is_Ohio_No_Longer_the_Mother_of_Presidents), political science professor James Melcher identifies six factors in Ohio's dominance at the presidential level during this period:

* It was ""a pivotal state in national elections"" and something of a battleground state. Although Melcher admits that the state leaned decidedly Republican, it still featured more ""partisan competitiveness"" than most others during the era. It worked as a bellwether for the Republican Party at the national level at the time, which is the party that all those Ohio presidents came from. If the Republicans could do well in Ohio, they could win the Presidential election.

* Ohio politicians of the era tended to be described at the time as ""bland"" and ""nonideological"", and not as partisan as politicians from other areas of the country. Melcher posits that this might be due to Ohio having multiple large population centers, which meant that statewide officeholders in Ohio had to appeal to a broader electorate than in other states. This translated well to winning national elections.

* Because Ohio politicians were skilled at building coalitions, they tended to perform well at nominating conventions at a time that candidates were picked at the conventions among the delegates there. Ohioans often came out as a consensus candidate inoffensive to more ideological members of the party. Conventions ""rewarded a candidate with"" skills at ""strong party organization"" which Ohio politicians of the era tended to have.

* Ohio's geographic location helped it as well, with the West being so sparsely populated for most of this era, and elections won by appealing to the electorate East of the Mississippi. Due to intra-migration in the country, Ohioans were good at speaking for the country as a whole, inoffensive to more of the country than most other populated locations, where divisions and rivalries could be more hostile (especially South v. Northeast).

* Ohio had a lot of Civil War military veterans-turned-politicians, who, up until that era, were often candidates (and often successful candidates) for national office.

* Once Ohio was identified as this new cradle of the presidency, Melcher says this created ""momentum"" for future candidates. Ohioans had kept winning the office, so might as well nominate another Ohioan. This argument was being made at the time, for instance, in this [*Western Magazine*](https://books.google.com/books?id=zMAcAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA106&dq=ohio+presidents) article preceding the 1920 election when both major candidates came from Ohio.

In [""Sectionalism and Presidential Politics: Voting Patterns in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio""](https://www.jstor.org/stable/204833?seq=1) by authors Fred M. Shelley and J. Clark Archer, they make several of the same points, though broadening the scope to include Illinois and Indiana, too. Between 1856 and 1920, 8 of 12 men elected President came from one of these three state which ""illustrates the sensitivity"" the Republicans had ""to the importance of mobilizing popular support in these states"". The authors also say these three states had demographic similarities to the South and Northeast that those two sections of the country didn't have to each other: these Midwestern states were rapidly urbanizing with immigrant populations like the Northeast was, but they also had a significant rural population with ties to the South.

In [""U.S. Presidential Elections in the Nineteenth Century: Why Culture and the Economy Both Mattered""](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3235469?seq=1) by G. Patrick Lynch, the author also echoes some of what Melcher said. Ohio had elected Democrats to the governorship and their legislature in the 1870s, and Republicans found themselves in a dogfight for political dominance during the period. Indeed, Ohio's shift almost proved fatal: the Republicans won Ohio in 1876 by less than 1.2% of the vote, which, if switched, they would have lost the election (and barely won it anyway, due to the contested Florida vote). The Republicans needed Ohio to secure a Presidential win. 

This agrees with a statistical analysis done by John R. Wright in [""Pivotal States in the Electoral College, 1880 to 2004""](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40270742?seq=1), which identified Ohio as one of the most perennially pivotal states to win in elections in that period. Most specifically, Wright identifies Ohio as being the most pivotal state in the 1896 outcome, and the second-most pivotal state in the 1888 election, two elections won in the period by Ohioans. 

This electoral college importance is also offered as the explanation for Ohio's dominance of the era in the 1965 biography *The Available Man: The Life Behind the Masks of Warren G. Harding* by Andrew Sinclair.

In the book [*Ohio and Its People*](https://books.google.com/books?id=-X2j44h3d8IC&pg=PA256) by George W. Knepper, the author echoes Melcher's point about Ohio being the source of compromise among Republicans at the conventions, their politicians often considered safe, and pointing in particular to James A. Garfield's 1880 nomination during a particularly split convention as the best example.

In the book [*The Ohio Presidents: Eight Men and a Binding Political Philosophy in the White House, 1841-1923*](https://books.google.com/books?id=T7VqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4) by Quentin R. Skrabec, Jr., the author makes an argument that echoes Melcher's factor that Ohioans made good compromise candidates. Due to the socioeconomic make-up of the state, Ohioans tended to embody Republican Party and republican (small ""r"") values of the time better than most. On both social issues and economic issues, they followed the Republican Party closely, and Ohio was something of a microcosm of the social conditions of the U.S. as a whole during the period. The state experienced significant growth through immigration, and became more urban, so Ohio politicians had experience appealing to a constituency that was very much like the national electorate. The book also talks about Ohio's [electoral college importance](https://books.google.com/books?id=T7VqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA147&dq=battleground) as a battleground state, and it often acting as a bellwether of the national political mood.


EDIT: Thanks for the silver!"
626,AskHistorians,Would a Roman from 500BC have been able to understand the language of a Roman from 400AD?,"So, I love the premise of the question, but within the parameters you've given we run into a problem. You've cleverly picked time periods before and after ""classical"" Latin (the Latin of the ancient Romans as opposed to its use during the Middle Ages as a sort of ecclesiastical/elite second language, to simplify things) with the core of classical Latin literature coming from around the 1st century BC/AD. Your end date of 400 gives us a good bookend to a Latin-speaking Roman political entity -- Latin would continue to be spoken by Romans as the western empire is conquered by different Germanic groups, and even adopted by these new elites, but by 600 the divergence into the early Romance languages is pretty complete and we generally stop calling the language Latin. There are some significant changes by this point, such that a separate university course on Late Latin is often offered to acclimatize classical readers to it, but this has a great deal to do with a change in the audience, as (to grossly oversimplify things) cultural changes including the growth of Christianity have led to the prevalence of the Latin spoken by lower classes (""Vulgar"" Latin) appearing alongside/in place of the Latin of the elites in literature. In any case, a classical Latin scholar will have very little difficulty in reading Jerome's Vulgate Bible, as an example of a text from the period. I find the 2nd chapter of Luke to be a handy Christmas-time text teaching Latin at a (religious) high school; only a few notes on vocabulary are necessary.

At the core of the problem, though, the Latin of 500 BC is a very different animal, primarily because we just have incredibly little -- a few fragmentary inscriptions that are often too short to get much of a handle on, but there is enough to say it's got very significant differences. I challenge a casual reader of Classical Latin to attempt to make anything out of the text of the Lapis Niger: 

>I a 1 quoiho...
b 2-3 sakros: es/ed:sord...
II a 4-5 ...iaias/recei: lo...
b 6-7 ...euam/quos: re...
III a 8-9 ...m: kalato/rem: ha....
b 10-11 ...od: io: uxmen/takapia: dotau...
IV a 12 ...m: i: te: r p e
b 13-14 ...m: quoiha/uelod: nequ...
c 15 ...od: iouestod/
V 16 loiuquiodpo

It's difficult to quantify mutual intelligibility, but there are far greater qualitative differences between 500 BC and 1 AD than there are between 1 AD and 400 AD. Even in a significantly closer timescale to the classics, it is quite punishing for a modern reader who's quite fluent in Classical Latin to get a hang of Roman Comedy from just the third and second centuries BC, although they were certainly still intelligible to classical audiences as they were still performed. It might be useful but unscientific to consider the way that Shakespeare is perhaps difficult but understandable to us. Classical Romans also seem to have been occasionally mystified by the archaic Latin of their own religious rites, repeating phrases because they are required by ritual instead of understanding what they meant.

In the absence, again, of a good scientific method for measuring intelligibility of a language between two third parties, then, I'd posit that, qualitatively by having students familiar with classical attempt to read texts from other time periods, the difference between 1st and 4th century AD Latin gives no real problem to mutual understanding, nor a significant one between 3rd and 1st BC, but the Latin of 500 BC is a hard question to answer; still, I suspect they would be much more difficult to understand for the other time periods.

Adding on a bit of further reading: Harrington's Medieval Latin is, so far as I know, the go-to text for getting into late Latin for students already familiar with classical. The emphasis is mostly on well after your time period, but Part One does explore Late Antique Latin, and in addition to the Jerome I mentioned above, it reminds me that Egeria (the journal of a nun traveling to the Holy Land) is an excellent snapshot of Latin from near 400 AD. Grangent from the early 20th century wrote a pretty standard introduction to the mechanics of Vulgate Latin. There's less good reading on the Latin of the Roman comedies other than the texts themselves, but the standard book to point you to there is Bennett's Syntax of Early Latin. These books will unfortunately be much more useful if you're already familiar with Classical Latin (for which there are scads of texts) to have a basis for comparison."
627,AskHistorians,"Reading letters from history, I'm struck by how intimate and affectionate the friendships are between male friends. We find this between Hamilton and Laurens, and between Lincoln and Speed.

This process was rooted in one of society's most fundamental adopted divisions, gender, so you can imagine that there are a whole lot of factors implicated in the shift that are all tangled around each other and mutually reinforcing. Some of the key ones include: industrialization and urbanization, women's colleges, class concerns, a *crisis in masculinity* (masculinity is always in crisis), and most importantly, the invention of ""sexology"" as a field of science at a time that science played a central role in cataloguing and normatively ordering society. 

Anthony Rotundo, primarily studying men, argues that ""romantic friendships"" in America start to become visible in the Revolutionary War era and flourish in the mid-19th century. The 18th century is kind of a black hole for me so I'll take his word for when the concept of romantic friendships was jump-started, but it was by no means new. In the Middle Ages, Christians and Muslims alike wrote poetry and composed letters depicting homoromantic and even homoerotic relationships. I'm going back this far not for the heck of it, but because medieval society helps clarify key qualities of male and female ""romantic friendships"" that contributed to their eventual demise: a societal value on men expressing emotion (knightly tears; religious devotions) and the very, very limited possibilities for unmarried women to rise above the poorest classes. Romantic friendships did not threaten men's sense of themselves as men, patriarchal control of women, or marriage.

Socio-economic changes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries knocked all of that askew.

The 1870s-1920s saw a massive influx of young women and men into U.S. cities. On one hand, this was an age-old process that, for centuries, was basically the season cities could exist (they were population sinks--on their own, city residents could not reproduce enough to replace themselves given mortality rates). On the other, the type of work they found and the pathways for success in that work were much more recent. The old system of apprenticeships and family connections for men, and almost exclusively domestic servant work for women, absolutely persisted but were swamped by the numbers of factory workers and non-domestic service workers. To support the population boom, cities constructed residential hotels/dormitories/apartments that were often designated single-sex.

That situation made both male and female romantic friendships a threat to the gendered prescriptions of society. For men, it diminished the utility of romantic friendships as potential economic and social connections, meaning they wouldn't be stepping stones towards supporting their eventual family. For women, it opened a much more achievable possibility of financial stability outside marriage. 

The blossoming of women's colleges at this time made that problem even clearer to the sexuality reformers and sexologists we'll meet in a little--because ""these women"" were most assuredly middle and upper-middle class. In short: the ideal marriage partners for men...in an environment where romantic friendships could permit them both prestigious social roles (scholars, administrators, politicians, professional artists, etc) and economic *success* without men. This was true, even long-term, for both students and teachers. About 10% of American women at the end of the 19th century never married; the figure was around 50% for graduates of women's colleges. So when men observed, as in this letter to the Yale student newspaper:

> There is a term in general use at Vassar, truly calculated to awaken within the *ima penetralia* of our souls all that love for the noble and the aesthetic of which our natures are capable, The term in question is ""smashing.""

> When a Vassar girl takes a shine to another, she straightway enters upon a regular course of bouquet sendings, interspersed with tinted notes, mysterious packages of ‘Ridley’s Mixed Candies,’ locks of hair perhaps, and many other tender tokens, until at last the object of her attentions is captured, the two women become inseparable, and the aggressor is considered by her circle of acquaintances as ""smashed.""

they might not have seen sexual competition, but the possibility of a lifestyle threat was lurking.

Men's romantic friendships were also under fire with respect to their emotionality. The gradual militarization of western culture over the 19th century (think the Salvation *Army* or the military trappings of the Boy Scouts) drove/was driven by a narrowing definition of masculinity on ""muscles""--vigor, strength, athleticism, the Teddy Roosevelt stereotype. Whereas emotions had once been the healthy counterpart, gradually the internal dimensions of character and a value on openness and gentleness became a liability. (Marriage was still okay, because the idealized marriage was the husband/father rising up to 'be a man' and take care of his family).

Steeped in all these burgeoning developments and their implications came the sexologists, with an agenda not just to categorize society but to evangelize their ""discoveries.""

A lot of us are at least in passing familiar with the ""homosexuality didn't exist as 'homosexuality', an identity, before 1900"" trope. This can be taken too far (and often is), but it is nevertheless true that the later decades of the 19th century and early 20th century saw professional, middle-class scientists coalescing ideas of same-sex sexual relations according to Science rather than morality. Instead of a wrong step by step choice, it was an abnormal physical, inherited trait.

This idea got mixed up in Progressive Era utopian visions of societal improvement that, among other things, tagged ""deviants"" and lower-class people as hindering forward progress--just as same-sex sex, now identified with the people who practiced it, prevented heterosexual, reproductive sex.

And scientists like Bernard Talmey exhibited one of my favorite characteristics of historical men writing about women: in his 1904 book on, well, women, he announced his deep concern that the American public ""does not even surmise of the existence"" of sex between women. It was a scientific version of what I see in my medieval (male) clerics skating gingerly around actually mentioning lesbian activity because they don't want to put the idea in women's minds.

But this view of American sexologists, lagging somewhat behind their European counterparts, was crucial to the decline of romantic friendships among men and women. First, because it started off with a condemnation of these friendships that took away from social order *regardless* of whether there was sexual activity involved. 

Second, because of the label first stacked onto the participants: inverts. That is, the inversion of proper sex/sexual order. Here we meet up with the rise of muscular masculinity *against* emotionality and gentleness, as well women's political activity and independent economic power *against* the norm of a separate women's/domestic sphere.

And so romantic friendships, instead of a natural part of growing up for men and women, became an aberration--not in the sense of ""rare"", but in the sense of ""wrong.""

...Unbeknownst to the sexologists, however, their codification of language and an identity for homosexual men and women gave people who did experience same-sex attraction a *mutual* self-understanding--a certain legitimacy. It's seen as the beginning of an LGBTQ+ movement (if not yet a civil rights one). So there is a lot to mourn about the loss of romantic friendships and what it signified. But this is one story about the past that also has a future."
628,AskHistorians,"After the US elections of 1876, I understand that both sides claimed victory and that the incumbent (Grant) was prepared to declare martial law out of fears of two competing inaugurations. How close were we to having a second civil war?","Not as much as was feared at the time, although it's an interesting sideshow.

But let's start with the contemporary viewpoints in the chaotic two months between the recounts of the three Southern states still under Republican control (Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina) that resulted in moving 20 electoral votes from Tilden to Hayes and the eventual convening of the Federal Electoral Commission in late January 1877 to begin sorting out out the mess, partially because it was the peak of the potential for violence and also because predictions of the apocalypse are always fun reading. From Downs:

>One of Hayes’s strongest supporters, former senator Carl Schurz, privately warned him against pressing his case too ﬁrmly for fear of instigating “the Mexicanization of our government!” On Tilden’s side, his conﬁdant John Bigelow, former consul to France, wrote in his diary that “another civil war may be the consequence of this state of things and we may enter upon the next century under a [different] Form of govt. from that of which for nearly a century we have been boasting.” More widely, a southern Democrat worried about a “bloody revolution”; a West Point commander dreaded “anarchy”; a former attorney general feared that “the days of our republic are numbered”; a Texan pledged to recruit “hundreds of thousands” of fellow Union veterans to defend Hayes’s title; a Tilden supporter promised that if the Republicans wanted “‘blood-letting, ’we will oblige”; a Virginia woman lived “in a lamentable state of uncertainty” as “war of the most deadly kind, is inevitable”; and Missouri’s governor dispatched two prominent men to tell Tilden that the state would “ﬁght” to defend his inauguration.  Against these possibilities, President Grant called several companies of troops to garrison Washington, D.C., ordered naval batteries to protect the capital’s bridges, and reopened Civil War forts.

Even juicier was the unsubstantiated claim of what Tilden would do to take office:

>One of the most provocative rumors was that Tilden planned to stage a counter-inauguration in New York City. Backed by a line of Democratic state militias from Connecticut to Virginia, he would seize the federal Treasury Building in New York, fund his government through customs collections in the harbor, and force Hayes from the capital to his own shadow republic in the Midwest.

While this wasn't anywhere close to reality, there was actually some truth to the potential of two competing inaugurations; a contemporary of Tilden later wrote that if he'd gained title from the House, he planned to risk arrest and hold his own ceremony in Washington.  More concerning were Tilden's encouragement of the actions of George McClellan (yes, that one) who Tilden first went to New York's governor to request that he be named state adjutant general (the governor deferred) and then, undeterred, began forming something resembling a paramilitary organization:

>More revealing, however, are letters from men working with him to organize such a resistance, including former Confederate general Dabney Maury, one of McClellan’s West Point instructors. Maury urged McClellan to produce “a pose of moral and physical power too great to dare,” discussed strategic allocations of divisions, brigades, and regiments, and warned McClellan to hold units in reserve for later combat. In Massachusetts, former Union brigadier general John M. Tobin gathered an estimated 5,000 veterans into a Conservative Soldiers and Sailors Association. Tobin made tantalizing references to unnamed “potent considerations set forth” in a lost letter from McClellan. “The few who have seen it open their eyes wide, and it nerves them on...Any movement to which you may lend your name...would be the signal for arousing en masse here all the conservative soldiers and sailors.”

How close McClellan got to implementing all this isn't clear, but it looks like part of the issue was that the wealthy yet notoriously skinflint Tilden refused to fund him; whether or not the latter didn't want to fully commit down that road at that time or just was a cheapskate will never be known.

But there's also the candidate himself.  Tilden was not probably not as quite as milquetoast as many of his backers made him out to be (there's a great quote about ""A man who must have a man rub him every morning & evening for an hour or so, who must take a clyster every morning to get passage...how could such a man be expected to [demand the Presidency] and wind up perhaps at last in prison?"") but most of his plan seemed to rest on reserving any action, military or legal, until the House had named him President.  Once the Presidential Election Commission had been set up he appears to have backed down (albeit with fury towards Democrats in the House), and as many of the members of Congress who worked for it were doing so out of genuine fear of armed rebellion, it played a role - along with signaling to Tilden that Congressional support for him taking more aggressive action would probably evaporate.  Either way, he didn't really seem to have much of a Plan B, and the Electoral Commission served its purpose as a compromise.

It's also worth pointing out that part of the background to this was that the Democrats also shot themselves in the foot on multiple occasions too.  While I won't get into the details of the 1876 election and recount here - it's better suited for a top level question - their ambitious move to rush Colorado into the Union in August for her 3 electoral votes that were widely believed would be won by Tilden was a disaster.  Instead, Republicans used the late entry only 3 months prior to the election to let the Republican controlled legislature choose the electors - shockingly enough for Hayes - rather than determining them via a popular vote.  There was also the bungle of Democrats deciding to attempt to bribe the genuinely independent Supreme Court member of the commission - as it turned out, the only vote that mattered in the multiple canvasses - with a Senate seat, only to have him promptly resign from the Court to take the seat and be replaced with a reliable Republican vote.  This doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of all the mistakes made once they'd taken over the House in a landslide in 1874 and the mediocre campaign, but suffice it to say that they could logically blame themselves for blowing it rather than view the results as a sign of continued Republican dominance - meaning that they had every reason to believe the next election would turn out differently, and that probably played a role as well in their willingness to settle things peaceably.

Last but not least, there was indeed a time where civil war over an election, along with a Constitutional Convention afterwards, was rather possible.  The Election of 1800 makes even the most ferociously disputed ones subsequent to it look like afternoon tea in many ways, including the very real likelihood that Jefferson would have supported the planning by Governors Tom McKean and James Monroe to call out the militias of Pennsylvania and Virginia to march on Washington.  (In fairness, Jefferson wasn't the first to think about going down this incredibly dangerous path - a couple years earlier, Hamilton had threatened to bring the troops assembled to theoretically protect the nation from Spain into Virginia to enforce the Sedition Act.)

If the Federalists in the Senate had conspired to place one of their own - John Marshall in particular - into office as acting President until December 1801 and had essentially overturned the election for a time, there's some evidence that the response might have been one that had a military component.  There were a couple different quasi-legal ways the Federalists could have accomplished this chicanery, and had Jefferson not insisted upon presiding over the Senate in person to prevent several bits of mischief from occurring it very well might have gone down.  But that's something I'll discuss later in a different question here that I've been meaning to get around to answering for a while....

629,AskHistorians,How did civil rights leaders like Malcolm X and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. make money?,"Unfortunately we don’t have full details on Martin Luther King Jr’s income. But due to some court cases, most notably a 1960 case on tax fraud, we’ve still got a *decent* idea of his income. He was acquitted on the fraud charges by an entirely white Alabama jury. 

His primary source of income was his salary for being a minister at Ebenezer Baptist Church. This varies by year but appears to have generally been about $6,000 per year, a fairly typical middle class income. According to the Census Bureau, mean income in 1960 was $5,600. By 1968 this had grown to around $8,000. But that’s still in line with the 1970 mean income of $9,870. So he was making a decent but not extravagant living as a minister. 

His salary for his position in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was set at $1 per year. Aside from his salaries he also received reimbursement for a lot of his civil rights work. So while he didn’t receive money for his travel, it also didn’t cost him anything. In addition to his minister’s salary, he also in theory got income for his 5 books he wrote and for prizes he received. But the money for the books, and things like his $54,000 Nobel Peace Prize cash award, was donated to groups like the SCLC. So in practice he limited himself to the income from his ministry position. This was largely what the 1960 fraud indictment centered on. But his personal journals proved to the jury’s satisfaction that he was indeed passing on his secondary incomes to charitable organizations.

His net worth at death was under $6,000 and his family had to rely on charity to get through the early years after his death. Although they’ve since made a lot more through the sale of memorabilia and the like.

I’ll leave Malcolm X to someone else, as I’m not terribly familiar with the details of his income."
630,AskHistorians,"Why do we call it “Latin” instead of naming it after the original nation like we do all others (Chinese=China, english=England), aka why don’t we call it “Roman”?","Latin is the name that the Romans themselves used for their language, which was the local Italic language/dialect that was spoken in the region of Latium, a collection of settlements in the lower Tiber valley. It was not the only Italic language; a Roman would have little difficulty conversing with a resident of, say, Tusculum or Lavinium, but would have more difficulty with other branches of Italic, as for instance the Oscan of the Samnites (an example being that the Latin ""quid"" for the interrogative ""what"" is instead rendered in Oscan as ""pid"" -- the relationship is visible but the languages are certainly different). Rome was one of the Latin cities, and became the predominant one (not always peacefully), with a victory over an alliance of Latin cities yielding Rome supremacy over the region from 338 BC. So, in that sense, insisting on calling the language ""Roman"" would be like insisting on calling English ""Londonish,"" although that isn't a particularly fair comparison since the ancient Romans had a concept of the city-state than the medieval English did not.

Interestingly, the term Latin was used by the Romans through the Republic and into the Empire for a sort of partial Roman citizenship; the ""Latin right"" or ""Latin citizenship"" described people and municipalities that possessed some, but not all, of the rights of Roman citizens, and the legal framework was extended to this conferring of partial citizenship to groups that had nothing to do with Latium, as for example a grant of the ius Latii to Spain by the emperor Vespasian, per Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia."
631,AskHistorians,"Why did certain religious folk just stop updating their fashion at a certain time? Hasidic Jews, The Pope, etc. When and why did their dress switch from contemporary to traditional?","I can speak to part of this (namely vestments in the Western Christian Church). 

In the early days of the Church, clerical dress was not noticeably different from what you might call upper-class streetwear. In *The Early Church*, Henry Chadwick relates that

> ...in the West the clergy did not wear distinct dress, even when officiating at services. In a remarkable letter of 428 Pope Celestine I rebuked clergy in southern Gaul for disturbing innovations in this respect. Western 'vestments' originated simply in the ordinary secular costume of antiquity, preserved by conservatism in churches after it had been abandoned elsewhere. (164)

So that is part of the answer. But why did this conservatism preserve them in churches but nowhere else? In part, the vestments began to acquire layers of spiritual/symbolic meaning, as related in *The New Altar Guild Book*:

> All three lines of liturgical wear [for bishops, priests, and deacons] have been adopted and adapted, added to and subtracted from, by clergy though subsequent centuries according to the customs and resources of their times and places. Although their ""daily wardrobe"" of the early years stayed the same, there is evidence that leaders reserved their ""best clothes"" for Sunday. They also set aside different sets of garments for different roles in the liturgy. When the clothing became ""vesture,"" it was progressively decorated with symbols, at first simply and then more elaborately--adding to the visual learning aids already developing in other church furnishings. When knowledge of the historical origin of the garments had faded from actual memory and become folklore, allegorical ideas and some religious meanings were thought of for many of them. (70)

Although the symbolic meanings for liturgical garments were not original to the garments, many throughout history have found them compelling. Moreover, clerical vestments serve as instant identifiers. If an ordained person is vested, those in the know can tell at a glance whether he is a bishop, priest, or deacon, and even whether he is Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, etc. Differences in styles of vestments or ways of wearing them can also signal one's allegiance to various liturgical parties within the Church -- for example, a ""high church"" Anglican priest will vest for the Eucharist in a chasuble, whereas a ""broad church"" priest might wear a cassock and surplice, and a ""low church"" priest just his clerical collar and a stole.  

Of course, clerical vesture has continued to change over the centuries and no doubt will continue to do so. Many churches do not use vestments. The move away from vesting in most of today's Protestant churches can be traced back to the Puritan movement in England in the 1600s. Stephen Neill writes, in his book *Anglicanism*,  that

> The Puritan was concerned for the prophetic ideal of holiness -- and exacting ethical code, and an adoring submission before the majesty of God. To him the wearing of the surplice was a bowing down in the house of Rimmon [Baal], an unworthy compromise with 'the mother of harlots' [i.e. those awful Catholics]. (143)

The Purtians preferred plain dress for their clerics, and in modern churches that trace their development from the Puritans there tends not to be any formal vesture for their clergy. A pastor may preach in a jacket and tie, for example, but the jacket and tie he wears to church will not be any different than the ones he might wear to the office. 

I suppose that this answer doesn't really cover the *when* of your questions, except to say gradually and a long time ago. But I hope that it has provided some insight into the *why* aspect.

632,AskHistorians,"George Orwell, an Englishman, once said that the ""rifle on the wall of the labourer’s cottage or working class flat is the symbol of democracy. It is our job to see that it stays there."" Was gun ownership once widespread among commoners in the UK, as in the US?","Gun ownership only really became a factor in Britain during the 16th century. Prior to that, a sort of ""right to bear arms"" did exist but this was rooted in the monarchy's desire to save money when raising armies. The idea was that every fighting man should possess weapons and armour befitting their social class that they can take to war (spears for peasants, suits of armour for knights, etc). Men who turned up without weapons had to be equipped at the monarchs own expense, which was not something they were eager to do. Armed peasants obviously created a threat of uprising against monarchs but this situation could be manipulated by local lords to their own benefit. Despite this, rebellions were common in British history and a constant concern.

The first real scare for the monarchy in relation to gun ownership was two high profile assassination of Protestant political figures by firearm during the reign of Elizabeth I. In a space of 13 years, the Regent of Scotland and the Prince of Orange were both assassinated by lone gun-men using a rifle and pistol respectively. Elizabeth I, as a major Protestant monarch, was wary of assassination by another Catholic gun-man so instituted the first ban of fire-arms (only near Royal palaces) and further laws in the 17th century focused on disarming Catholics while protecting gun ownership for Protestants.

Since fire-arms weren't widely manufactured or cheap to buy, common people didn't have much access to them. However, army regiments of the 17th century were often raised privately by wealthy land-owners, merchants and aristocrats for the monarchy (or against the monarchy in the civil wars). They would pay to import thousands of firearms left over from European wars to arm British regiments. Since they were technically all owned by this single individual and could be sold on, they weren't perceived as personally owned by each soldier and would attempt to disarm their own regiments. However, this didn't stop many soldiers from simply taking them home. Two additional factors made gun ownership even more common:

1. Mercenaries: Like every other European country of 17th century, Britain relied on mercenaries to bulk up their armies. Scotland in particular sent thousands of mercenaries to mainland Europe to fight in the religious wars there. As professional soldiers, they came home with their weapons and, more importantly, their experience, becoming a major factor in the British civil wars.
2. Standing armies: Cromwell's New Model Army was the first British standing army in the 1640s. These men became dedicated to a military life and were an active force across the entire British Isles for 15 years. Professional, permanently equipped soldiers like this became the core of the British military and the re-instated monarchy realised that their army was capable of dethroning them, ultimately handing over all control of it to parliament.

The Jacobite rebellions from in Scotland during the 17th and 18th century definitely benefited from a reserve of fire-arms personally owned by Scottish mercenaries and ex-soldiers, but this was marginal and completely inadequate to opposing the British army. Most of their weapons in later uprisings were provided by France or purchase personally by the Stuart pretenders. Each Jacobite uprising was followed by an effort to disarm the Scottish Highlands with the final Act of Proscription in 1746 being the most effective and brutal.

You can draw a direct link between soldiers returning from major wars and new firearm legislation. The Napoleonic Wars, WW1 and WW2 were each followed by Acts that sought to recover lost firearms and punish those using/found with them (I believe the American Civil War created a similar problem). However, these restrictions never fully outlawed gun-ownership and were usually trying to crack down on something else. 19th century politicians were more concerned about illegal poaching or using gun control as a means to generate revenue for the government through licences. Early 20th century gun control was trying to tackle more serious issues like organised crime or the smuggling of firearms into Ireland for use in the civil war or terrorism (a problem than continued into the 90s). However, some fairly disgusting acts of domestic terrorism using legal weapons (see Hungerford and Dunblane) in the late 20th century fully turned the country against the idea of wide-spread gun ownership. Amnesty programs recovered over 100,000 firearms in the 90s and the government spent millions compensating owners. There are still millions of legal firearms in the UK but they are strictly controlled.

However, George Orwell's quote is not referring to privately owned guns. It is often mis-quoted to push a gun-ownership position to people who respect his politics and work. Orwell is actually referring to rifles in the homes of men enlisted in the Home Guard, which was a citizens militia established by the British Army as a last line of defence in case of an invasion of Britain by the Axis powers. It was made up of men who were too old, young or otherwise ineligible to join the Army, it even enlisted women mid-way through WW2. They were trained by the Army to defend key locations in the event of invasion and were armed with whatever the British Army did not want/need, leaving them badly equipped for much of WW2. Orwell was commenting on the nature of citizen militia's in totalitarian states like Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, claiming that they could not establish something like the Home Guard as it could only exist in a free democracy. He is suggesting that a totalitarian government would not trust the working man to own a gun in case they rose up against them. Unfortunately that is a very utopian idea which doesn't fit with the fact that the Nazi party actually loosened gun laws and instituted many programs similar to the Home Guard that handed out weapons to civilians (see Volksstrum). The quote was from a newspaper article in 1941, so Orwell's intention was probably to defend the Home Guard and encourage working people to join, he probably wasn't fully-aware of the similar institutions in Nazi Germany. Orwell's advocacy of gun-ownership also fits more with the Swiss model of mandatory military service rather than a defence of private, individual ownership which is the common debate in the US."
633,AskHistorians,"I'm the wife of a slaveowner in the southern US in the 1850s. If my husband decided to have his way with a female slave, would I consider it cheating/adultery?","Edit: I know it is tacky to acknowledge the gilding of your own post and all, but while first off ""Thanks!"", I have a bazillion years of Reddit Premium already and don't need more, so if anyone else is feeling that impulse, please instead consider making a donation of that amount to a charity that helps sexual assault survivors. The below might be history but it also isn't in too many ways. Thanks. (Edit II: I'd recommend RAINN or Children of the Night)

--------

The sum is that you would likely turn a blind eye and pretend that your husband wasn't routinely raping the enslaved women that he owned, and deny to yourself the strong resemblance that many of the lighter skinned black persons on the plantation might have to your spouse. It would be known, of course. Gossip existed, but the diarist Mary Chestnut famously summarized it that ""*any lady is ready to tell you who is the father of all the mulatto children in everybody's household but her own.""*

In more detail, of course, I have written about the broader topic before, which further touches on several aspects of your question, as well as other issues of the treatment of enslaved persons, which I'll repost here:

Before we continue, a word on definitions. Rape is a term that can be applied to essentially any sexual relationship between an enslaved person and their master. The practical forms which master-slave sexual relations took ran the gamut from brutal and forced submission to 'real' relationships, but it cannot be separated from the framework in which they occurred, namely the actual legal ownership of the enslaved woman and rights to her body. No matter how willfully a slave-woman (or man) acquiesced to a sexual relationship, their consent within that framework cannot be entirely separated from the fact that the consent was not required, and was given with that understanding. It is a balancing act, really, as we both don't want to *overlook* the systemic framework in which the sexual relationship occured, but as the same time in looking at it broadly, we musn't *deny* the agency of some slave women who, within that framework, nevertheless did at times have some choice, however limited. Put another way, if asked ""Was it always rape?"" the answer is ""Yes, but no, but yes"": The power-dynamic intrinsically places it within that framework; but we shouldn't deny the women agency; but we then shouldn't overcorrect and let that agency trump the fact that they had no choice to be within the system which gave them the limited choices they did have. On a macro level, yes, it was always rape, but that shouldn't stop us from seeking to understand the intricacies and realities of the actual lived experiences of those enslaved women (and men).


 As you bring up Jefferson-Hemings, this is worth mentioning as it is a good example of the complicated nature that these relationships could reach, although it is also something of an outlier. Annette Gordon-Reed's work on Sally and the Hemings family in ""The Hemingses of Monticello"" is an excellent work that spends a good deal of time exploring the relationship, and more importantly exploring Sally's side. 

Sally though, had far more opportunity than almost any other enslaved woman who found herself the object of the master's sexual advances. She was rather unique in being in France with the Jefferson family at the beginning of the relationship, which meant that technically under French law, she was free and could have certainly succeeded in a petition for it to the French authorities. Although she herself left nothing on the subject, but their son Madison, long after booth his parent's deaths, related what the understanding had been under which she agreed to return to Virginia:

>But during that time my mother became Mr. Jefferson’s concubine, and when he was called back home she was [enciente](https://www.dictionary.com/wordoftheday/2015/08/30/enceinte) by him. He desired to bring my mother back to Virginia with him, but she demurred. She was just beginning to understand the French language well, and in France she was free, while if she returned to Virginia she would be reenslaved. So she refused to return with him. To induce her to do so he promised her extraordinary privileges, and made a solemn pledge that her children should be freed at the age of twenty-one years. In consequence of his promises, on which she implicitly relied, she returned with him to Virginia.

So in short, she was in an incredibly unique position to have actual leverage. Gordon-Reed spends a good deal of time exploring the complications of this relationship, and I won't really dwell further on it other than to say that Jefferson mostly kept his word, but the relationship is so *unrepresentative* of the general circumstances we see in the south sexual relationships between slaver and enslaved, that it really ought not be the focus, even if it can't be avoided simply due to its fame and prominence.

Practically speaking, the extent of enforced, legal protections that a slave woman had against sexual abuse essentially related to the damages that she might sustain if raped by someone else, in which case, of course, the offense was against her owner, not herself. It is of course supremely ironic, that in this situation whether or not the black woman consented had no bearing. The offender had violated the master's property rights, and severe sentences were common. There were some laws concerning 'miscegenation' which in theory could see a white man in legal trouble (but not for the rape part), but their enforcement was never common, and unheard if by the antebellum period. I say all of this because while relationships described may not always be violent, they absolutely must be understood within that context, and I don't want it forgotten with the following. It was a constant threat that slave women lived with over their heads, whether manifested or not. Linda Brent, a slave woman (and pseudonym for the writer Harriet Jacobs), sums up these fears well when describing how she ""entered on my fifteenth year—a sad epoch in the life of a slave girl"":

>there is no shadow of law to protect her from insult, from violence, or even from death; all these are inflicted by fiends who bear the shape of men. [The slave girl is] prematurely knowing in evil things. Soon she will learn to tremble when she hears her master’s footfall. She will be compelled to realize that she is no longer a child. If God has bestowed beauty upon her, it will prove her greatest curse. That which commands admiration in the white woman only hastens the degradation of the female slave.

Now, as to the matter of masters (and younger male family members, and overseers) and their sexual relations with enslaved women in the antebellum South, it was fairly common. There was a decided view of the black woman as being naturally promiscuous and sexual (compared to the belief in white women being chaste and demure) which only helped to encourage the behavior. But although it was a common occurrence, it was *definitely* not something talked about in polite company, and *doubly* not around women, although they often knew what was going on - speaking of the sexual relations that the menfolk took, the famed diarist Mary Chesnut wrote of black women that ""we live surrounded by prostitutes"". It was essentially something that most of white society would just pretend didn't happen, no matter what the evidence, of which it often could be fairly clear, as recalled by one slave:

>[Master] used to have some Irishmen on the plantation, and he said these children were theirs, but everybody knew they were his. They were as much like him as himself.

Another example relates a master who accused his childrens' tutor of fathering the biracial child of a female slave on the plantation and dismissed the young man, although many believed the master himself to be the father and simply using it as a 'cover'. No one, of course, would call the man on it though. And the slaves themselves wouldn't dare even acknowledge it among themselves but in secret, as to do so could result in severe punishment.

Jacobs' time with her master, Dr. Flint, was punctuated not only by his advances towards her, but to others women enslaved in his household. At least one black woman bore his child, likely unwillingly, and when her own spouse raised the issue of the lightened skin of their son during an argument within earshot of an overseer, they both suffered for it, being sold off in short order for speaking what was expected to remain quiet. While many followed the strictures laid out by Chestnut, some white mistresses, as in the case of Jacobs', were quietly jealous, but they had few ways to vent their anger, which might simply manifest itself in worse treatment of the women that they suspected to be the object of their husbands' attentions - caring little how *wanted* those attentions might be. Jacobs, at least, was fortunate enough in that her jealous mistress worked to prevent Dr. Flint from acting on his licentious thoughts, but not out of a sense of moral uprightness, so much as her jealousy. In rare cases, the most moral of women might attempt to convince their husbands to free their literal children, but as Jacobs noted, ""bad institution deadens the moral sense, even in white women, to a fearful extent"".

As I already noted, it wasn't criminally rape to literally rape your slaves, so the law presented no impediment to a licentious master, and the only real protections were thus unreliable at best, such as Jacobs', who was saved not by grace but by jealousy. The threat of community censure also could provide some protection, but limited at best, since it was generally only ""concerning"" if a master flaunted the relationship, as opposed to keeping it quiet, and even then, it was no guarantee the community wouldn't willfully turn a blind eye. Bertram Wyatt-Brown sums up the so called 'rules' that were to be followed thusly:"
634,AskHistorians,"Korean food is notoriously spicy, which is a bit out of place considering its cold climate and the fact that its neighbors in (northern) China and Japan don't eat nearly as much spicy food. Why and how did Korean cuisine specifically get so spicy?","Nobody knows for sure why Korean food is so spicy. The *how* is a bit clearer, and it turns out to be yet another side effect of the Colombian Exchange.

The introduction of the Mexican chili pepper (*Capsicum annuum*) in the seventeenth century was revolutionary for Korean cuisine, which does not seem to have been particularly spicier than North Chinese fare before the Early Modern period. Take kimchi, for example. The best-known kimchi we all know and love (to hate) is basically fermented cabbage spiced with pepper. But the broader sense of *kimch'i*  is *any* fermented vegetable, and the spicy cabbage kimchi simply did not exist before the eighteenth century at the earliest. Among the earliest records of Korean *kimch'i* (*Collected Works of Minister Yi of the Eastern Land*, published in 1241) mentions the dish as ""salt-fermented radish, a thing to last the winter."" 

Korea's first cookbook – *Records for Mountain Houses* – was written in 1459. It enumerates thirty-eight types of *kimch'i*, including such exotic dishes as fermented eggplant, fermented ginger, and fermented taro root, but few if any of them would be spicy in the way we imagine Korean cuisine to be. Korean *sauerkraut* would be a far better analogy than modern kimchi. At the time of the *Records*, Korean spices were principally black pepper, ginger, leeks, and Sichuan peppers, and even those were used rather sparingly.^1

Then, beginning in the seventeenth century, the chili pepper was introduced. It probably came from Europeans via Japan, and a 1614 encyclopedia already refers to chili pepper (which is variously called ""Southern Barbarian plant"" or ""Japanese mustard""):

> The Southern Barbarian Plant [*Namman ch'o*] is toxic. They mix it with *[soju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soju)* [distilled liquor] in the taverns [to make the alcohol seem stronger] and those who died of drinking it are not few.

A little like the reception potatoes first had in Europe, the chili pepper seems to have been generally distrusted in Korea.

But over the course of the seventeenth century, and for disputed reasons, chili peppers became *the* condiment of choice throughout the Korean peninsula. The first mention of peppered *kimch'i* comes from *Revised Farm Management*, a 1766 agricultural manual that discusses how cucumbers should be stuffed with powdered pepper and fermented to make *kimch'i*. *Management* is also the first surviving text to discuss pepper paste and pepper powder, the two condiments by far the most responsible for Korean food being hot, in detail.

By the time *Management* was written, chili pepper appears to already have been a popular spice among both the elite and at least the urbanites of Seoul. In the *Diaries of the Royal Secretariat* (an account of court proceedings by the King of Korea's secretaries) entry for September 5, 1749, the king says:^2

> Nowadays I am fond of pungent food, such as Sichuan peppers and chili paste.

And from the May 23, 1752 *Diaries* entry:^2

> His Majesty said, ""Pepper paste is something newly made in recent days, and had it existed earlier, I should certainly have eaten it then."" [Kim] Sŏnhaeng [tutor of the Crown Prince] said, ""And now the common people outside the palace gates are making it.""

By the early nineteenth century, all records are clear that pepper is an extremely widespread condiment among all social classes in Korea.

The question is why, of course. One theory is that the [Little Ice Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age), a period of unusually cold weather, disrupted salt production. We do know that the Little Ice Age was devastating for Korea, resulting in major crop failures and famines in 1670-1671, 1695-1699, 1708, 1728-1729, 1731-1732, and 1750, each killing as many as several hundreds of thousands. The unusual climatic conditions might have been conducive for pepper, mistrusted as it was, to become popular as a replacement for salt before establishing an ever-growing niche in Korean cuisine in its own right.

Another point to note is that no other Colombian Exchange crop, except tobacco, has become as influential in Korea as chili peppers. But perhaps this isn't so surprising. While tobacco probably predated chili peppers, other American crops came much later and had much less opportunity to carve out a niche other than famine food. Corn is first mentioned in the aforementioned *Revised Farm Management* and probably arrived sometime in the eighteenth century, sweet potatoes came from Japan in 1763, and potatoes came from China in the 1820s.^3

635,AskHistorians,Did people in the middle ages ever ACTUALLY plan battles using miniatures on top of a big table map?,"No.

In Classical Greece, my area of expertise, this certainly did not happen. I'm not as qualified to speak on other premodern eras or regions. But I think there's pretty good reason to assume that the large boardgame-like battle map wasn't actually used by any armed force anywhere until the mid-to-late 19th century. 

The first and most obvious point is that detailed maps of this kind didn't exist. Of course, map making goes back at least to the Late Archaic Greeks, but these maps were only rough visualisations of geographical knowledge. It took many centuries for trigonometry and other relevant fields of mathematics to develop to the point where accurate representations of 3-dimensional space on a 2-dimensional plane were even feasible.

Now, you might say that this is irrelevant because there's no need for an *accurate* map when planning broad strategical manoeuvres. An outline of the country and its cities and geographical features will do. But that's putting the cart before the horse. The point is that it wasn't until militaries realised their need of good maps that they started making such maps. This is what drove the development of detailed map making in the first place. The reason people in Antiquity didn't have maps like ours is because their commanders *did not see the need for such maps.*

It can be hard for us to wrap our heads around this. We modern people learn to think of space in terms of maps. We visualise everything from countries to transportation networks to buildings in a top-down, schematic manner. We are accustomed to situating ourselves in space by coordinates on a flat grid. We learn to understand notions like compass points, scale, and legend. When we play strategy games, we take it for granted that there will be a geographical map and a strategic map and a battle minimap and whatever else - visual aides that allow us to understand where we are and what's going on. But this is because in our day, such maps are widely available. Universal digital maps have replaced partial physical maps; we are the first generation of humans that can see exactly where we are on the globe anywhere at any time. People in Antiquity did not have such tools. Unsurprisingly, they thought of space very differently.

When you read accounts of Greek military campaigns, and accounts of Greek generals debating strategy and tactics, you'll never find a single reference to a map. Instead, space is conceptualised as a number of known routes from one location to another; as a succession of conjoined territories occupied by different peoples; as a number of days' marching or sailing; as the area around notable features, like mountains, rivers, cities or sanctuaries; and as ground where an army can or cannot pass or deploy for battle. In other words, space is not defined in terms of abstract schematics, but in terms of observed reality and relevant knowledge. If a Greek general needed information about terrain, he would seek out a local guide. If he needed to plan a campaign, he would rely on common knowledge about the distance to the target and the roads one took to get there. 

I'll show you how this works. Herodotos describes how the tyrant Aristagoras tried to convince the Spartan king Kleomenes to support his rebellion against Persia in 499 BC. This scene is the only time in Greek history that a map is used to support war planning. But it doesn't go as we'd expect:

> ""The lands in which they dwell lie next to each other, as I shall show: next to the Ionians are the Lydians, who inhabit a good land and have great store of silver."" This he said, pointing to the map of the earth which he had brought engraved on the tablet. ""Next to the Lydians,"" said Aristagoras, ""you see the Phrygians to the east, men that of all known to me are the richest in flocks and in the fruits of the earth..."" [he goes on to describe one people after another]

> Kleomenes asked Aristagoras how many days' journey it was from the Ionian sea to the king [of Persia]. Till now, Aristagoras had been cunning and fooled the Spartan well, but here he made a false step. If he desired to take the Spartans away into Asia he should never have told the truth. But he did tell it, and said that it was a three months' journey inland. 

> At that, Kleomenes cut short Aristagoras' account of the prospective journey. He then bade his Milesian guest depart from Sparta before sunset, for never, he said, would the Lakedaimonians listen to the plan, if Aristagoras desired to lead them a three months' journey from the sea.

-- Hdt. 5.49-50

First, Kleomenes clearly struggles with the concept of a map, and Aristagoras effectively translates the image into ethnographical  information that will make sense to him. Second, Kleomenes does not independently grasp the scale of what he's seeing, and needs that translated as well. Once he is told what the map really means - once it is reduced to the key information on which he would base his own war planning - he immediately dismisses Aristagoras and abandons the Greeks of Asia to their fate.

We can speculate how useful detailed maps would have been to the Greeks in their many wars, and how much easier a well-informed strategist and tactician would have found it to wage their campaigns. But the point is that, to them, it was not needed. They knew the land, and if they didn't they would explore it on the spot or simply ask someone about it. All they needed to know was easily conveyed by word of mouth and didn't need to be complicated by abstraction and projection. Why would they develop sophisticated map making techniques, or ponder large map tables as they considered their plan for the next campaign?

Most commanders throughout premodern history will have agreed with Herodotos that maps, in all their abstraction and distortion, can decieve as easily as they can inform. They would argue that maps may be useful in navigation, and in the visualisation of ideal geographies or past events, but that they are not the most efficient way to convey the critical information needed to wage war. So where does the notion of the big tactical and strategic map come from?

This may be only a partial explanation, but a key driver of military map making in Europe was the sense of Napoleon's enemies that they had been beaten by superior knowledge, and that the only way to prevent such humiliation was to take preparation for future wars seriously. This had never been done at any scale on an institutional level. In Prussia, the establishment of the Great General Staff in 1824 triggered the first wave of government-sanctioned mapping for the use of the military; in the course of the 19th century, Prussian map makers became leaders in the production of high-quality, accurate maps for both tactical and strategic purposes. As other European powers followed their lead, all of Europe was mapped out in meticulous detail for the first time. Most of the maps used today are still built on the results of this military initiative.

The war exercises of the Great General Staff focused heavily on the use of maps for the gathering of information, the weighing of possibilities and the giving of orders. The first thing you did as a participant of such exercises was receive and take stock of your maps. At the same time, efforts to train officers in different ways also spurred the development of war games more similar to modern board games like *Risk*, with tokens in different colours moved around stylised maps and encounters resolved by dice rolls. As the Prussian victories of 1864-1871 cemented the status of their staff as the most effective military organisation in the world (deserved or otherwise), other powers made it their business to learn from Prussian ways, and this probably did a lot to solidify the idea that proper military training involved abstracting tactical problems into maps and tokens, and proper military planning was done around big, detailed, carefully compiled tactical and strategic maps.

The large map has become such a fixture of battle planning scenes in war movies (based on real map rooms and map tables like the ones still visible in the [Cabinet War Rooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_War_Rooms#/media/File:MapRoomCabinetWarRoomsTrim.jpg) and the [Battle of Britain bunker](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Plotting_Table.jpg/1200px-Plotting_Table.jpg) in London) that we now *expect* maps and tokens to be there, even if the story is set as far back as Antiquity. We struggle to imagine another way for a council of commanders to survey the situation and decide on a plan. It gives a delightful visualisation of the setup as it is explained to the viewer, and it allows characters to pore over maps brooding, which is how we imagine the tactical mastermind. *Game of Thrones* is a particularly serious offender, with large strategic maps appearing as decorative furniture in Dragonstone, as a floor mosaic in King's Landing, and as a tabletop game in Winterfell. 

But none of this is even slightly historical. The peoples of the time period that inspired *Game of Thrones* did not have such maps, or the way of thinking about tactics and strategy that would have produced them. We are just projecting what we've come to think of as normal into an imagined past."

637,AskHistorians,"The Mongol Empire was much more recent than Rome; why do we know so much less about it? Was there a difference in how literate the societies were, did the Mongols prize secrecy, am I betraying western biases, or is it something else?","Would you settle for...*a combination of factors*?

;)

You're right, though--the Mongols are one of those areas of history where popular interest significantly outpaces research. We can find contributing factors in the primary source record, the practicalities of archaeology, the state of secondary scholarship, and the long stranglehold of ""classical"" education and adulation in the West.

I'm going to write this from a western, primarily Anglophone perspective, although it will become clear that the specifically Western factors involved affect Near Eastern and Asian scholars as well.

In terms of primary sources: internal to the Mongols, the source record is extremely weak and late. The oldest surviving textual source, known today under the excellent title *The Secret History of the Mongols*, was written sometime after 1228. Even then, our copy is in Middle Mongolian, but recorded in and for a Chinese context in the early 14th century. Igor de Rachewitz argued in 1965 that the *Secret History* was an original for the Mongols, not just the sole survivor. Genghis Khan had ordered the adoption of Uighur script for the writing of the Mongolian language, reinforcing our understanding of earlier Mongol illiteracy; the text itself seems to be a collection of oral genres mashed together rather than reflecting any established written genre from surrounding civilizations--and definitely not reflecting the internal historiography that Mongols under the Yuan dynasty would produce.

Later on, even with Kublai Khan's advisors convincing him that the history of the Mongols starting from Genghis' sons needed to be written (the *Secret History* covered to that point), the segmented Mongol Empire had entire swathes that just...shunned an internal historiography. Thus, even with the Mongols developing an elite literate class within the Golden Horde or the Chagatai Khanate, they seem to have preferred to maintain *oral* histories rather than written ones.

The other body of Mongol Empire writing that survives is diplomatic letters especially to the West, which exist in Latin translation. But the utility of this corpus for informing us about the Mongols themselves is limited by its purpose, especially since Latin Europe had a vested interest in seeing the Mongols as potential converts to Christianity and allies against Muslims.

Then there are the external written sources from the people who interacted with and reacted to the Mongols. There are lots of these!

...And they are written in medieval versions of Chinese, Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Russian, Armenian, Georgian, Old French, Italian, and Latin.

To really get a grip on the Mongols, a scholar would need a handle on a rather breathtaking number of languages, *or* access to reliable translations. This is why ""how the West reacted to the Mongols"", as Peter Jackson points out, has been a rather popular line of scholarship since the 1820s...in the West.

Which leads us to the secondary scholarship problem: it's dispersed among even more languages than the primary sources. Bits and pieces of analysis of the Mongol Empire have absolutely been done! Are ongoing! And often impossible to access for the majority of scholars.

Archaeology, which is ever more important even to historical fields with a strong textual record, poses challenges for tackling the Mongol Empire as well. The Empire was *big*, y'all. There's not as much ""knowing where to look"" as there is when, say, walking through Rome. And much of the space the Empire held--including actively held, with outposts and castles--is not very densely populated today. So in England, for example, you've got another medieval village discovered when the city goes to build a parking lot or an apartment building. That kind of serendipity is less likely to occur for archaeologists searching out Mongol material culture.

And finally for present purposes, I'll talk about the overarching, many-tentacled influence of the Western inheritance of classical (Greco-Roman) culture. I was originally going to make a joke about how if you're comparing density of historical scholarship on a subject, ancient Rome is about as useful a metric as the tanks of World War II. But the fact is--that is *not* a given, that is an active, ongoing choice of European/American historiography. Even with ""barbarian"" appropriation and alteration of *Romanitas* in the early Middle Ages, ""Rome"" as an idea held a certain allure, a prestige that everyone wanted to tie their own polities into. In the 14th century, early humanist writers lament how the world has fallen into a dark age *since the high point of Rome*; the Renaissance of the 15th-16th centuries was a group of white men wanting to *bring back Rome*. Rome has been at the center of historiography and the west in more ways than just the immense debt we owe to Edward Gibbon--the whole idea of ""western civilization"" derives from a culture repossession of 'classical' heritage. Into the 20th century, learning Latin and Greek was the basics of an advanced education; ""classics"" is not only its own field of study, but monopolizes the label ""Classic"" for Greece and Rome above the classical traditions of every other society on the planet.

So for Westerners, learning Latin and Greek in the course of a formal education was for so long a necessity because of our belief in the importance of classical heritage...but that also made it much easier to study Greece and Rome because people could read the sources!

And the linguistic imperialism of the west continues today with the surpassing importance of English in historiography. Historians trained in western graduate schools must know English, French, German, and then (or possibly substituting for French/German) the languages relevant to their own research. What if we required historians to learn Arabic or Farsi and Chinese or Japanese, and then allowed the *substition* of French or German for one if their research demanded it?

In the case of Mongol research, that would connect Anglophone scholars with the scholarly community that *doesn't* produce writing in English, French, or German. It would provide a basis for tackling a body of sources that is immense when you combine languages.

And it is almost definitely not going to happen. What I said above about how Europeans, and European-descended North America, viewing Greece and Rome as the ""foundation of western civilization"" since, well, since Greece and Rome? This invents a continuity, a line from them to us (I am American) today, which has major ramifications for scholars having to defend our existence as scholars, not just the conclusion of our research. There are, they say, two reasons to study the Middle Ages (slash Renaissance slash European history etc). One, because it's the foundations of the *modern* world and lets us see how we got here today. Two, because the Middle Ages are f*cking weird. 

If you take a sweeping, people-focused historical approach, as history academia to its credit is starting to/trying to do, you absolutely find the ""foundations of western civilization"" in a web *with* other civilizations; it's not a story that can be told in isolation. But the mainstream idea of ""foundations"" tends to be intellectual, scientific, probably less so religious today. Lawyers drop Latin terms into everyday prose because the roots of our legal traditions are Roman; you're reading this in a font that derives from the 15th-16th century humanists believing that the Carolingian miniscule handwriting their classical sources were written in was actually Roman handwriting.

So ultimately, it's easy to say ""the Mongols didn't write much."" It's easy to say, ""the Mongols are hard to find in the dirt."" But look--the Mongols are a medieval civilization, and if there is anything medievalists do better than you, it is drawing entire books and decades-long scholarly controversies out of the doodle marks in the margins of one manuscript, or the discovery of a single coin. 

We absolutely could do better. But long, long patterns of Western cultural chauvinism have shaped a scholarly environment where research on the Mongols is compartmentalized in isolated linguistic/geographic communities. And we're a long ways from fully reconciling those divides."

639,AskHistorians,"How do I join a trebuchet crew in late medieval France? Is it a family thing, are there interviews? What are some of the risks and benefits of my new career that are maybe less known?","**Part 1 - Context**

The source material for late medieval France specifically is a little sparse, but there wasn't anything particularly special about France compared to its neighbours so I hope you don't mind me using evidence from places other than France. The reason this question has taken so long for anyone to answer is that the source material needed to answer these questions are sparse and difficult. People writing in the Middle Ages cared about kings and feats of valour; when a trebuchet is demolishing a castle wall, no source cares to record the long chain of events that brought said trebuchet to that moment. The *best* we’ve got in terms of sources are financial records, mostly English, which record these people being paid. Imagine trying to work out say… the life and background of a modern pilot based only on the quarterly reports of American Airlines, but where most of said reports were damaged in a fire. So it’s best to see this answer as “Here is how I think it worked based on extremely fragmentary sources that are insufficient but it’s all we’ve got so I might be wrong about some things” rather than “Here’s how it worked, bask in my genius.”

An important thing to note about this question is that there were generally two groups of people who would be part of a trebuchet crew. The first were just rank and file soldiers, or local labourers, who were told to build and operate the machine. They provided the basic manual labour. The answers to your questions for this group are very simple: they volunteered or were ordered to do it, no vetting process required beyond 'can you use a hammer?'. The main downside was that your own machine might malfunction and kill/maim you, the main upside was bonus pay and avoiding the front lines, though the enemy's archers and artillery would've been doing their best to kill you.

The second group of people, who I suspect are the people you're more interested in, were specialised carpenters and engineers who designed the trebuchet, constructed the most complicated aspects of its design, supervised and directed the labourers, and sometimes aimed it using maths. They usually also had the job of repairing the wall they just knocked down after the castle or town was taken.

I also think a bit of context the logistics of western medieval trebuchets might be helpful. From the 13th century, it was increasingly common for trebuchets to be flat-pack. That is to say, the components were assembled before the campaign and then brought along to an enemy castle or town in wagons. They were then assembled by a team of carpenters and labourers. This innovation made them quicker to build, easier to transport, reusable across multiple sieges, and allowed for standardised designs that could be produced in bulk. The flat-pack trebuchet seems to have been an innovation of Richard I's engineers for the Third Crusade. Richard anticipated sieges but also knew that the Holy Land did not have sufficient forests with sufficiently strong wood to support ad hoc trebuchet and catapult construction. Richard decided to bring two massive trebuchets with him, but they needed to fit on the ships Richard was using to ferry his army to the Holy Land, which forced the innovation of a compact transport solution. By the later Middle Ages it was commonplace for armies to travel with wagons full of trebuchet parts.

This means that a trebuchet crew actually had two sides to it. There were the people who operated the machine in the field, and the people who originally built it. For the purposes of answering the question, I'm going to call that first group the 'field team' and the second the 'design team'. They would often overlap, especially for non-standard machines where the carpenters who built it might be paid to come on campaign and supervise their machine themselves.

Was this a tradition that postdated the invention of coinage, or an existing tradition adapted to include coinage?","The first literary reference to the custom of providing the dead with coins for Charon's ferry appears in Aristophanes' *Frogs* (405 BC), when Dionysus pays Charon two obols (one for him and one for his slave) to cross over the Acheron. To judge from Athenian tomb assemblages, however, the custom only became widespread in the following century, and was never universal. The coins, moreover, seem to have only sometimes been inserted into the mouth; nearly as often, they were just left beside the body. Although an obol (a modest fee, equal to about a sixth of a skilled workman's daily wage) seems to have standard, some burials have thin gold medals (bracteates) instead.

It is difficult to discern how the custom emerged. Charon, not attested in Homer or the early Greek poets, is first named in literature of the early fifth century BC (or slightly before, in the early epic *Minyas*). This does not, of course, mean that Charon was ""invented"" around this time, but it does suggest that he wasn't especially prominent in popular belief before the classical period. Why he became more prominent then is impossible to say. Diodorus Siculus, writing in the first century BC, claimed that Charon was imported from Egypt by the mythical Orpheus (1.92). Whatever his origins, it may be that the Athenian tragedians and comedians, who often made reference to the ferryman and even (as in the case of Aristophanes' Frogs) brought him onstage, made Charon a more prominent part of the Athenian imagination.

The habit of putting Charon's fare in the mouths of the dead is easier to trace. Lacking pockets, the Athenians often carried small coins in their mouths when they were going to the market. Transferring this custom to the dead was a natural leap.

Edit: u/rosemary86 has called Charon's appearance in *Minyas* to my attention, and pointed out that many references to the practice of putting an obol in the mouth of the dead mock the practice, which suggests that it was often viewed as an idle superstition."
641,AskHistorians,"Mexico used to be a very militaristic nation just 100 years ago, most people had guns and soldiers were idolized in the media, but now almost no mexican knows how to shoot a gun, and soldiers are almost absent in all local media, how and why did this happen?","So to preface, I don't *know* the answer, and in some ways I would ponder the accuracy of the premise but as this has been sitting unanswered for a time now, and I do at least have a sense of where to look, I thought I would offer you some pointers. 

Your question really plays into three related, but also independent, factors, namely the popular image of the Revolution, shifting ideas of Mexican masculinity, and the conception and image of violence in Mexican society. My own interests to this topic is tangential at best and ends with the Revolution, finding the conflict itself fascinating, but also attracted to the late 19th to early 20th century due to the expression of elite violence in the form of the duel and honor disputes in Mexican political society of the period. It is definitely related, as I *can* speak to the use, and threat, of violence was used as part of the construction of masculinity for Mexican elites in the fin-de-siècle, which absolutely forms part of the foundation here, I just can't speak to the latter 20th century and the shift. *But*, I can recommend you some excellent books that tackle the three themes I highlighted above, some singularly, but also in conjunction with each other!

* *The Tyranny of Opinion: Honor in the Construction of the Mexican Public Sphere* by Pablo Piccato: This is going to be background, as it focuses on the late 19th century, but it is an absolutely invaluable book for *me* in its focus on elite masculinities and violence in Porfirian Mexican society. Highly recommend it just generally!

* *Violence, Coercion, and State-Making in Twentieth-Century Mexico: The Other Half of the Centaur* edited by Wil G. Pansters: This is an edited collection with a wide array of essays covering different aspects of, well, exactly what it says on the cover. Several I think would be relevant here, and I'd specifically highlight the essay ""Policing and Regime Transition"", as it speaks to all three of the themes at points as I recall.

* *Cinemachismo: Masculinities and Sexuality in Mexican Film* by Sergio de la Mora: This looks at popular presentation of Mexican masculinity in film, including (but hardly limited to!) the Revolution. I would pair this with *Constructing the Image of the Mexican Revolution: Cinema and the Archive* by Zuzana M. Pick, which obviously looks much deeper specifically at the Revolution, but as I recall doesn't focus too much on masculinity.

* *Modernity and the Nation in Mexican Representations of Masculinity: From Sensuality to Bloodshed* by H. Domínguez-Ruvalcaba: This is most squarely just looking at masculinity, and the final chapter focuses on violence.

* *Modernity at Gunpoint: Firearms, Politics, and Culture in Mexico and Central America* by Sophie Esch: I think this one might be the best for you if you can find it. Haven't read it myself, but found it checking to see if I had my bases covered, and it only just came out last year! I did give it a quick skim, as I was thinking *maybe* it would have the answer front and center to write up something proper, but I think it will be too nuances to really answer without a deep read, but based on glancing through, it definitely has several chapters which I think will be of interest here, so couldn't not make mention of it.

Again, none of this is a clear answer, but I think it should offer some useful avenues for investigation to trace the threads necessary to construct one. Hope that helps!"
642,AskHistorians,"Did people cut spices with something to add weight, like they do with drugs today?","Medieval Europeans had a few go-to ways to defraud spice buyers, especially when it came to the use of spice as medicine. And they were eager practitioners--a little *too* eager. In fifteenth-century England alone, multiple doctors and apothecaries were executed for counterfeiting coins as well. (All in a day's work, I suppose.)

Spice fraudsters had a few go-to tricks, accounting for the use of spices as both medicine and flavoring:

* Sell something that wasn't the claimed spice at all

* Invent a new kind of spice (""St. Paul's grace"" is my favorite)

* Sell impure spices by weight, although this became less a fraud and more just something you dealt with

* Mix in stuff to add weight--often just adding water (sorry, I know that's kinda dull)

* Mix in sand or sawdust. Bakers even did this to sell *bread* by weight! Mixing in cobwebs was another bakers' trick, which, ew.

Unsurprisingly, medieval literature satirized fraudsters; medieval apothecaries complained bitterly about them and accused every medical practitioner who wasn't an apothecary of being such a fraudster; and medieval merchants spent a good bit of time trying to come up with ways to thwart fraudsters.

Pharmaceutical guides like the [*Liber de simplici medicina*](http://blog.wellcomelibrary.org/2017/02/a-medieval-medical-bestseller-the-circa-instans/) (usually known as the *Circa instans*), a 12th century guide to medical recipes and such, often covered some ways to detect fraud. This is one area where the substance in question being a spice could help, because they *generally* have taste. (Tutty is chimney scrapings and ambergis is dried whale vomit, more or less, so remember that tasting *good* is not necessarily the idea.)

As far as selling spices in a 'raw' or impure state--you know ""garbled speech""? (I am, um, *fairly certain* that you are aware of garbled speech right now.) A ""garbler"" in late medieval England was someone responsible for sorting out impurities. (I have no idea what that actually entailed, sorry. I just read about this stuff.)

But my favorite stories are the invented spices, and my favorite inventors are the *pauliani* of 15C-16C Italy.

Which is to say:

*Renaissance snake-handlers.*

The *pauliani* would arrive at the gates of a city, with a banner displaying a snake and...well, at least one big bad snake with them. And they (the pauliani, not the snakes, although you could draw some metaphors here) were good enough at convincing people to buy their snakebite cure--""St. Paul's grace""--to make the *pauliani* A Thing that a whole lot of writers liked to complain about.

I realize that Just Add Water is not quite the exciting answer you were looking for in terms of cutting spices. But hopefully snake-handling can make up for that, a bit.

643,AskHistorians,"In the US currently, the wealthiest 1% control 38% of wealth. A record high. What did the wealth distribution look like in other periods?","Eighteenth-century British North America isn't one of the three places you identified, but I suspect this will be interesting to you and others.

To understand wealth in eighteenth-century America, historians often use tax lists. Their study of them hasn't been comprehensive, but has in many cases focused on large port cities (which aren't necessarily representative of the rest of the continent). These tax lists are a bit quirky. They weren't produced every year, or even every decade. Only a few have survived. They don't necessarily account for all of an individual's wealth, because some folks were very good at hiding wealth from tax assessors. Moreover, they tend to only count heads of household or individuals with property (usually white men, sometimes widows, never enslaved people). 

With those limitations in mind, what historians have found is that if you divide these tax lists into brackets, those at the top did own an extremely high proportion of the wealth, particularly in the late eighteenth century. I haven't found any analysis that breaks this down into the ""top 1%,"" unfortunately, but here is how historian Gary Nash breaks down several tax lists from colonial British North America:

1693 Philadelphia tax list:

* 0-30% bracket: 2.2% of wealth

* 31-60% bracket: 15.2% of wealth

* 61-90% bracket: 36.6% of wealth

* 91-100% bracket: 46.0% of wealth (13.2% in 91-95% bracket, 32.8% in 96-100% bracket)

1730 New York City tax list:

* 0-30% bracket: 6.2% of wealth

* 31-60% bracket: 13.9% of wealth

* 61-90% bracket: 36.5% of wealth

* 91-100% bracket: 43.7% of wealth (14.2% in 91-95% bracket, 25.4% in 96-100% bracket)

1767 Philadelphia tax list: 

* 0-30% bracket: 1.8% of wealth

* 31-60% bracket: 5.5% of wealth

* 61-90% bracket: 27.0% of wealth

* 91-100% bracket: 65.7% of wealth (16.2% in 91-95% bracket, 49.5% in 96-100% bracket)

1771 Boston tax list:

* 0-30% bracket: 0.1% of wealth

* 31-60% bracket: 9.1% of wealth

* 61-90% bracket: 27.4% of wealth

* 91-100% bracket: 63.4% of wealth (14.7% in 91-95% bracket, 48.7% in 96-100% bracket)

1774 Philadelphia tax list: 

* 0-30% bracket: 1.1% of wealth

* 31-60% bracket: 4% of wealth

* 61-90% bracket: 22.6% of wealth

* 91-100% bracket: 72.3% of wealth (16.8% in 91-95% bracket, 55.5% in 96-100% bracket)

While there are definitely limits to what this tells us, as I noted above, these numbers are a pretty powerful indication that there was, at least, a high concentration of wealth at the top end of urban society in eighteenth-century British North America—and that this concentration probably rose over the course of the eighteenth century. If you look at the top 10% bracket in Philadelphia, this rung of society went from owning 46% of wealth in 1693 to owning 72.3% in 1774. Compare that top 10% bracket to today, where (in 2013) the top 10% of families owned 76% of wealth. That's not so far off.

The 1774 Philadelphia tax list is particularly interesting to me, because it came just two years before the Declaration of Independence was signed in the same city. The enormous wealth stratification at the time, and the fact that many of the delegates who signed onto the notion that ""All men are created equal"" likely belonged to the top 10% of society, really sets that document into a different context.  

So what does this tell us? For me, it's an indication that industrialization cannot be regarded as the sole cause of wealth concentration. Having studied these tax lists, I can tell you that the wealthiest individuals in these societies tended to be merchants (with some exceptions). Just as in today's case where people can make huge fortunes through Wall Street and big banks, commerce and speculation were some of the main ways that individuals accumulated enormous amounts of wealth in the eighteenth century.

644,AskHistorians,Did the Spanish see the Aztecs as *racially* inferior or merely religiously and culturally inferior?,"So, this is quite an interesting question actually.  I'm not sure I can tell you a precise answer about the Aztecs, but I can tell you about Spanish attitudes regarding Native Americans in general.  It is generally accepted that modern ideas about race had not really existed for the first century or so of colonization.  What did exist was a much more fluid understanding of races and peoples, usually based on religion and culture.  

To give you some idea of what I mean, we first have to grasp some understanding of the ways that early European settlers understood the New World in general.  The two most popular ideas were that the New World was an Edenic realm where the people had not been touched by original sin, while the other, not so coincidentally, was a land where Satan had total sway over the people.  Both of these views were religious at their core, but were polar opposites ideologically.  The important thing, however, is that in neither views were the natives *fundamentally* unchangeable.  A sinner can be saved and a Saint can fall, if you see what I mean.

Second, the Spaniards in particular and the Europeans in general did not see their own races as necessarily fixed.  The ideas of the humors was current at the time with the idea that you had to balance the four humors to be healthy.  This idea was complicated by the fact that outside factors, including environment, effected the necessary balance.  So, the upshot is that many people thought that if you lived in a tropical place, such as most of Latin America and the Caribbean, you could literally turn into a person who looked like a native.  This did not even have to happen over generations.  The first Spanish settlers into the Caribbean imported, at great expense, foods that they would have eaten back in Spain, most notably grain which did not grow well in the new colonies.  At the same time, they tried to limit the amount of corn (maize) that they ate since it would turn them into Natives.  The flip side is that if Native Americans ate European food they could become more European.
 The question of Native wet nurses for Spanish children was also critical since the nurse could transfer her humors to the child.  An interesting later corollary occurred in the British colonies as late as the eighteenth century where many people believed that having sex with an African person (Usually a white woman having sex with a black man.  Let's play spot the sexism) would result in the white person literally darkening.

A related issue, which the Colonists explicitly and frequently invoked to justify colonization was the classic ""good use of the land"" argument.  Most of Europe was heavily agricultural.  They saw the lack of cultivation of crops that they liked, i.e. wheat, grapes, etc. as proof that the Natives were inferior to the Europeans.  There were some attempts to ""Europeanize"" the Natives by giving them European clothes and teaching them how to cultivate the land like Europeans, but these efforts were often undercut by Imperial legislation, most particularly sumptuary laws.  The efforts to make the Natives European also raised a tricky practical question.  If these guys become like us, what is the justification for ruling them?

A final factor, also religious, is that slavery in the 1500s was primarily based on religion and war.  Christians were not supposed to enslave other Christians, but Muslims, and frequently prisoners of war, were ok.  Of course, it did not take long for the Spaniards to effectively enslave many Native Americans on the well known *encomienda* and in the Spanish mines that dotted Latin America.  However, the Natives died off really fast and many of them had converted to Christianity as well, leading to both practical and theological problems with the arrangement.  Bartolemeo de las Casas famously defended the Native Americans and attacked their treatment before the King, though he also famously suggested African slaves to do the labor instead of Natives.

Racial attitudes changed drastically during the seventeenth century, when more permanent notions concerning race began to develop.  By that time so many Natives had died that they posed little to no threat and the importation of African slaves began to take off in a big way.  

The upshot of all this is that the inferiority of the Natives was heavily weighted toward culture and religion, rather than a modern understanding of race.  However, the exact degree of inferiority is a question in and of itself.  Not surprisingly, opinions differed greatly.  But, as the empire continued to expand and generate more profit, the Spanish (and later the other European empires) came up with other ideas to justify their rule, increasingly relying on race rather than religion.

Hope this helps answer your question!

645,AskHistorians,New Jersey granted women and racial minorities the right to vote in it's 1776 constitution. The state took away this rights in 1807. How and why did this occur?,"""Remember, all men would be tyrants if they could,"" wrote Abigail Adams in 1776. Thirty-five years later, she might well have added ""and they're not shy about trying."" Scholars today generally agree that the (recognized then as) unconstitutional theft of voting rights in 1807 was essentially a strategy in white male-led political parties' jockeying for power over the state. However, the specific assumptions and ideologies that made the strategy attractive and effective depended on racism, sexism, nationalism, classism, and good old-fashioned fear.

Jan Lewis suggests that the voting rights of New Jersey's black women, white women, black men, and foreign-born residents were initially recognized simply out of revolutionary Americans' commitment to the underly egalitarianism of republican ideals. Irwin Gertzog is more pragmatic, arguing that the added specificity of ""he or she"", first restricted to half the state (1790) and eventually extended to the whole (1797), was already a calculated power ploy. 

Either way, by 1798 it's clear that the major political parties in the state, the Federalists and the Republicans, recognized especially the voting power of women. Despite the implicit and explicit restrictions on which women could vote--enslaved black women could not; free black and white women who were married could not (because under the law of coverture, they could not own property independently)--contemporary observers were daunted by the scale of potential women voters. A 1791 newspaper article was titled ""The Humble Address of Ten Thousand Federal Maids""; in 1799, William Griffith similarly estimated, ""of widows and spinsters above
twenty one, there can not, I imagine be fewer than 10,000."" In a state where elections could be decided by hundreds or even tens of votes, 10,000 was a daunting number.

Furthermore, an idea was developing that we might consider a precursor to identity politics: the belief that groups like ""women"" and ""black men"" were homogenous blocs of voting interest. (But of course white men can have their own opinions.) On one hand, this meant that each party worked *furiously* to court The Woman Voter in hotly contested elections like the Essex County legislator race of 1797 (in which this all-powerful voting bloc amounted *seventy-five* women; I have not seen statistics on their race). On the other, it meant that both parties deeply feared the potential for women, black men, and immigrants to vote for the bad guys. 

And naturally, *both* parties developed a conviction that women, especially, would turn out for the other. Naturally, too, these parallel developments were both motivated by classism. Federalists worried that it was easier to get women to vote in (Republican-stronghold) towns than in (Federalist-stronghold) cities; Republicans worried that the women more likely to vote were the wealthier, conservative Federalists. They also seem to have simply assumed that black men and women were Federalists, period.

Or at least, the party leadership--that is, the men actively seeking to acquire and maintain power--did. A ballot initiative to strip the vote from everyone with at least 50 pounds of property and implement a white male taxpayer-based system failed *miserably* with the general population. There was a definite rift developing between the regular electorate and the power-holders, who had nervously watched the French Revolution tear down waves of political leaders and feared a similar outcome if more widespread participation in American politics.

The years between the 1800 election that so focused on winning women voters and 1806-07, when efforts to restrict suffrage kicked back up, witnessed several important developments. First, The Black Voter played the role of the desperately wooed in the 1804 election that The Woman Voter had in 1800, coupled with New Jersey's passage of a gradual emancipation law. 

Second, newspapers were filled with two-sided worry. Women voters were more likely to commit election fraud (generally accusations that enslaved women or free married women were sneaking in a vote); women were neglecting their proper duties to get involved in politics and society was falling apart; the initial constitutional recognition of women's voting wrights was wrong. BUT it was just that: a constitutional right, so they couldn't be deprived of it without a new constitution, and that wasn't happening. 

Judith Klinghoffer and Lois Elkis have argued that sexist ideology (they are not really concerned with race, unfortunately) had little to no role to play in these developments; the evidence does not seem to back that up. As with the editorials arguing that the 1776 constitution and 1790/97 amendments were wrong in extending voting rights to women, gender is not silent. But it's not the *driving* or causal factor. Rather, we can see how sexist and racist ideology played into the lust for political power and control, or rather, became the field on which it played out. The assumption that all women and all black people voted the same; the belief that losses were due to election fraud and of course it was women and black people committing the fraud.

(For the record: Gertzhog says it was actually mostly men, and there is evidence for this. A lot of the fraud involved keeping polls open days or weeks too long, or waiting until the ballots for an area dominated by the other party were counted and announced so they'd know how many to...scrounge up in order to win. In other words: tactics conceived and operated by party leadership, i.e. white men).

But while the initial recognition of voting rights and the first efforts at suppressing them had come from inter-party conflict, it was actually *intra*-party problems that ultimately killed suffrage for property-owning unmarried free black and white women and black men. Once again, the immediate cause was electoral politics and the relentless pursuit of power by white men; the means were racism and sexism.

In 1804, the Republican party split both geographically and ideologically into a ""moderate"" and ""liberal"" wing (with the Federalists occupying the other ""conservative"" pole). Among other things, the liberals actually wanted *universal* suffrage, not even connected to property ownership! But naturally, this rivalry played out as ""The Room Where It Happens."" New Jersey needed a new courthouse, and the dominating Republicans were at war with themselves whether to put it in the liberal north or the moderate south.

And a presidential election loomed.

The moderates offered a compromise: we'll let you put the courthouse in (Republican) Newark if you agree to restrict voting to white male citizen taxpayers. And this will restore party unity and *we won't support the Federalist candidate.* So in this case, we know exactly what the moderates said to the liberals to get them to sell black and white women's and black men's suffrage down the river: political power.

The liberal Republicans' acceptance of this bargain, thus, betrays their own racism and sexism. The desire to stay in power brought into conflict egalitarian republican ideals of equality and contemporary white patriarchy; white patriarchy won *in order for* their political power goals to succeed. Race and sex were not the cause, but were the tools.

646,AskHistorians,"At age 18, Edgar Allan Poe joined the US Army in 1827 as a Private, and left in 1829 as a Sergeant Major of Artillery. How did he attain the highest enlisted rank in just two years?","Oh boy is this a question, and dont worry you arent the first to wonder. Hell even current and former soldiers have thought, how the Hell did this happen, especially when less than 2 years later he would be dismissed(intentionally on his part) from West Point for misconduct. 

So lets lay down the basic facts, in late May 1827 Poe lies about his age and identity to enlist in Company H, 1st Artillery in Boston. He would be promoted to Sgt Major in January 1829, and was released 2 years into a 5 year enlistment that April in order to work towards acceptance to West Point which he would enter the following year, and then Spring 1831 would see him dismissed and his military career over for good. 

In October 1827 the Company(along with the HQ of the 1st Aritllery) was sent from Boston to Ft Moultrie outside Charleston, and later Ft Monroe at the tip of the VA Peninsula guarding Hampton Roads. And Col House, CO of the regiment would be the one to promote Poe, and was personally familiar with him as they had been colocated for most of that time. 

And despite his later personal demons, Poe actually made a fine soldier, was regarded as energetic, reliable, and bright. He also had something of a family legacy to live up to as a grandfather had been a quartermaster in the Continentals. 

We can also note that about a year in Poe was promoted to Artificer, essentially the equivalent of a modern day Specialist. In that role he had responsibility for the care and condition of the artillery stores, and especially those new varieties of temperamental explosive shells! 

So in the relatively flat enlisted org structure Poe was one of maybe 20 or so senior enlisted already with his company, which was itself only led by a 1st LT, and the CO of the regiment was present with him at the time. 

It was the in late 1828 that Poe began to desire to leave the ranks, he revealed his deceptions to his Company Commander, a LT Howard. Howard then had Poe speak to Col House(and told Poe to write to his foster father), and shortly after Poe was reassigned to work with the regimental Adjutant as part of headquarters. Then just a few weeks later House exercises his authority in the matter and makes Poe his Regimental Sgt Major in January 1829.

Remember too that the Army was routinely short of men and had trouble filling the authorized establishment, or saw attrition to illness and desertion, with 75% authorized strength present not being a crazy baseline. An artillery company of the 1820's only had a max authorized force of 42 privates, 3 artificers, 4 corporals, and 3 sgts. The HQ then only had the Sgt Major and Quartermaster Sgt at least officially. So with such a small group, with the companies of the regiment rarely concentrated more than 2-3 to a post, it was easier for one to standout. 

We honestly dont have hard explanations one way or the other. Poe was clearly a good soldier, and could now be honest about his slightly notable family history, was already a budding writer, and had some education from his stint at UVA. Those are traits that are certainly welcome in a senior enlisted in the peacetime artillery branch pre war. At least one source also mentions House was something of a lover of literature so there is another point of commonality for the two. 

It was also about this time that Lt Col Worth rejoined the regiment from a stint at West Point and it could also be that his experiences there, and history of making the jump from enlisted to officer, are what pushed Poe over the edge to not just want to get out, but then go to the USMA. Their post at the time, Fortress Monroe may also have played a role. It was the closest thing to a home the artillery had, as it was home to the Artillery School. When possible artillery companies would be concentrated there for a year or so and trained up as a group, and new West Point grads would also spend a year or so there if they were destined for the artillery. So Poe would have had plenty of exposure to recent grads. 

Worth seems to have been onboard with the idea as he helped advocate for his appointment as a cadet. And so with his relationship patched for the time being with John Allen, and his commanders in his corner, he was released from his contract that Spring.

People, including the Jewish population, knew about concentration camps. As early as 1933 aft er the founding of the Dachau camp, Concentration Camps and the Concentration Camp system were referenced often in decrees issued by state agencies as well as by the news media, which hailed the development as a bold and necessary step (Himmler giving the press conference for the opening of Dachau). Here are some examples: [Münchner Neueste Nachrichten reporting the opening of Dachau](http://www.vulture-bookz.de/imagebank/Dokumente/images/1933-03-21~Bekanntmachung_KL_Dachau.jpg); a newspaper from Brandenburg [reporting about prisoner transfers to Oranienburg](http://www.stiftung-bg.de/kz-oranienburg/images/597.jpg); the Sindelfinger Zeitung [reporting arrests of communists and their transfer to the Heuberg Concentration Camp in March 1933](https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=512x1024:format=gif/path/s190e0533b578352d/image/i7b28571eeff9a93d/version/1383406510/image.gif). Similarly, people were aware during the war that the Soviets and especially the Jewish Soviets were treated very badly and even murdered. We have documents such as diaries and letters starting in 1941 that talk about relatives returning from the front or writing from the front about the Einsatzgruppen murdering Jewish commissars, Soviet PoWs starving to death and so forth.

Similarly, with the deportations from Germany starting in 1941, there was a certain awareness that the conditions in ""the East"" were not very good for those deported and that people died. However, the first deportations of German Jews in the winter of 41 mostly went to Ghettos in Minsk and the Baltics where the previous inhabitants – the Jews of these areas – had been murdered prior to their arrival in order to make space for the German Jews. Many of these deported Jews died to the intentionally poor conditions but with the German Jews, the policy of killing them on arrival only came in 1942. One indication that Auschwitz as a destination did not necessarily hold the horror it would, say, two years later when German spouuses of German Jews took to the streets in the Rosenstraße protests knowing that deportation meant death, comes from a letter by Clara Grunewald – German schjool teacher and pioneer of the Montessori paedagogical system. In August 1942 Grunewald wrote to her friend Clotilde Schewnck zu Schweinsberg: ""The people went to Auschwitz near Krakau, that's a transit camp. And if you mean Hetta Meyer [another friend of theirs who had been deported]? She went to Theresienstadt. YOu can tell her relatives that it isn't that bad. The old and sick are well taken care of there."" They weren't. Hetta Meyer died after a couple of weeks in Theresienstadt while Clara Grunewald was also deported to Auschwitz where she was murdered in 1943.

And while many German Jews lacked concrete knowledge of the horror that awaited during and after deportation, others had a stronger awareness that it meant nothing doog when compared to Grunewald. Adolf Guttentag, a medical doctor fromn Breslau writes in his diary prior to deportation to Theresienstadt in September of 1942 twrites about his elderly neighbour of 87 who said he was not going to bow and therefore killed himself. He also writes about considering killing himself together with his wife and supplying his elderly mother with enough sleepping medication to do the same – something he would do barely a month later shortly before his final deportation.

A similar awareness of the situation can be gleaned from a document in the files of the Düsseldorf Gestpo from October 1942 concerning the case of Anne Baum. Baum had married the Jewish company owner Mayimilian Baum in 1917 and had had several children with him. While their youngest son had already been evacuated from Germany on one of the so-called Kindertransporte to Great Britain, their duaghter Irmgard, born in 1919, had not left Germany and was regarded as a Jew by Nazi German authorities. And while Maximilian Baum remained spared from deportation due to his ""Ariian"" spouse, their daughter did not and was deported to the Izbica Ghetto in April 1942, where she was murdered. In October 1942, Anne lodged severl inquiries with her local Gestapo in Düsseldorf concerning location and fate of her daughter.

In the protocal recorded by Hermann Waldbillig, Waldbillig writes that the Gestapo will not give her any information concerning the location of her daughter, that further inquiries with any sort of official burecratic institution is senseless and that her daughter will not be returned to Germnany. In her original letter, Anne Baum had mentioned severl things she had heard about those resettled:

> When shopping in the bakery of Mr. Ehrmann I overheard a nurse and civilian talk about how the Jews in the east had to dig their own graves and then were killed with a shot to the nape of the neck. Other Jews had been placed in an ambulance that was then filled with gas in order to kill them. [...] I am convinced that those rumors are not true and I demand to know about my daughters fate in order to disprove such vicious propaganda.

All of these things Anne Baum had heard were true. But Waldbillig warned her to never repeat those rumors for that would consititue a crime.

The fact that while there was knowledge of what happened to deported Jews floati9ng aropund Germany in 1942, people still went to assigned place in order to be concentrated, hearded into a train and sent off to an uncertain and very dangerous fate has to do with the fact that after all, it is very hard to shatter a person's relationship to state authority. When organizing these deportations, the letters and declarations people received were steeped in legalistic police language and splattered with official seals and signatures. It came from the police after all. While there were people who took active steps to avoid deportation – not going to the synagogue, staying with friends and so forth – there were also people whose faith that while the state they lived in might discriminate against them, they would not outright murder them and their families was strong. In the modern world we are conditioned to follow laws and directives and to asusme good faith on behalf of ""our"" state, ""our"" country, ""our"" government. Hence, people – often despite existing knowledge – would bow to faith, surerender to the police and go and do what they were told – up to wlaking into the gas chamber on arrival still clingin to the hope that it really was only a shower.

At the same time the Nazi regime used all this in order to make everything seem less threatening and more legitimate by couching it in the symbols and language of odfficial state buisness – from letters of deportation sent by the police to giving everyone a ticket on their journey to ""the East"".

It's these things coupled with assurance from people in unfiforms, people who had the air of being officials that lead to so many deportations running so smoothly."
649,AskHistorians,"If samurais were mostly horse archer, and those on foot are mainly using spears, then how come we get the “the katana” culture that is so popular today?","The perception of Samurai being exclusively mounted archers is just as flawed as the one where they’re katana-wielding warriors marching on foot in the heat of every battle. In reality, the samurai were more an economic/political caste, whose role as warriors came and went over the years.

The mounted archer “samurai” was most predominant in the Heian period, (790-1190, give or take 5 years.) During this time, samurai were indeed mostly archers who rode into battle on horseback in flashy armor, though the horses and armor were mostly there to flaunt wealth. Samurai occupied a role one step below that of the Daimyo, or local liege lord. (Daimyo were in turn one step below the Emperor, then later the Shogun, though especially during this time period their agency within their lands was far greater.) Thus, samurai were mostly either court bodyguards or mid-low level nobles (or both), who only occasionally had to march out and disperse peasant revolts or small invasions. During these revolts, they were for the most part greatly outnumbered and up against men with spears and little training or morale. The Katana just isn’t useful during these engagement, so setting up 100 men on a hill and pelting the crowd with arrows (all while looking impressive and rich) usually did the trick. When it came to disputes over territory or what have you between local lords, usually champion samurai were sent out to fight it out, one on one. 

This strategy famously fails the samurai of Japan during the invasion of the Mongol Empire in the tail end of the 13th century, and thus the kamakura period (which established feudalism and the daimyo + samurai cast as far more important) ends as one shogunate (the Ashikaga) replace another, (the minamoto.) at this point, samurai are truly samurai, owning small fiefdoms of their own sometimes and even endeavoring at times to spread their own political power. 

The warring states period 200+ years later greatly expands the role of the samurai though, who now often take up positions as captains or generals within larger armies. Though the vast majority of soldiers during the time are still just peasants with spears, Samurai increasingly join the fray wielding pole arms, bows, and katana, and as a last resort, short swords known as wakizashi. Still, even during this time, we don’t see many Katana wielding monster samurai. 

The warring states period ends with the unification of Japan, and a great period of peace that lasts nearly 250 years. During this new Edo period, samurai mostly lose their day jobs as warriors. They take to academia and courtly business, developing mathematic and philosophical systems, as well as theorizing on science and politics. They maintain their positions, to some extent their power, but with almost no battles to fight over 250 years... the only swordsman samurai still present were third or fourth generation students at swords dojo’s, more hobbyists than real warriors (even though some of them were pretty damned skilled.) 

To keep an already long answer from dragging any further: Meiji restoration comes. Half of Japan wants to modernize, half of Japan wants a return to the status quo. Samurai lose their positions early on in Meiji, (were up to the 1870s-1880s by now) and the caste system as a whole breaks down. THIS is when the master swordsman samurai myth emerges and takes shape in a way we might recognize it today. Those who opposed modernization and the end of a long isolationist period harkened back to the past, or a rather fictionalized version of it. Samurai were great warriors now, not politicians or landlords. They fought noble battles with swords, layered 7-8 times over on the forge to be able to pierce STEEL. Thus, a legendary class of warrior roots itself into the zeitgeist of a tense period in Japanese history, and the role, bravery, nobility, and legend of the samurai becomes greatly over exaggerated. 


TLDR: Samurai were never entirely mounted archers, nor entirely sword-swinging masters of combat. Sometimes they were a private police force for daimyo, sometimes they owned small bits of land and fought on the side, and sometimes they were a caste of scholars and mathematicians. The image we have of samurai now is greatly influenced by pop culture, which was in turn greatly influenced by the propagandized version of Samurai heralded by the last holdouts of the Edo period, men challenged by modernization and looking for a return to the glory of the past.

Edit: a word"
650,AskHistorians,"What was the reason female pubic hair in 16th-18th cent. Europe was used as a lover's gift, a souvenir, or even a wig, even at a time when women's body hair was already beginning to be treated as masculine and unwanted?","Okay, where to start ...

>Apparently Charles II had a full wig. George IV gifted some from his mistress to a sex club.

The wig of Charles II is apocryphal. So, in the 1730s a club for gentlemen who wanted to drink, party, and have sex was started in Edinburgh called the ""Beggar's Benison"" (if you want to know more about the ""hellfire clubs"" of the day, you should ask a new question because I can't give you much there), where there was reportedly a wig made from samples of pubic hair of each member's wife or mistress, which was worn by the leader. In 1775, some of the members split off and formed the ""Wig Club"" around a wig made out of the pubic hair of Charles II's mistresses. Said wig no longer exists. There are no records of what happened to it in the century between Charles's death and the birth of the Wig Club. And there's no reason to think it was real. (The one source I can find that goes into detail on it makes no sense, saying that it was made before Charles went into exile during the Interregnum - so, like, before he was 16 [edited from 18, because I do math gud], which is already a little unbelievable, at a time when wigs weren't even the fashion. When wigs did come into fashion, they were long and luscious, and a wig made of pubes would just be hideous to their standard of hairdressing as well as our own mores.)

Another bad pop source says that then the Beggar's Benison club went out and made a wig of their own from the pubic hair of George III's mistresses - a very problematic suggestion because George III was famously a devoted husband who didn't have any mistresses. More realistically, when George *IV* visited Scotland in 1822 he gave them a snuffbox with the pubic hair of a mistress, an artifact still in the collection of St. Andrew's University; he'd been made an honorary member from afar in 1783, so he was likely well aware of the club and its sexual practices, and collected and donated the hair very deliberately.

>Women might gift it in a love letter.

The only reference to this that I'm aware of is a letter from Lady Caroline Lamb to Lord Byron in 1812. The pair had engaged in a torrid but short extramarital affair over the course of that summer, writing constantly to each other during that time. Byron was kind of a jerk and tried to ghost her when he was tired of the relationship, but she was not ready to let him go and continued to write despite the lack of response. One of the extreme acts she resorted to when trying to win him back - in addition to trying to kill herself in front of him - was to clip some of her pubic hair and include it in a letter. She was unsuccessful. As far as I know, other women did not do this and it was not by any means just the kind of thing that might be normally sent as a token of affection.

>It seems that even as materials for removing hair (and the gender-rolled desire to do so) were emerging

This is actually a misconception that's crept in here which somewhat undermines the entire question. We have very little evidence of body hair being considered masculine and unwanted during the early modern period; *Reading Sex in the Eighteenth Century: Bodies and Gender in English Erotic Culture* quotes a poem that extols the beauty of different women's pubic hair, and notes that many texts describe the hair as an inherent part of the female genitalia. In some cases, they praised it as a kind of veil that preserved feminine modesty even in nakedness. It's the early twentieth century when we start to see ads specifically targeting women to sell razors, and then the use of waxing, sugaring, and other chemical depilators on the armpits and legs. Hair on the *face* was certainly unwanted, but underarm, leg, and pubic hair were simply expected parts of the naked female body in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries."
651,AskHistorians,How many 16th century French laying hens would be required to feed Gaston his five dozen eggs?,"Goddamn. This has to be the most random-ass hilarious question I might be somewhat capable of answering.

**As per usual, disclaimer:** I'm not an expert on poultry science. Culinary history is a hobby field for me, and I've occasionally looked into the surge of backyard chicken-keeping in the U.S. and Canada because apparently I have nothing better to do. Heritage breeds are very popular for small-time poultry keepers, and people are generally quite interested in the history behind these breeds. This may not be more than a decent guess, and even that might be kind.

**You're absolutely right that modern chickens have been bred to be more productive than their ancient forebears.** The modern laying chicken according to PSU's College of Agricultural Sciences is a White Leghorn for white eggs or a sex-linked hybrid of New Hampshire Red/Barred Plymouth Rock descent for brown eggs. (And by sex-linked hybrid, we mean a chick that can be sexed the day of its birth; the unfortunate reality is that cockerel chicks are of little value to the industry and are typically killed.) These birds exist solely to produce eggs, whether for consumption or breeding, and a hen in the prime of her life (20 to 85 weeks) can crank out 300+ per year.

300 eggs would have been an insane number for a bird in ... uh, whenever *Beauty and the Beast* is set. We'll get to that in a moment. Suffice it to say that the average small farmer in times past generally couldn't afford, or didn't have the space, to breed both meat and laying chickens. They were also reluctant to slaughter a bird that was still productive even if that productivity was declining, which is why the majority of chicken recipes from before the 20th century assume the use of an older bird. It is not a mistake that just about every poultry-keeping culture you can name had an abundance of recipes for old birds (e.g., the incredible array of chicken soups from around the world) and relatively few for younger ones.

**In terms of actually answering your question, I think the logical progression is:**

 - When is *Beauty and the Beast* set?
 - Where is *Beauty and the Beast* set?
 - What breeds of chicken were common in that era and place?
 - What are these breeds' productivity?

**So when is *Beauty and the Beast* actually set?** I googled this because I wasn't sure and just wanted a frigging date. Disney, *you're killing me*. The original story comes from a French fairy tale either written or transcribed by Gabrielle-Susanne Barbot de Villeneuve in 1740. However, if we assume the matches that Lumiere uses in the animated 1991 version date the film, then it can't have happened before 1805 when the match was invented (conveniently enough, in Paris). But then there's the Eiffel Tower that the magic forks assemble during ""Be Our Guest,"" and construction on the Eiffel Tower was between 1887 and 1889. I haven't seen the live-action version yet and I don't know the degree to which it differs.

Luke Evans (who plays Gaston in the live-action adaptation) said his characterization of Gaston assumes he was around 16 in 1740. Evans is 37 now, so let's argue that Gaston is somewhere between his late 20s and late 30s in the film, which dates it to 1750-1763. The fashion design seems to put the film squarely in 18th-century France. Other materials distributed by Disney vaguely reference ""Bourbon France,"" which means sometime between 1589 (Henry IV) and 1792 (French Revolution and boom goes the monarchy) and I assume not the brief-lived Bourbon restoration (1814 or 1815 depending on how you choose to define ""restored"" until 1830).

Mid-18th century it is. My head hurts and we are moving the fuck on.

**Where is *Beauty and the Beast* set?** For the 1991 film, Disney's art department used both the Loire Valley (central France) and the towns of Riquewihr and Ribeauvillé as inspirations for the setting. This is a bit problematic as both towns are several hundred miles to the east of the Loire Valley, but whatever. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if anyone on the live-action film has commented on the specific setting. We'll say somewhere in north-northeastern rural France where: a). people are forced into choirs at birth, and: b). can harmonize in adulthood at will.

**What breeds of chicken were common in that era and place?** This is very tough. France has produced an incredible variety of livestock, and unfortunately much of the historical record concerning it has yet to be translated. We'll do the best we can with the information available in English. There are a few we can eliminate right off the bat (e.g., the Estaires didn't appear in Europe until the late 19th century, the Coucou de Rennes is from the wrong region, etc.), but quite a few remain. However, there are at least three ancient French breeds that comfortably predate the mid-18th century and would have been common in northern/northeastern France:

 - **The La Flèche:** A good all-purpose bird that was (and remains) popular with small farmers for both meat and eggs. The modern La Flèche generally lays around 3 eggs/week between March/April and October.
 - **The Houdan:** A more ornamental breed that originates from Yvelines (west of Paris) and was a reliable egg producer but so-so as a meat bird (large but slow-growing). Like the La Flèche, it would generally produce around 3 eggs/week from spring to mid-autumn.
 - **The Bresse Gauloise:** This is now most famous as a meat bird and is the breed that, when slaughtered, becomes the *poulet de Bresse,* the darling of the professional chef's table. You can put this on a menu at any foodie destination and charge whatever you want. Again, another 3 egg/week layer.

There are definitely more, but these are the only ones I can absolutely confirm after running through my library and cross-checking online.

**Do we have records of these breeds' productivity?** If we do, I'm not sure that records of their mid-18th century production exist in English, but let's take the figure of 3 eggs per week between March and October. Gaston's already in trouble. The modern backyard/hobby farmer you cite who's getting 4 eggs/week per bird is nearly always raising chickens as a sort of combination pet and egg producer. The growth of backyard chicken-keeping has prejudiced the market in favor of breeds that fit this profile, e.g., the Buff Orpington, the Rhode Island Red, and Ameraucana. For that matter, even 4 eggs/week is a bit generous for these birds; not a lot of people have the stomach to slaughter their chickens as their productivity declines, so 4 eggs/week assumes a young bird that's eating well and is at her most productive. There *is* a French breed, the Marans, that can match this output, but it's not in contention for feeding Gaston here as it was developed in the 20th century. 

Again, without hard records on exactly how productive the La Flèche, Houdan, and Bresse Gauloise were during the mid-18th century, I can't say with 100% certainty that 3 eggs/week is what you'd get. I will say based on the scanty information I've seen on hen productivity before the industrialization of agriculture is that it's a very plausible number.

**All right. Gaston is probably -- or at least *plausibly* -- stuck with birds that were laying 3 eggs/week.** If that's the case and he's eating 420 eggs per week, then he will need a flock of 140 chickens -- or realistically a bit more to account for randomness and the occasional loss of a bird to predators or theft -- to satisfy his protein intake. Additionally, this also assumes that the birds in question are eating well, and that will depend on the farmer's income (can he afford to supplement their foraging?) and their environment (are they well-supplied with insects and plants, or are there too many birds for the farmer's land to support?).

Also, he's going to have a hard time between October and March, because all of these breeds would have been subject to the normal seasonal cycle, and egg output would have declined or stopped entirely. Due to this, he would have needed substantially more than 140 chickens so he could pool eggs ahead of time to get himself through the winter (and eggs, if not stripped of their protective membrane, will last for a few months).

652,AskHistorians,How close was Japan to cracking Navajo code talkers? Was Japan aware Americans were using a Native American language as code?,"I did a research project with Navajo sources on this. It sadly never was finished and published, but I was able to use local archives, talk to members of the Navajo community about their verbal histories and study the US military documents regarding the code. I was also studying Navajo Language at time as I am not Navajo or a member of any tribe.

Four separate things kept the Navajo code from being cracked. In order of importance, this was the code itself, the Navajo language, it's use, and the Japanese intelligence community.

The code itself was relatively simple and was a glorified slang with a weird syntax. With applications for the military alphabet. Here is an example of ship names provided by the CIA [https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2008-featured-story-archive/navajo-images/Navajo-ships.jpg/image.jpg](https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2008-featured-story-archive/navajo-images/Navajo-ships.jpg/image.jpg). In English or any other language this could be cracked with time. Imagine a modern US infantry squad calling for ""Apache support"". To someone without knowledge of US weapon systems, this would seem like a very strange request. However after a few times hearing that and having helicopter gunships show up, the link could be drawn and part of the code could be cracked.

The next step in encryption that kept it safe was the language itself. Navajo is certainly one of the most difficult languages in the world to learn. Very very few non-Navajo have ever been nearly fluent in the language. Navajo heavily relies on inflections of tone and use of nasal noises on vowels, so simple changes in pitch of a vowel mean a completely different word. It is also extremely specific on conjugating verbs, using singular, dual and plural. Among many other complexities.

Navajo was (it's doing much better now due to many programs and educational outreach), a dying language and very few texts on it existed at the time. It's language family is the Athabaskan language, composed of a few other tribal languages in the American SW and several in central and western Canada. This is not a language where one could go pick a book off the shelf.

There was a Navajo POW in Japanese captivity, Joe Kieyoomia, who was not part of the Code Talker program. He was forced to listen to the transmissions by his captors. The Japanese had studied the Navajo transmissions and had narrowed it down through a lengthy process (I cannot understand Japanese so I was unable to read the primary sources on this, sorry for the vagueness), to figure out that it was Navajo. Kieyoomia listened into these transmissions and heard phrases like ""Red soil ahead"" among all of the organizational information that was also coded. He thought it was complete gibberish, and told the Japanese that it made no sense. The Japanese thought he was lying, and I'll get into their response more to the code later, and tortured him regularly in an attempt to get more information about the Navajo language and code out of him.

Third, the Navajo Code was a tactical, and very rarely strategic code that was only submitted verbally. The Navajo Code was never used in a written form. If it had been, it could have been subjected to the same methods of code breaking that the world was using on operational and strategic codes like Enigma. The Navajo code was far less complex than Enigma and would not have held up well to such attacks. Audio recordings on wax cylinders were expensive and difficult to maintain in the Pacific theater, so even recording the radio messages that the Code Talkers sent was incredibly difficult.

The Navajo Code was not only used on a tactical level, but on a much smaller scale than US operational codes. When the Code Talkers program was under development, it's major selling point wasn't it's heavy encryption, but time. The current way for US forces to communicate on a open level was either ""in the clear"", i.e. just over the radio, or to use an encoding machine that usually took about an hour to encode and decode messages. The latter wasn't great when you needed fire support, and the former the Japanese heavily exploited with their relatively high percentage of fluent English speakers. They did so both gathering intelligence on American activities and sending false messages to sew confusion and disorder.

Code Talkers on the other hand, could communicate messages to other Code Talkers nearly instantly. Fire support, movements, positions, could all be transmitted nearly ""in the clear"" in terms of speed. Also, Code Talkers worked like a sort of passcode, or key. With Navajo being so complex and the Code Talkers being such a small group, they were able to absolutely recognize and know each other during transmissions. And once attached units also recognized this, Code Talkers messages were treated as critically important, the Japanese couldn't falsely transmit them. There are cases of false Japanese messages being sent out as if they were American, and then Code Talkers letting everyone know of the real situation. This uniqueness kept the code in the military arsenal (and the Navajo language was classified) until 1965, when frequency hopping radios started to become available and replaced the Code Talkers concept.

Finally, the Japanese Intelligence Community. I again, do not understand Japanese, so none of this is a primary source and I won't go into much detail as it is not my expertise. The Japanese Intelligence Community was an absolute shambles. The Army/Navy rivalry was replicated between the different organizations, resulting in no real clear unified efforts and quite a few efforts to steal glory from each other. There were more focused on American operation codes that were transmitted in text, far more regularly and often and contained more information. It also seems that Kieyoomia's resistance to Japanese efforts also led the Japanese to believe that it really was just the language, and such limited their code breaking efforts there.

The Navajo (and others!) Code Talkers provided a critical role for the Allied war effort. Much of the information on the Code Talkers is still only in verbal histories.  There are many issues regarding Tribal Sovereignty around collecting this information and publishing it, so information can be hard to come by. I highly respect those issues and recommend you all do too. 

Thanks!

As a post script, the Germans actually sent Anthropologists to the US during the inter-war to study Tribal languages after the success of similar Tribal Code Talkers in WW1. I have been unable to find if this information was ever put to much use, as other tribes' Code Talkers were used in the European Theater.

Edit: Thank you for the gold, but please, please stop. I wrote below about the commodifying of cultural knowledge, and this is exactly what I was speaking about. I give this knowledge freely, and ask that if interested, you all check out Navajo sources for more info! Or just go check out r/Navajo to see what the Navajo Nation is like today!

Also, this wasn't a thesis project or anything big like that, it was just a semester undergrad research project that I really felt a calling to. I apologize for any confusion there.

653,AskHistorians,"How did the Ming Vase become the deFacto ""priceless"" object often broken in comedy? Why specifically Ming Dynasty crockery? How is it exceptional, yet common enough for a bunch of people to own?","Awesome question. **An answer to your question lies at the crossroads of the rising middle class in 19th century Western society, Western fascination with the Orient, and noir detective novels.** I'll refer you to Stacey Pierson's *From Object to Concept: Global Consumption and the Transformation of Ming Porcelain*, which is spot-on what you're looking for, and some of the works of Maxine Berg, who edited *Goods from the East, 1600-1800* and has written extensively on trade between East Asia and western Europe.

From the 17th century onward, Chinese porcelain was exported in bulk to Western Europe, which saw it as a luxury commodity. The Dutch East India Company was a huge importer, and other European nations were eager to follow suit. Chinese porcelain was seen as a high-quality item when compared with contemporary European ceramics. Its delicacy, design and durability made porcelain a major consumer good in the Eurasian trade. Berg's [""In Pursuit of Luxury: Global History and British Consumer Goods in the 18th Century""](http://enseignement.typepad.fr/files/bergpastpresent2004-1.pdf) (*Past and Present*, 2004) describes this trade and goes on to explain that when it came to Asian manufactured goods (including porcelain), ""these goods were ... not the ancient or Persian luxuries of corruption and vice, the gold and rubies of the Indies. They were luxuries associated with a civilized way of life, appealing especially to the middling classes.""

European manufacturers were no slouches, of course. When they saw the prices porcelain was fetching, they were eager to duplicate this ""white gold."" Starting in the 18th century, they managed to do just that. Porcelain moved from a luxury product to a bourgeois one. In the 19th century, mass production allowed it to become a lower-class consumer good as well. At the same time, the men and women who worked in the factories creating European ceramics (and a bewildering variety of other products) had the money for hobbies and interests beyond the means of the lower class.

One important thing to know about the middle class, and particularly the British middle class in the middle of the 19th century is the uncertainty of it all. Men and women alike were striving to join the upper classes, but they were uncertain whether their industrial employment was acceptable in polite society. I've written before about the [rise of the beard in the 19th century West](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6cgaa2/how_would_i_a_man_who_cant_seem_to_grow_facial/dhvkjhf/) as a reaction to the crisis of masculinity among the urbanizing middle class.

This uncertainty about middle class life and constant striving toward respectability meant there was a surge in affectation: Middle-class households attempted to imitate aspects of upper-class society as best as they could afford. One of these affectations was the collecting of ceramics. The Chinese porcelain imported in the 17th century was extraordinarily high quality and highly collectible. In 1889, [the *New York Times* quoted a *Saturday Review* piece](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9505E2DD1F3BE533A25756C2A9679C94609ED7CF) that explained, ""To a native collector an unquestionable piece of Sung Dynasty crackled porcelain is much what a Mazarin Bible is to a book collector among ourselves, and the best specimens of the products of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) are scarcely less valued. Vases within which are painted with lions rolling balls, or dragons with phoenixes, fetch prices which would astonish even the eager buyers at the salesrooms in King Street; and when genuine pieces of blue and white of this period are offered for sale they find a constantly rising market. It is recorded that about a hundred years ago a pair of cups of this last kind was valued by native collectors at £300.""

As Pierson writes on page 62 of her book, ""the notion of connoisseurship of such ceramics ... was not novel at this time at all, especially when connoisseurship as an activity was gaining in popularity and recognition through collector's clubs and related literature. ... Art dealers were also active in this arena with a number of shops in London featuring what were still often called 'oriental ceramics'. The art market was well developed and connoisseurship naturally accompanied this.""

Chinese porcelain, not just the high-quality material manufactured at Sevres or by Wedgwood, had a special cachet in this time period. During the 19th century, there was a surprising affinity for Chinese products and Western products that imitated Chinese styles in the technique known as *chinoiserie.* Authenticity was prized just as it is today, and the combination of the period's Sinophilia with the Euro-American penchant for antiquarianism meant older Chinese porcelain was valued. 

Ming porcelain itself was singled out for particular treatment starting in the 1870s. Charles Dickens' periodical, *All the Year Round*, mentions it specifically in its April 1875 issue, and the *Art Journal* references it as well that same year. Now, that's different from *the Ming vase*, which develops out of the general idea of Ming porcelain a few years later.

In 1885, *The Decorator and Furnisher*, in a series of essays about Boston artists' studios, discusses the way high-quality Japanese and Chinese porcelain is displayed: ""You notice there is nothing in the room of a very white tone that is exposed to the light. A bust of Venus, in plaster, is in the dark corner on the piano top, side of it rests a brass tray and nearby is a Ming vase catching the light in silvery spots.""

As Pierson points out, this description is unusual for the time because it doesn't identify the porcelain as a ""Chinese vase"" or ""Old China"" or ""Blue China,"" but literally as a *Ming vase.* This is the period when we start to see people come to think of *the* Ming vase as a particularly high quality piece of art.

Three years later, the *New York Times* publishes its first mention of *the* Ming vase in [a short story entitled (appropriately enough) *The Ming Vase*](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F07EFDB173AEF33A2575AC1A9649C94699FD7CF), which awards that vase special, magical qualities appropriate for the Orientalist beliefs of the period in the West. 

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, ceramics collecting guides [take pains to point out the details of specific kinds of porcelain](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F06E4D6103DEE32A25750C0A9639C946397D6CF), including Ming. Moreover, there's evidence that even though Ming is considered a quality item, it's not beyond the means of particularly focused middle-class buyers or of upper-middle-class buyers (at least in the early stages). In 1886, [there's an account of an 8-inch Ming vase being sold for £13 in London](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9401E5DB133FE533A25750C2A9649D94679FD7CF). 

As Pierson shows, Ming porcelain starts to show up in fiction at the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th century. Edith Wharton's stories are a good example of this. In *The Fruit of the Tree* (published in 1907), there are shorthand references to ""Ming,"" referencing Ming porcelain and thus demonstrating its position as a high-class object. Fascinatingly, Pierson says that there's actually a divide between fiction and reality at this point. Qing porcelain, according to auction records, was fetching higher prices than Ming. 

Discussing [a new show at the Metropolitan Museum in 1916](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=950DE4DE1439E233A25756C0A9659C946796D6CF), the *Times* wrote, ""A very considerable public is acquainted with the polished beauties of Chinese porcelain, but as yet comparatively few have had opportunity to become even superficially familiar with the noble line of Chinese ware antecedent to the true porcelain, although possessing certain of its characteristics. ... When the public learns the game it ardently pursues it, and one may predict in the near future a public hot on the trail of Sung and Tang.""

Instead, it was Ming porcelain that took the title and the public's interest, continuing to feature in popular fiction. In the 1920s, Pierson writes, there are repeated stories about unscrupulous art and antique dealers, mysteries involving murders or crimes targeting the Ming vase, and more. There's *Quinney's Adventures* in 1924, with a story involving a Ming vase fought over by two collectors. The winning collector lords his victory over the other, only to accidentally drop it and shatter it. For many of these stories, the Ming vase takes the role that the Maltese Falcon would hold in Dashell Hammett's eponymous work.

Now, what about the smashing of the Ming vase in comedy? Well, there's nothing particularly unique about the vase in that regard. It's simply a widely known object that's both fragile and valuable. The comedy comes from its accidental destruction. [It might as well be a crystal football](http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/7821303/alabama-crimson-tide-crystal-bcs-trophy-shattered-mishap). As Pierson writes, ""By 1968, it had become a widespread literary and colloquial stereotype for something rare, precious, priceless, elegant or sophisticated.""

654,AskHistorians,"Did people in the past really have more leisure time than we do today? If so, when did this start to change?","This is a fascinating, but complicated question. It forces us to narrow down the inquiry to specific times and places, because it's impossible to generalize the entire medieval period - certainly a person might have *less work* at the height of the black plague but that might not mean *leisure time*, I'm sure you'll agree! - and the same must be said of the early modern period - however you may define it - and even post-industrialization, there were large variations in times and place.

On the whole, it *does* seem that free time or leisure for an average worker has been reduced, generally, from the medieval period to the modern day, but not in a strictly linear progression. There have been estimates that present the average hours of work done per year per average male worker in particular centuries. There are variations throughout the centuries, for instance the average hours put in in the 13th century are higher than those in the 14th, but the estimate given, assuming at least a 9.5 hour work day working 2/3s of the year across the whole medieval period in the UK is given as 2309 hours per year. From 1400-1600, the average is given as 1980 hours. 

There are of course exceptions to this model: James E. Thorold Rogers in [*Six Centuries of Work and Wages*](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924002283079&view=1up&seq=1) argues that, at least in the 13th century, artisans worked a day likely no longer than 8 hours, with enough spare time that there's evidence that these artisans supplemented their income and subsistence with wage agricultural work, and even sold some of their produce to their artisan bosses. Later, in the 17th century, he puts the work day at between 12-14 hours. So again, this is likely not a simple linear progression.

However, the cumulative change is still striking: the average yearly hourly load number nearly *doubles* by 1840, to between 3100-3600 hours, based on a *70 hour* week. The average for the United States is comparable.

Why the enormous change?

You've alluded to it in your OP: industrialization. Agriculture, for centuries, had been the primary production economy in western Europe, but but the 1820s and roaring on until the end of the century, American and British manufacturers would take a larger and larger slice of the pie. This has been exhaustively studied, not simply because the hours of the workweek rose, but because the shift from an agricultural to a maufacturing economy changed nearly *everything* about your average worker's life. It changed the nature of their education, the food they ate, *how* they ate it, it changed the idea of the home, the idea of the family, the idea of holidays, the idea of their power in an economic relationship, it changed their politics, it changed their *militia requirements*, it changed ideas about sex and sexuality, about worship and entertainment and I am not exaggerating when I say it changed *everything*. One of the classic works that discusses this enormous multifacteted process is Charles Sellers' *The Market Revolution.* Sellers is not perfect and in some respects the work is dated, and it's cheerfully devoted to specifically *American* changes of the Industrial Revolution, but it's a good start. He sums up a vast amount of conflict thusly:

> Profound cultural differences arose from these contrasting modes of production. The market fostered individualism and competitive pursuit of wealth by open-ended production of commodity values that could be accumulated as money. But rural production of use values stopped once bodies were sheltered and clothed and bellies provided for. Surplus produce had no abstract or money value, and wealth could not be accumulated. Therefore the subsistence culture fostered family obligation, communal cooperation, and reproduction over generations of a modest comfort.

Part of what Sellers is loosely describing here is what economists call a backward-bending supply curve of labor; basically, when wages rise or needs are met, workers *stop working*. The thought of doing that today, of going to our boss and saying ""hey, I've done a lot of good work today, I'm going to head out"" at noon, even if we *have* done a day's worth of work, is profoundly alien to most of us. But this is a process that has been noted, and it was complained about by early capitalists and industrialists, and even has historical precedents in guild systems and others. Essentially, one of the major changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution was instituting a system where workers had no power to withhold their labor. It was a long, messy process the specifics of which are beyond the scope of the question, but while I may have implied above that this was done by greedy mustachioed factory barons plotting alongside bought-and-paid-for politicians, the truth was far more often that converging aspects of the new economy presented opportunities that capitalists (the definition of capitalist I'm using here is the open and intentional union of the *ownership class* with the political class, not simply the rich - capitalism is the union of political power with property power) were more than happy to take advantage of.

So what were these old freedoms that workers had? For one thing, holidays. But the erosion of the church-calendar year was already ongoing by the time floor bosses clocked their workers at the steel mill, *that* was a process jumpstarted by the Reformation and the chipping away of the dominance of the Catholic church. The medieval calendar year had, according to Francis and Joseph Gies, thirty or so holidays in the year. Some of those were multi-day, multi-stage holidays that allowed people to celebrate for days in a row. The conception of time implied by many medieval writings was one that counted time between holidays, or dated events to their proximity to a holiday. In the 16th century work of the ""poor knight"" Gotz von Berlichingen, for instance, he gives the date of the day that he lost his hand to a cannoball ""the day after the feast of St. Jacob,"" and remembers that it was a sunday, but he doesn't give a calendar date. 

Some of these holidays also had deliberate and tolerated subversions of rules, both of polite society and of political power. ""Topsy-turvy"" or ""world turned upside down"" themes reigned in holidays like All Fool's Day, and allowed poorer folks to prank or make jokes of their betters. But even a more casual relationship often ruled the notion of work. A 16th century curmudgeon, the Bishop of Durham James Pilkington, wrote of the work ethic he observed:

> The labouring man will take his rest long in the morning; a good piece of the day is spent afore he come at his work; then he must have his breakfast, though he have not earned it at his accustomed hour, or else there is grudging and murmuring; when the clock smiteth, he will cast down his burden in the midway, and whatsoever he is in hand with, he will leave it as it is, though many times it is marred afore he come again; he may not lose his meat, what danger soever the work is in. At noon he must have his sleeping time, then his bever in the afternoon, which spendeth a great part of the day; and when his hour cometh at night, at the first stroke of the clock he casteth down his tools, leaveth his work, in what need or case soever the work standeth.

Guild journeymen of the Holy Roman Empire in the same century had a tradition they called *Guter Montag* or Good Monday: their masters would allow, and sometimes even pay for, a bout of monday-afternoon drinking. Every monday. Post-industrial writers cite this as evidence of the poor work ethic and of the inherent laziness of the worker before the industrial economy forced them into stricter discipline, which is an idea of course that has a lot of problematic aspects to our relationship with work today.

We see in various parts of the economy methods by which workers challenged unfair or overbearing bosses. Wage laborers often simply left the job if they felt that they were not respected. Michael Behaim, an apprentice clerk in the 1520s, wrote to his guardian of his master taking advantage of him, and using him as a mere shop-sweeper, instead of properly teaching him the trade. His guardian eventually found him better employment elsewhere. Petty suits between apprentices or journeyman and their masters, and vice versa, were commonplace. Some wage laborers expected not only a day's pay, but midday breaks and a meal, and we have records of complaints when the meal is tawdry or the break is short, or even that their supplied tools are in poor condition, etc. Peasants were expected, sometimes, to work a number of days on their lord's property, and the demand for their proper recompense, in kind or pay, was loud and often belligerent.

Juliet Schor even argues that within the past two or three decades, the relationship between the worker and the workplace, the expectation of work and productivity, has changed even more, and that Americans are working more with less leisure than similar jobs had in the 60s or before.

To give a long, long story a short summation: yeah, it seems like modern folks work longer for less leisure than at many times and places in the past, but the more compelling observation, in my opinion, is the erosion of the ability to wield power in the workplace. Wage conditions and contract work in boilerplate leave little room for what a 16th century journeyman or even a 14th century farmer might expect as their just treatment, and the tools for hitting back today are curtailed, legally and culturally. But we should bear in mind that this is not universal, and work-conditions even just limited to a few centuries in Europe fluctuate widely.

656,AskHistorians,"In 1950, Argentina and Venezuela were one of the richest countries in the world with GDP per capita on par with Western Europe. How did they see such sharp declines in their relative positions over the course of the 20th century?","I am not very knowledgeable about Argentina but as a Venezuelan that's currently researching my country's history in depth, in particular economic history, I may be able to answer about it.

To understand Venezuela, you must understand its oil industry. By the turn of the 20th century, Venezuela was politically unstable and heavily indebted. A civil war and skirmishes with local *caudillos* made the country a hot mess to rule over, and political and economical growth was going slowly.

Enter Juan Vicente Gomez. Second-in-command for President Cipriano Castro, he seized power from him in 1908 as the latter went abroad for surgery. And until his death in 1935, he oversaw the change from a crop-based economy to an oil-exporting one, and it would remain as such till today. He was the first one to direct the oil revenues to modernization and infrastructure development, while taking a large cut for himself and his cronies. The concession-based model for mining and oil extraction that would last until the 1970s, along with minuscule taxation, allowed the foreign companies to take abroad most of the profits from the oil.

Although the Natives and Spaniards knew about the presence of oil beneath the surface thanks to oil seeps, industrial drilling did not take place until the 1910s, due to an increased demand from industrialization and the advent of the internal combustion engine. And in 1922, the oil well Barroso II blew out, spewing a hundred thousand barrels of oil per day for nine days into the air, which was a wonderful PR move by the oil to announce its bountiful presence, and a beacon for foreign companies (i.e. Shell, Esso, British Petroleum) to start large-scale drilling and, soon, refining. In less than a decade, Venezuela would become the third largest oil producer, and largest exporter, in the world.

As mentioned before, the State did not really partake on this bonanza, making most of its income by selling concessions to drill. Political pressures towards democracy and a fair share of the revenues had to wait until Gomez's death in 1935. The country began a slow transition towards democracy and in 1943, it was codified into Law that the State would receive half of the profits from the oil industry. An even bigger share meant larger projects, and with the advent of the first truly democratic government of Romulo Gallegos in 1948, the country was already planning or working on massive public projects: [Caracas' University City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_City_of_Caracas), [housing and government offices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tczq1mvStU0), [industrial development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSm9cA5tGA), [bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Rafael_Urdaneta_Bridge)...

Around this time, a military government by Marcos Perez Jimenez took hold, ruling between 1952-1958. Oil revenue was essentially unchanged, but modernization and development became a matter of prestige and national security. Also around this time, there was a serious discussion on what to do with the oil revenue. Ultimately the ""Sowing the Oil"" concept, developed by Arturo Uslar Pietri, dominated. That means that the best way to invest the oil revenue was to invest in the people and the country; via the aforementioned massive public projects but also funding public education, healthcare, and culture, as well as working to export refined goods and not crude oil, and invest on other industries (most notably steel).

By 1961, with democracy properly restored, the country was prosperous. ~~A few years before, the Venezuelan Bolivar was the highest valued currency in the world.~~ ^^1 A welfare state was in place, ensuring the oil revenues were distributed among the people. Politically, a two-party system took hold, which did not allow for much change. And collusion between the parties, as well as the ridiculous amount of state revenue, allowed corruption and inefficiency to flourish. But as long as the oil kept flowing, this could be maintained, and the people were happy.

In 1976, oil was fully nationalized, and PDVSA, the State's oil company, began operations. Venezuela was known at this time as the ""Saudi Venezuela"", with a high quality of life and an enviable position in Latin America. But shortly thereafter, in the 1980s oil glut, coupled with mismanagement, inefficiency, and corruption, as well as a political desire to keep the welfare state in place, led to bad fiscal and economic policies such as devaluing and fixing an exchange price for the Bolivar and ballooning public debt. The system was unsustainable, and the situation worsened until the nation required a bailout from the IMF. This proved wildly unpopular, and led to [massive protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracazo), [two coup attempts and an impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_presidency_of_Carlos_Andr%C3%A9s_P%C3%A9rez) and, ultimately, inflation and worsening economic conditions that led to the rise of Hugo Chavez in 1998.

This basically covers 20th century Venezuela. I highly recommend watching the three-part [El Reventon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s55LNl_Q3U4) documentary about the Venezuelan oil history, if you can find it in English. For a more general Latin American woes, including Argentina, [Open Veins of Latin America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Veins_of_Latin_America) is great for history, but... iffy on economic theory. For a more economic view, [Guide for the Perfect Latin American Idiot](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Perfect-Latin-American-Idiot/dp/156833236X) is a direct counter for the economic theory on that book, and I believe the two ought to be read together.

657,AskHistorians,Was suicide a common issue in the Middle Age?,"[1/2]

*I'm borrowing some pieces from earlier answers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/43u90l/how_prevalent_was_suicide_in_medieval_europe/czl6tlw/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/50zlpb/were_the_bodies_of_suicide_victims_decapitated_in/d789rbw/), but it's mostly new.*

It's impossible to calculate the rate at which medieval people in the Latin West killed themselves or tried to. First, for the usual reasons--lack of records, bias of records that do survive in favor of focus on specific groups, the sketchily-drawn nature of calculating medieval demographics in general. Equally important, however, are the immense social, legal, and Christian religious consequences not just for the ones who killed themselves, but for those staring numbly at their loved one's body. While we can't say ""how commonly did medieval people kill themselves,"" it is evident that suicide was not only a common problem for survivors, but became an even bigger emotional burden over the course of the Middle Ages.

The central drumbeat of any examination of suicide in the Christian Middle Ages must be: suicide was a sin. And not just any sin, but an absolutely, fundamentally unforgiveable one. It was understood that the act of self-murder was the last thing that a person would do; there was no time for confession and absolution. No cleansing purgatorial fire awaited those who killed themselves: they were eternally bound to hell. As early as 570, Gregory of Tours writes that the body of a nobleman who had killed himself was taken to a monastery by his survivors, but the monks could ""not put [him] among the Christian dead, and no Mass was sung for him."" The refusal of burial with the Christian community in consecrated ground is an earthly symbol of the theological belief that the count was separated from the Christian community in the afterlife.

This story shows us two further things. First, the intimate relationship of suicide and death means the theology of suicide was doctrine that wrapped itself around every level of Christian society. Even if not every single person over a thousand year span was excited to hear every last sermon or could recite the Paternoster (prayer) without prompting at their goddaughter's baptism, everyone dealt with death, whose aftermath was the domain of God and the Church.

Second, it shows the desperation of the count's family. They still took his body to the monastery even knowing he had killed himself, holding out some shard of hope for his soul, that the holy men might still be able to help. Already in the earliest years of the Middle Ages, we witness the desperation of the survivors.

The fallout of this desperation--even a generalized sadness of pious writers upset at the consignment of *any* soul to hell--permeates the medieval source record on suicide. As with Gregory, it's not that suicide isn't mentioned. We hear about it in monastic chronicles: a 12th century monk and prior of Le Dale monastery named Henry fell in love with a local woman and, officially absent from his house to earn money for it, moved in with her. When his affair was discovered and he was forced to return to the convent, ""Taking guidance from the Devil he got into a hot bath and opened veins in both arms; and by way of spontaneous, or rather foolish, death he put an end to life."" From late medieval England, we have cases mentioned in coroners' rolls: A man sentenced to sit in the stocks overnight is found dead in the morning, having stabbed himself. 

Miracle stories attached to saints and shrines describe people who attempted suicide, maybe even appeared to have killed themselves, but were (literally) miraculously revived: a young woman was raped repeatedly by her uncle, who forced her to have an abortion each time she became pregnant. The third time, she did so directly, by ripping open her stomach with a knife. But when she cried to the Virgin Mary--here as both mother and *mediatrix*--Mary healed her external as well as internal wounds, and the woman took vows in a Cistercian convent to spend the rest of her days in praise of Mary/out of sight of mainstream society. And fictional literary sources talk of suicide, too: Boccaccio's *Elegy of Lady Fiammetta* describes a woman who decides to kill herself by jumping from a tower, because the people who find her body won't be able to tell whether it was suicide or an accident.

But in these stories, a clear pattern emerges: an emphasis on secrecy, privacy, and shame. A traveler who drops back from the group; a nun who barricades herself into a room for ""private prayer"" but slips out the window. Fiammetta (who is ultimately rescued) wanted to camouflage her death as an accident; the noblewoman in Gerard of Frachet's miracle tale hid herself away in the aftermath.

This only increases as one moves up the social scale in considering cases. Although typically we'd say the source record is *radically* denser for religious and the upper class than the small but growing middle class and peasants, with suicide this is not so. Alexander Murray, who composed the most important study of suicide in the Middle Ages (and to give you an idea of the weight of this project: he only ever made it through two volumes of a planned three before it was too much), instead says we must look to ""whispers"". 

The sources ideologically and personally closest to a named noble or royal will shy away from mentioning suicide or suicidal ideation; those further removed in time and alliance will be less reticent.  One example of this in operation is the possible attempted suicide of Henry IV, 11th (mostly) century Holy Roman Emperor. A lot of chronicles discuss his wars with the pope and his own son. But it is only one account, by known opponent Bernold of Constance, who includes this detail:

> He betook himself to a castle and there remained without any regal trappings. He was in a state of extreme dejection and, as they say, he tried to give himself over to death, but was prevented by his men and could not bring his wish to effect. *(trans. Murray)*

While the modern reader will recongize circumstances of deep depression and suicidal desire that feel all too familiar, there is an even darker angle in play. A given ""mental illness"" is of course a name attached of a web of symptoms that frequently travel together, manifesting slightly differently in all cases; but even the concept of *illness* is a cultural-scientific attachment. *Tristitia*, *acedia*, *melancholia*, and their fellows in medieval writings appear to aligns with different manifestations of what we call major depressive disorder today. But in the Middle Ages, they were sins. Even before one stepped onto the tower window ledge or threw the rope over the rafters, sorrow over worldly matters like *your own son leading an armed rebellion against you, nbd* was a sin that divorced you from other people and from God. It's not an accident that so many accounts of suicide attribute the act to possession by the devil or the influence of demons, and describe the victim's diabolical fear or behavior in the days or years beforehand.

It's no wonder, then, that even an anti-Henry partisan like Bernold can only bring himself to write ""As they say"" (*aiunt*). It's a common pattern. Dante Alighieri refused to identify thirteenth-century king Henry Hohenstaufen as one of the inmates of the seventh circle of hell in *Inferno*, despite rumors to the effect he was among those violent against themselves. It's not agreement or disagreement with this decision that is picked up by commentators, it's the *debate*: ""but others write,"" hedges Bevenuto da Imola, and ""if this is true."" 

There was good reason for those left behind to be cautious. As laws and legal systems coalesced over the course of the Middle Ages, death by suicide came to have extensive legal consequences for one's heirs (and whatever a grudge against the dead, might not be good to antagonize the living). Laws permitted or mandated the ""ravage"" of the property of someone who committed suicide: that its, its seizure by the lord or city rather than passing down to one's heirs. This could extend all the way to the home that a house-owner's family was *still living in*, throwing them onto the street. 

A 1280 case from England illustrates these laws in action. Upon the death of one of his tenants, a lord had claimed it was suicide and thus her property reverted to him. Her heirs had sued to get the property back, claiming his ""presumptions"" were (a) wrong and (b) even if they were right, presumptions weren't strong enough to be evidence of suicide. Notably, the judge ruled in the lord's favor because one of the 'presumptions' was the dead woman's threat to do something to shame her friends. Suicide was shameful for the immediate victim, but it also smade victims of the survivors who had to deal with public shame and material loss in the midst of private grief."
658,AskHistorians,"How did Medieval armies tell which side a soldier was on? How common was it for a soldier to be killed by someone in his own army, being mistaken for an enemy?","The Middle ages (and the earliest Modern period that followed) was an era before uniforms as we understand them. Compared to say, the 18th century, there wasn’t a standardized, color-coded way to tell friend from foe. Instead, there were a variety of kinds of battlefield identifications used in different times and places in the medieval era to identify individuals, groups within an army, and armies. Because I study the later Middle Ages, I will discuss the period from around 1250 through 1500 or so. I will leave it to others to discuss battlefield identification in the early and high middle ages.

Battlefield identification had always been an issue. In the 13th century, the introduction of closed-faced [helms](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Topfhelm_DHM_transparent.png) made personal identification on the battlefield and in the tournament even more difficult. While older scholarship mentions helms as the impetus for crests and heraldry, more recent work questions this -  schemes to identify knights existed prior to closed-faced helmets. That said, in the 13th century means of identification became much, much more common. In the late 12th and 13th century, two ways of identifying individual soldiers developed. The first was heraldric surcoats and shields - coloring the surcoat (the loose robe worn over the armour in the 13th and 14th centuries) and shield with specific colors in specific patterns to identify a particular man at arms. The systems of heraldry is much more complicated than this, and relates to the construction of the knight as a social identity in the 13th and 14th century, but the battlefield/tournament use is still important to remember. The second was the [crest](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/KHM_Wien_B_74_-_Great_helm_of_Albert_von_Prankh,_14th_century,_front.jpg), a sculpted ‘topper’ for the helm generally made of parchment or leather. The design on this would often be somehow identifying, though it was not necessarily related to the user’s heraldry. Finally, in the 14th and 15th centuries as plate armour developed armour itself was decorated in ways that were individualized (for those who could afford it). The Black Prince’s Guantlets had gadlings (brass knuckles, basically) in the shape of a lion, one of the animals emblematic of the English monarchy. In the Early modern period, armour decoration became more developed - the armour of say, Otto Heinrich, Count Palatinate of the Rheine, was gold and black, to match his colors. Charles V had his armour decorated with the symbols of his domains - primarily Burgundy (and more specifically, the Low Countries, which he had inheritted from the Duchy of Burgundy). Such decorated armour would help identify its wearers to friends (so that they could rally to defend them) and foes (so that they would know to capture them alive).

The effect of this was that an individual man at arms could now be identified by those who knew his crest and heraldry or his armour - such as by people who knew him personally, people fighting next to him, or (as the system of heraldry developed) professional heralds. However, since they are individual identification neither crests nor heraldric colors helps identify which side someone is on unless you know which side he is on, indvidually. That said, heraldry and crests served another important role - when soldiers were captured for ransom, it allowed their easy identification. It also allowed for the identification of the dead after battle (assuming that the corpses had not already been stripped, as often happened). 

A solution that we see in the 15th century is the introduction of livery coats to identify the men in a certain lord’s retinue. This is most extensively used in England during the period of the Wars of the Roses. A livery coat was a garment provided by a lord to his retainers (contracted soldiers) as part of their contract of ‘livery and maintenance’ (along with pay, food and wine/beer). It would be in a specific color, that would not necessarily be related to the Lord’s heraldric colors, and often bear a badge associated with the lord (again, not related to the lord’s heraldry, necessarily). For example, Richard III’s men wore a badge with a boar on it. Wearing livery allowed men to identify the fellow members of their retinue, but didn’t necessarily identify which side every retinue was on.

EDIT: Tobias Capwell has also argued that the decoration on a number of late 15th century painted sallets [like this one](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/a7/bb/c7/a7bbc784097587a05218bfb2643ffccb.jpg) were painted as a form of 'unit identification' by groups of medium cavalryman fighting for the city of Nuremberg. Essentially a group would all have monster faces painted onto their helmets. The evidence is not conclusive, but the idea is evocative at the very least.

Finally, there were army identifiers. Famously, Henry V had the English Army at Agincourt wear the red cross of St George. Similarly, in the late 15th century the Duke of Burgundy had his soldiers wear a red st Andrew’s cross to identify themselves. In [this illumination from a swiss chronicle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Schilling_murten_bern.jpg
)you can see the soldiers of Burgundy wearing an ‘x’ shaped cross fighting swiss soldiers with a ‘+’ shaped cross, the cross of Switzerland. These army identifiers might be worn on a livery coat, or sewn onto the clothing, or displayed on armour in some way. However, note that the soldiers are not wearing anything resembling a ‘uniform’ - the cross is a modification to their existing clothing, not a uniform garment worn by everyone.

In the end, there was not a uniform (heh) way of identifying one side from the another on the medieval battlefield. Friendly fire incidents did occur - at the Battle of Barnet in 1471 some Lancastrians mistook their own reinforcements for Yorkists, throwing the Lancastrians into disarray as they fought each other. However it should be noted that Barnet was fought in the fog - unusually low visibility for a medieval battle (though Towton 10 years earlier was fought in a snowstorm). Indeed compared with the smoke of an early modern battlefield, visiblity on a medieval battlefield would be relatively clear (though this clarity would decrease as the 15th and 16th centuries progressed). 

It is important to remember that the melee was not necessarily the normal shape of medieval combat. In infantry warfare especially, tight formations were the norm. As Christine de Pisan wrote in 1409 (as quoted in Keen’s ‘Medieval Warfare’): ‘Two great evils can follow from a disordered formation: one is that the enemies can more easily break into it; the other is that the formations may be so compressed that they cannot fight. Thus it is necessary to keep a formation in ranks, and tight and joined together like a wall.’ In this case it would be obvious who your friends were (the man next to you) and who your enemies were (the guy in front of you trying to jab a pike into your face). Contemporary military historians do not necessarily think of pre-modern battles as bloodthirsty free-for-alls, but instead a series of attacks and counter-attacks that could at times seem quite furtive as each side sought to maintain their cohesion and exploit any weaknesses of the enemy. That said, there were times - when cavalry charged, when reinforcements arrived, or when a group of men fled, that things could get quite chaotic. Then a badge of your army or lord might help you...or it might not.

659,AskHistorians,"Rome still survives, almost three millenia after its founding. Tenochtitlan was destroyed, and Mexico City was built in its place. What's the difference in practice?","With around 2000 years of history behind these two cities, there is a lot to be said on the topic, so I will try my best to answer your question directly. 

The biggest difference between Rome and CDMX (Mexico City, DF, Tenochtitlan, etc) is that Rome has a continuous through-line of cultural and political influence, and a large part of that is due to the Papacy. While Rome has been sacked and changed hands politically in some sense, there has been a continuous Roman (Latin) culture that has predominated for most of its history. 

On the other hand, Mexico City was obviously taken by conquest, and the socio-political landscape of the city and country was completely overhauled. To put it briefly (because you seem to be more interested in the physical and architectural landscape of the city), when Cortes finally conquered Tenochtitlan, he instituted a Hispanicized Mexico that has continued to this day, where an event like this has not quite happened in Rome throughout its history. 

However, Mexico City's landscape shares similarities to Rome in terms of its ancient ruins. While there is no Colosseum dominating the visual landscape, there is just as much, if not more, ruins of the Great Pyramid as the Roman Forum. When Cortes took over the city, he, like many conquerers (include the religious ones that re-appropriated Roman temples), converted Mexica temples into churches, destroyed cultural artifacts, and even used the stones from Moctezuma's palace to build his own. We can make a direct spiritual connection between the Popes stripped Roman marble off of temples to build their Catholic churches, and temples such as the Pantheon converting to places of Catholic worship. Cortes kept the general layout of the Aztec city, and so walking its streets from the Zocalo to Chapultepec, you can easily imagine a Mexica reality to its urban landscape. 

What's interesting about Mexican history and cultural identity is that there is differing viewpoints on how to view Mexico as a nation. To your very last question, some Mexicans--including historians--would answer in the affirmative. Cortes had mestizo children, physically and symbolically ushering in a new ""people."" As preivously mentioned, the Zocalo's layout matches that of Moctezuma's city. Chapultepec Castle has defended the city from an ancient spiritual hill. The Basílica de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe is built as a pilgrimage site where Indian Juan Diego saw an apparition of the Virgin Mary and converted to Christianity. Hell, they even NAMED the city after the people, as Mexico is the Hispanicized Mēxihcah. 

Thus, there are many who see Mexico City, as a metonym for Mexico at large, AS a continuation of indigenous culture. The city itself, while only settled about 200 years before Cortes' arrival, perhaps carries just as much of an ancient spirit as Rome does, although I am not nearly as studied on Italy as I am Mexico. As a personal anecdote (and therefore to be taken with a grain of salt), I find being in CDMX very similar to being in Rome in terms of what you're asking. 

In sum, viewing Tenochtitlan as a past reality and Rome as a continuous entity might be white-washing the issue a bit. Romans also have a bit more comfort with its evolution than Mexicans do; however, there remains a great deal of pride and acknowledgement of influence in Tenochtitlan. To put it simply, there is a LOT of Tenochtitlan in CDMX.

EDIT: Since I got here first and am the top post due to how Reddit karma works, let me add some addenda and clarifications from the conversation that has sprung from this: 

1. In this post I advocate for seeing post-conquest Mexico City as a continuation of pre-conquest civilization, not as a ""clean break."" I do believe it is important to acknowledge just how life-altering conquistador occupation of Tenochtitlan was, however. While indigenous culture prevailed in numerous ways for centuries, a centralized political power remained in the hands of the Spanish, and so this collision of cultures (resulting in the social interactions of the three social classes that resulted from that collision) completely changed the city forever, to say the least. This plays out differently for different cities and regions in Mexico at this time, but that is beyond the scope of this thread. 

2. Cortes razed the city to the ground, as u/Mictlantecuhtli points out, yet much of the surroundings of the Zocalo were rebuilt in indigenous fashion, as u/611131 points out. While this juxtaposition of Spanish and indigenous culture played out practically in the streets of the city, what we see develop over the next few centuries is an interesting interaction and mixture of these two cultures, as u/drylaw outlines. Go check out those posts for more detail!

660,AskHistorians,"How is it that I can mostly read ""The Canterbury Tales"" in the original, but ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,"" written at roughly the same time and in the same country, is mostly unintelligible?","There are two major factors governing the linguistic difficulty of *Gawain* as opposed to *Canterbury Tales*: dialect and poetry form. Chaucer is planted firmly in the world of the London clerical bureaucracy, clerks writing first and foremost for a ""reading circle"" type audience of other clerks, whose literary influence through ""reading for fun"" and through essentially running local and national bureaucracy did a lot to standardize the Midland-Kent dialects swirling around London into standard English.

The anonymous *Gawain* poet (usually known as the *Pearl* poet, although there are a few scholars who have questioned whether the two poems were *really* written by the same author), on the other hand, wrote in a northwestern-ish dialect, a version of the West Midlands dialect. That places the vocabulary a step removed from what we know in Chaucer--a step removed from the type of Middle English that would flow into early modern.

The second major factor is the type of verse. *Canterbury Tales* is governed first of all by meter with different rhyming patterns falling at the end of the line. SGGK uses alliterative verse, a specific format heralding back to Old English/Anglo-Saxon heritage that was undergoing a revival in just the part of England where SGGK's dialect places its author. The alliteration demands of alliterative verse not only suggest that a wider vocabulary would be necessary to make the patterns work--we think that using as wide a vocabulary as possible was part of the literary game and fun for authors writing in the style. I wish I remembered the exactly number--I think SGGK uses something like twelve or thirteen different words for ""man."" 

As far as contemporary perceptions of language--yes, medieval people recognized both the general borders of many modern vernacular languages *and* the differences in dialect. Sometimes this is explicit. In mid-14C Germany, Heinrich von Nördlingen wrote to his friend Margaretha Ebner to tell her that he was sending a gift: a book by earlier mystical author Mechthild of Magdeburg. But, Heinrich said, *her* German was difficult so he had had a group of friends translate it into ""our"" German. Mechthild had originally written in Middle Low German (northern); the Bavarian-born Ebner's primary language was Middle High German. (It's tough to say whether medieval Low and High German qualify as ""separate languages""--you can certainly cherry-pick individual texts that seem like it, but they'd be the ends of the spectrum while many people spoken and wrote somewhere in the middle).

The activity of scribes suggests a similar view. Monks and nuns acquiring books for their convents ""translate"" freely from what we would call one dialect to another. They are clearly quite adept with the dialect of their exemplar, but for their own convent, it's easier to pop the text into the local dialect.

Honestly, the biggest difference is just *practice.* SGGK is tough because of the vocabulary (which is apparent already by comparing scholarly translations!), but take something in the middle difficulty range between CT and SGGK--like Piers Plowman B. You're probably going to struggle at the beginning, but by the end, you'll practically be able to speak in Langland's verse and vocabulary."

662,AskHistorians,"How did the Illuminati, a historical liberal Bavarian society, become the catch-all term for secret cabals and conspiracies?","First some background on the political environment at the end of the Eighteenth Century: The actual Illuminati was a group derived from a power struggle among Freemasons in Bavaria in the 1770s. The members of the Illuminati desired to move their Masonic brethren toward the Radical Enlightenment, which promoted democracy, egalitarianism, and spinozist materialism. The Radical Enlightenment was largely unsuccessful in Germany, but radicals did find success in France. The increasingly extreme French revolutionary ideology under the Jacobins made the term “Jacobin” a pejorative throughout Europe and America. Radicals existed elsewhere including the infant United States and Great Britain. Anyone supporting democratic ideas were labeled as Jacobins, and assumed to really want anarchy and atheism.

Conspiracy theories involving the Illuminati became popular in the 1790s. It was in response to the French Revolution. Conservatives, particularly in Britain, used Robespierre’s Reign of Terror to scare the people from considering democratic reform or revolution. Part of their counter-revolutionary argument was a religious appeal. They argued the French revolutionaries dismantling the Catholic Church was fundamentally atheist and even demonic. The Thermidorian Reaction and the French Directory reigned back the revolution, but the conservatives still needed a boogeyman to maintain the fear in the common folk. In 1798, Augustin Barruel, a French Jesuit who had fled to Britain, wrote *Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism*, which described an elaborate conspiracy of several Radical Enlightenment organizations attempting to demolish Western Civilization as they knew it and replace it with a new world order. At the same time, John Robison mirrored Barruel’s assertions with his *Proofs of a Conspiracy Against all the Religions and Governments of Europe*. Also occurring at this time, was the Irish Rebellion which was instigated by the United Irishmen, another secretive organization. Initially, these theories were not taken seriously. The Anti-Jacobin, the most prominent counter-revolutionary periodical in Britain at the time, was dismissive of them. However, only a year later *The Anti-Jacobin Review* (which had succeeded the original *Anti-Jacobin*) was more willing to reference Barruel and Robison. The conspiracy theories became more elaborate to include the Knights Templar and the Occult. Demonic imagery was already being used with the Jacobins so it wasn’t that big of a leap.

I do not know much about the growth of the Illuminati conspiracy theories through the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century, but Eighteenth-Century British propaganda was extremely effective and lasted in our collective cultural memory.

663,AskHistorians,Why did the mafia turn the Stonewall Inn into a gay bar?,"It wasn't just Stonewall. In the 1960s, the Mafia (and specifically the Genovese mob family) was behind pretty much every bar in Manhattan that courted a gay clientele. And it wasn't just $3500 startup--it was $1200 a month after that, to ensure that the police and State Liquor Authority would allow Stonewall to reopen after each very frequent raid.

The repeal of Prohibition may have restored Americans' right to drink alcohol, but municipalities and states found various ways to curtail gay people's ability to drink together in public. In San Francisco, Sal Stoueman's Black Cat Cafe (made particularly famous by Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg) handed out ""I'm A Boy"" nametags to patrons, so undercover cops could not arrest its drag performers, ""gay screaming queens"" (TM Ginsberg), or even ""gray flannel suit types"" for female impersonation with intent to defraud or deceive someone into sex. Los Angeles undercover cops would *count the seconds* they saw people kiss (in greeting, on New Years' Eve, whatever) and arrest or brutalize whatever they considered to transcend the line from celebration to queer. The favored tactic of the New York SLA, of course, was to raid and shutter bars declared ""disorderly,"" such an excellent weasel word.

Things might have reached a breaking point around 1960. Out in California, a group of San Francisco gay bar owners had banded together to go public about the massive bribes they were paying police in order to remain open, the effect being, they exposed significant police corruption. This resulted in the effective closure of SF's 50 or so gay bars--but had ramifications across the country, too. In New York, only one bar managed to survive an initial 1960s shakedown and mass closure.

The *good* half of the story, from there, is that the 1960-61 bar closures marked some of the most important pre-Stonewall gay rights protests and publicly broadcast activism. The Black Cat's famous drag-performing singer, Jose Sarria, was the first openly gay candidate for public office in the US (SF city supervisor). Several bar owners' groups (the Tavern Guild in particular) formed to lobby specifically for the rights of owners to court a gay clientele; even *The Advocate* started publication in response. In New York, a massive group of gay men staged a public protest of, essentially, ""being gay in public"" in midtown until cops and politicians basically allowed bars to operate for a period of time so they would go be queer *out of sight*.

But the earlier entrenched corruption of statutory violation, raid, bribe, reopen cycle became even more vicious in most places. In the 1960s in particular, therefore, the Mafia pretty much made New York's gay bar scene a treasured racket. They charged ridiculous cover fees and generally served cheap, lousy alcohol in exchange for the *masquerade* of protection from police raids. In fact, gay bars were raided as often as ever; just, protection fees like the $1200 Stonewall paid monthly meant the bars would be allowed to reopen afterwards. Stonewall's bribe was particularly high, generally rumored the highest, because of all the other shady business that went on or allegedly went on (blackmail of customers, a prostitution ring, possibly a pedophile ring that accompanied a reputation in the *heterosexual* NY community of Stonewall as a place to go ""tourist slumming."")

Word of mouth that Stonewall (Cherry Lane Theater, Fifth Avenue Bar, etc) were ""periodically safe"" places for gay people to drink and be gay in public was crucial for the Mafia to keep their gay bars profitable, particularly a complete dive like Stonewall for which the space was really the only attraction. 

But it wasn't just a one-way street, obviously. The gay community had its own formal means of communication, like the Mattachine Society's *Gay Scene Guide* that informed readers the Stonewall Inn was one of a very few (maybe the only?) gay bar that allowed dancing and welcomed people obviously dressed in drag or otherwise flouting gender, not just sexuality, norms. The publication itself warned potential patrons that Stonewall was not *safe* (don't give out your real name or address; the bar owners and workers are not on your side, either; the cops *will* raid periodically)--conditions fostered in large part by the mob ownership and oversight.

In the middle of the 20th century, gay bars were a hot moneymaking opportunity for any shady criminal businessman or corrupt cop. In New York, the Mafia took particular control of the situation in the 1960s, including the fateful cultivation of Stonewall into the trashiest yet in some ways most emotionally significant in terms of ""freedoms"" permitted queer-clientele bar in the city.

664,AskHistorians,"Given that Pre-Islamic Arabia was a very women-friendly and sexually ""liberal"" society, what is the source of Islam's extremely puritanical culture?","Hey!

So this has a couple of different parts that I hope to address.  I can't give a super specific answer, but will try to touch on a number of facets you could ask follow-up questions about.  I'm pulling some from previous answers that I have written, but much of this is also new.  A great book on this topic is Leila Ahmed's book *Women and Gender in Islam*, which I will heavily use below.

# Part 1 – Quick Note on Veiling Itself

Because you specifically mentioned it, I wanted to start with a small section on veiling itself.  Veiling was common practice in multiple pre-Islamic societies across the Middle East.  In Assyrian culture wearing a veil separated between a 'respectable' woman and those who were 'up for grabs', so to say.  Upper class women, concubines accompanying those women, and former ""sacred prostitutes"" all had to wear it whereas normal prostitutes and slaves were forbidden from veiling themselves, even so far as being under threat of flogging or having their ears cut off.  Ahmed then writes that this practice spread throughout the upper-class Mediterranean world - from the Levant through to Persia - and also crossed religious lines appearing in Byzantine Christian societies.  Here, Ahmed gives the example of a 10th century Byzantine patriarch who wrote that he only allowed his daughter to go out ""veiled and suitable chaperoned"".  She also notes the reasoning, separating the respectable from the rabble, remains constant even in these other societies.  

However, that is not to say that veiling was necessarily widespread in Arabia itself.  Women of the *jahilyya* pre-Islamic period did not normally don a veil. This of course varied from city to countryside, with cities being more likely to veil.  Overall, nowhere was the veil common to the extent of places like neighboring Syria and Palestine.  As you noted in your question, sexual relations in Arabia were more open than in those other societies, with both polygamy and polyandry being present. 

Through Muhammad's entire life, the only women who were regularly veiled or secluded were his wives. Through successful revelations received by Muhammad, the practice of veiling and seclusion took hold among them, getting to the point where the phrasing ""she took the veil"" became synonymous to ""she became a wife of Muhammad"".  Various impetuses pushed Muhammad towards these rulings.  For example, it was after he became annoyed with guests staying too long chatting with his wives after dinner that the Sura 33 was revealed, within which [verse 54](https://quran.com/33/54) details that one should only speak to Muhammad's wives from behind a curtain. The word he uses for curtain is *ḥijāb*.  Most westerners associate the word *hijab* with some sort of head-wrap of veil, but it also literally can mean 'veil' in the sense of a curtain.  [Verse 59](https://quran.com/33/59) then gives the commandment to women to ""bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused.""  This is allegedly in response to the ""hypocrites"", mere nominal converts to Islam, harassing Muslim women and claiming to have thought they were slaves.  Finally, I should note that the later second Caliph, Omar, was a proponent of seclusion of women and veiling and actively pushed Muhammad towards this position.

# Part 2 – The evolution of the Woman’s place

This is what I suspect to be the more interesting section – why did Islam develop the way it did, when women played such major roles in pre-Islamic and early Islamic times?

In the *jahilyya*, and within early Islam, women contributed in a number of facets of life.  Women were soothsayers and prophetesses such as Sajah, a Christian woman of the Banū Tamīm who led a force of over 4,000 along with Musaylimah, “The Liar”, in rebellion against the nascent Muslim state.  Like the previous sentence indicates, they were also involved in warfare. They were not only poets, telling stories of the battles and engaging in ritualistic pre-battle exchanges of insults, but also warriors themselves. Umm ‘Umara fought at a number of battles alongside men, eventually losing her hand at the Battle of ‘Uqraba in 634.  Women were heavily involved in early Islamic religious life, providing the many of the *hadith* that came to guide religious life.  It was common for them to remarry, showing there to be a lack of stigma against non-virgins, and often they brought significant wealth to these relationships (Muhammad’s first wife, Khadija, was one such widow.  15 years his senior, she was rich enough to allow Muhammad to not have to work, allowing him to instead focus on his spiritual teachings).


#**So why did this begin to change?**

The changes actually started before the spread of Islam, as merchants in urban Arabian cities were increasingly exposed to the norms and cultures of lands with much more rigid gender roles.  This can be seen as an explanation as to why it was the cities, not the countryside, that first adopted veiling.  However, what brought the changes into hyperdrive was the rapid expansion of the early Islamic Empire.  Not only did this bring increased contact with these foreign cultures, but it also brought an influx of slaves, diminishing the bargaining power of even Arab-born women. 

The conquests brought untold wealth to the Arabs.  Even regular soldiers were able to afford slaves, houses, and concubines.  Accordingly, women lost one of their original bargaining chips – the wealth they brought to marriages.  Further, as a condition for surrendering and keeping their place, many Persian and Sassanian nobles converted to Islam. They kept, however, their original cultures.  One of the features that developed around this time was the harem, with a multitude of women being walled off for rich and powerful men, guarded only by Eunuchs.  With easy access to sex slaves, Ahmed argues that the line between “woman” and “object” started to blur.  Men did not need to put up with the demands stipulated by Arab women’s wedding contracts when they had access to sex elsewhere.  Women faced increasingly strict restrictions and were treated increasingly poorly.  Some elite men even went so far as to lament the fact that they had to marry their daughters, as their standards of living would so dramatically fall.  Ahmed included the following poem in her book, written from one noble man to another on the occasion of his daughter’s death.  This did not come from a sense of general misogyny, that daughters were worthless, but rather from the degradations and humiliations their daughters were liable to face.


> To Abu Hasan I offer condolences. 

> At times of disaster and catastrophe 

> God multiplies rewards for the patient. 

> To be patient in misery 

> Is equivalent to giving thanks for a gift. 

> Among the blessings of God undoubtedly 

> Is the preservation of sons 

> And the death of daughters.

But cultural and economic changes are only a portion of the story.  Also in play was the religious framework that marriage operated within. Islamic law works through a local judge, a *Qadi*, issuing a ruling on a specific case so that it is in line with religious teachings (we have to note that there was no separation between the illegal and the immoral, but rather they were the one and the same).  However, while the Qur’an protected women’s rights in a number of areas, judges often interpreted these not as legally binding rules, but rather as binding only upon the individual’s conscience.  So, a man would not be legally bound to treat his 4 wives fairly, even if that is a stipulation within the Qur’an itself. There was, in essence, the loss of many Qur’anic provisions that could protect women.

The 11th century also brought the *Closing of the Gates of Ijtihad*.  That is, Islamic jurisprudence reached a point where they (allegedly) decided that there had been sufficient rulings in the past that any questions which need an answer were answerable, and it is was longer necessary to use independent reasoning to come to new solutions (for more on this, see my answere [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7vynzv/when_and_why_did_muslim_countries_stop_using_the/dtwak37/))

This in essence froze many Islamic teachings. There are 4 main schools of Sunni Islamic thought, and at the point of the closing of the gates of Ijtihad, only the Maliki school allowed for women to obtain a divorce on the grounds of desertion or cruelty. Meanwhile, only the Hanafi school fully enforced marriage contracts that would bind a man to monogamy.  While before the closing of these gates a judge could, theoretically, use his own reasoning to analogize and come to a new ruling, they were now largely bound to *taqlid*, imitation of the past. So, these doctrines, along with countless others controlling women’s lives, ceased to develop at the same speed as before.  That is not to say that women were completely locked out, as one could effectively “shop” between the different schools of thought for the most favorable ruling.

There is much, much more one could write on this topic, but I unfortunately have work that I have to do.  I hope this can help begin to answer your question, and if you have follow-ups I’ll try to respond if possible."
665,AskHistorians,"In 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed, the Soviet archives were opened and historians had access to a lot of previously secret information. Did anything found in the archives radically change the perception historians had of certain events? Did they find anything new they had never known about before?","I can speak for the history of WWII, but boy did it ever.

&#x200B;

The historiography of WWII has had some serious issues over the years.  The official history of the war written by the Americans was informed by none other than former OKH chief, Franz Halder.  The 1950 combat infantry manual for the US Army that talked about Soviet fighting capabilities was HEAVILY informed by the Germans... and so was popular history.  Halder has his diary, and Heinz Guderian and Erich von Manstein wrote memoirs that were widely published in the West by the 1950's.

&#x200B;

The large histories of the 1960's and 1970's suffered from having access to German memoirs and remembrances, but not always their sources if they were captured by the Soviets or destroyed.  Soviet sources were hidden and Soviet writings and memoirs had some serious issues:

&#x200B;

1. Censorship.  Soviet Marshall Georgi Zhukov once had the word ""rout"" censored to ""withdrawal.""  A picture from Stalingrad showing Chuikov's 62nd Army staff gathering and laughing as a man held a machine gun... well that was actually a puppy.  Things like that happened all the time and it meant that information was either untrustworthy, OR
2. The West didn't trust Soviet sources.  A CIA paper written in the late 1950's titled ""Caeser X 59"" basically disregards most earlier writings and only then starts to trust sources from the Soviets.  The CIA had a unique take because
3. Translation.  Not every important Russian/Soviet source made it to the West.

&#x200B;

As such, there are issues that plague histories that rely on the Germans and sparsely on the Soviets.  Here are just a few examples.

&#x200B;

Second Kharkov and the Donbas Campaign.  Reading Alan Clark's Barbarossa (first published in 1965), it seems like the Soviets learned in the Spring/Summer 1942 how to retreat and withdraw before being encircled.  There is now serious doubt that this was the case.  Internal documents (Glantz and the first book in the Stalingrad trilogy has a lot on this) shows that these withdrawals were often piecemeal and against orders from Stavka (Soviet High Command).  Veteran testimony that has come out recently sure talks about morale issues and retreats and a shattered army.  This is all new.

&#x200B;

We now have documents showing that Chuikov tried to move the HQ of the 62nd Army to the East bank of the Volga... twice.  This is laid out in a book that is really high on Chuikov (Michael K. Jones - Stalingrad: How the Red Army Triumphed).

&#x200B;

Speaking of Stalingrad.  What a good example of how Stalin and the Red Army learned how to attack at one place at one time.  Right?  I mean, we have internal cables from Zhukov telling officers how to fight in the Winter of 1941-1942 (he literally had to tell officers that they should use recon, then air, then artillery, then have more dudes than the enemy, check Glantz - When Titans Clashed, stuff like that which could be embarrassing to the Red Army is far more widely available now).  Anyway, Operation Uranus wasn't the only attack.  The Soviets had multiple operations around Rzhev that led to hundreds of thousands of casualties... each.  These were, by and large, lost to history until Russian historians got access to the archives and the West got access to them.

&#x200B;

The Purges are being reconsidered.  I would read Richard Overy ""Russia's War,"" but new numbers post archives show that the Red Army officer corps was larger than we thought and that more men were let out of prison and back into the army than we thought (think Rokossovsky).

&#x200B;

Some historians think that Lend-Lease was FAR more important than previously thought.  Jonathon House, using post-archive numbers puts the number of American trucks up to 500,000.  He argues that Kursk would not be possible without US help, adding years to the length of the war.  Albert Weeks ""Russia's Lifesaver"" brings some of those Russian numbers to an English translation if you want to check them out.  I find the book not super useful, but the figures are nice.

&#x200B;

You get chilling internal memos like the NKVD records from the Winter War against Finland.  When they were considering how to re-write infantry manuals after losing tens of thousands of men, one commissar noted that they needed to start training men how to go to ground under fire (Catherine Merridale - Ivan's War), yeah... crazy stuff.

&#x200B;

David Glantz is probably the go-to on this for a Western reader.  His Stalingrad series uses Soviet and German records to painstakingly detail the day by day order of battle and location of the units as the battle unfolds.  Reading that can show that they often disagreed on what units were where (like Stalingrad, Chuikov gave the Germans two divisions that weren't actually present).

&#x200B;

I'm sure I'm leaving stuff out, it would be impossible not to, but this gives you an idea of some of the things going on in the historiography.

&#x200B;

I recommend listening to dudes smarter than myself on the matter: (all of these lectures are available on Youtube)

666,AskHistorians,Did Native Americans have any myths/beliefs about what existed beyond the Atlantic/Pacific ocean?,"Absolutely! And I know that I've actually answered this question before, but can't seem to find the link.

The easy answer is yes, they definitely did.  Alaskan Eskimos in fact remained aware of the other side of the Berring Strait - i.e. it was a body of water that they crossed at times, the same would be true of Inuit living at the Eastern end of the Arctic - Greenland was definitely a known place ""across"" the Atlantic from them.

I don't know much about Eastern North America, or much about South and Central American Indigenous histories (besides bits and pieces like Viracocha leaving and crossing the Pacific), but I do know that in the Pacific Northwest there are stories of crossing the Pacific, circling the Pacific, or of people coming from across the Pacific.

Part of many origin stories for different lineages begin with a journey to the lands of the copper, abalone, and so on. These aren't always in the same place, sometimes the copper is in the far north, other times it is across the sea, or even to the East.  In the Nuxalk story of the Salmon boy there is a good example of at least one of these stories.  The Salmon boy and his brother travel to the west, visiting in turn various lands of the fish people which are located out across the open sea, where the salmon people live, who wear salmon skin clothing (McIlwraith ""The Bella Coola Indians"" and oral stories).  This always makes me think of the Ainu, indigenous Japanese who did wear salmon-skin clothing, but the chances are that this story has more to do with the order of fish arriving in the spring.

Then there are other stories that are more historical. There's a story recorded by Cliff Kopas (also a story about the Bella Coola Valley) where it talks of canoes who arrive in the valley, with people in them who wear grass clothing.  They stay for several years, then return to where they came from.

I have several personal accounts of Nuxalk people who say that they have met Pacific Islanders who have the opposite story in their lineages, but have yet to find an independent source for it, but between this and the theories of Thor Heyerdahl (who spent time in Bella Coola during the war) regarding connections between the area and New Zealand, the nation here has developed quite a strong relationship with several communities in New Zealand, resulting in a number of marriages and large group trips."
667,AskHistorians,What kind of a woman would a peasant man in 17-19th century Europe find physically attractive?,"Unfortunately, I’m not a historian and I won’t be able to give you a broad answer to your question, but I do know about Irish folk songs, many of which date back to the 19th century or earlier. Also, since folk music was and still is performed at local celebrations like weddings or religious holidays, it reflects the tastes, if not the exact words, of everyday people.

Many songs specifically celebrate a “colleen” (from the Gaelic cailin, literally meaning “young girl”), who is a “country/peasant girl…associated with a rural landscape and way of life” (O’Conner, 2009). Take these lyrics from “Star of the County Down,” for instance:

From a boreen green came a sweet colleen  
And she smiled as she passed me by.  
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet  
To the sheen of her nut brown hair.  

In general, there is an emphasis on the beauty of the woman’s hair or eyes. Two other good examples are “The Black Velvet Band”:

Her eyes they shown like diamonds  
I thought her the queen of the land  
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder  
Tied up with a black velvet band  

And, “The Rose of Tralee”:

She was lovely and fair as the rose of the summer,  
Yet 'twas not her beauty alone that won me;  
Oh no, 'twas the truth in her eyes ever dawning,  
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee.  

So, what general trends about beauty might you be able to draw from these examples? 

The descriptions tend to be metaphorical and naturalistic, connecting the woman and the landscape (“rose of the summer,” “queen of the land”). Also, the songs often emphasize that the women are from a specific place in Ireland – County Down is in Northern Ireland and Tralee is in County Kerry in Southwestern Ireland. I think this adds a patriotic flavor – these women are beautiful because they represent Ireland itself, forming a “national feminine ideal” (O’Conner, 2009). 

Therefore, the peasant man in your question may not have been pressured to value a narrow physical “type” of woman. Instead, he may have enjoyed praising beautiful women through song, or connecting specific women that he loved in his life to beauties described in song or to his love for his homeland.

668,AskHistorians,How have Americans become so prudish toward sexuality yet so open to violence?,"There is no simple answer to this, no one single factor in American history and culture which can account for such broad trends. The roots of them go back to the cultures of the original colonies, as maintained, modified, and overthrown by every subsequent generation and every wave of immigrants. But I can talk about a small, representative slice of Americana, and how censorship was applied there.

Pulp magazines emerged at the turn of the century from the dime novels and nickel weekly magazines. Their contents reflected the tastes of the day, and ran the gamut from the sedate to the risque, from the action-filled western and crime stories to the intellectual and philosophical. The early pulps catered to a broad audience of all ages and walks of life; anyone that could afford the dime or quarter was welcome to buy them at any newsstand.

There were limits on the content; mostly imposed by editors' individual tastes. While an early pulp might contain an artistic nude or a vicious villain, risque jokes for the college set, none of the publishers wished to run afoul of charges for obscenity (which, being broadly defined in the 1920s, could apply for gore as well as sex) that might get them arrested - or worse, lose them mailing and distribution privileges.

Such concerns were real: the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice was an active force in censorship in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, all the way until 1950. They targeted works of literature such as James Joyce's *Ulysses* (1922), pornographic Tijuana bibles, works on birth control, collections of ribald jokes, pulp magazines, and anything else they felt within their remit. Pulp magazines like *Weird Tales*, which sometimes included nude women on the covers, faced internal conflict from readers for and against the practice; H. P. Lovecraft once famously opined:

> I have no objection to the nude in art—in fact, the human figure is as worthy a type of subject matter as any other object of beauty in the visible world. But I don’t see what the hell Mrs. Brundage’s undressed ladies have to do with weird fiction!

— H. P. Lovecraft to Willis Conover, *Selected Letters* 5.304

Lovecraft was also less than thrilled with the violence in his friend Robert E. Howard's stories of Conan the Cimmerian, noting:

> Robert E. Howard’s omnipresent gore-spattering is surely getting monotonous, but I fear it will prove a hard fault to eradicate. 

—H. P. Lovecraft to Clark Ashton Smith, 11 Sep 1931, *Dawnward Spire, Lonely Hill* 322

Lovecraft of course made no effort to eradicate either the nudes or the violence from *Weird Tales*; to editor Farnsworth Wright, both practices had their sales value and their audience. The pulps could safely advertise for mail-order works on birth control or the mysteries of sex, often under the thin disguise of works on anthropology and ethnography; the Society for the Suppression of Vice's unwillingness to go after academic texts provided a cover for publishers to produce ""dry"" treatises like *Voodoo-Eros: Ethnological Studies in the Sex-Life of the African Aborigines* (1933), and works on flagellation and physical punishment which the Society did not recognize as ""sexual"" proliferated; Robert E. Howard himself owned a copy of *Flagellation and the Flagellants: A History of the Rod in all Countries from the Earliest Period to the Present Time* (1910) and several other works—not necessarily because of prurient interest, but as raw material for his stories.

> The rhythm of the swaying bodies grew faster and into the space between the people and the monolith sprang a naked young woman, her eyes blazing, her long black hair flying loose. Spinning dizzily on her toes, she whirled across the open space and fell prostrate before the Stone, where she lay motionless. The next instant a fantastic figure followed her--a man from whose waist hung a goatskin, and whose features were entirely hidden by a sort of mask made from a huge wolf's head, so that he looked like a monstrous, nightmare being, horribly compounded of elements both human and bestial. In his hand he held a bunch of long fir switches bound together at the larger ends, and the moonlight glinted on a chain of heavy gold looped about his neck. A smaller chain depending from it suggested a pendant of some sort, but this was missing.
> 
> The people tossed their arms violently and seemed to redouble their shouts as this grotesque creature loped across the open space with many a fantastic leap and caper. Coming to the woman who lay before the monolith, he began to lash her with the switches he bore, and she leaped up and spun into the wild mazes of the most incredible dance I have ever seen. And her tormentor danced with her, keeping the wild rhythm, matching her every whirl and bound, while incessantly raining cruel blows on her naked body. And at every blow he shouted a single word, over and over, and all the people shouted it back. I could see the working of their lips, and now the faint far-off murmur of their voices merged and blended into one distant shout, repeated over and over with slobbering ecstasy. But what the one word was, I could not make out.

—Robert E. Howard, ""The Black Stone"", *Weird Tales* (Nov 1931)

Howard included such scenes in his stories, just as many other authors did, because including a nude woman increased the chances of getting a coveted cover illustration—which often brought a boost in pay as well as prestige. Making the nudity a scene of flagellation was a way to help get it past the censors, since the editor could point to the exact scene being illustrated, demonstrating it's ""literary"" value.

Other publications were not so discerning. As the pulp marketplace grew, it proliferated and diversified. Pulps were in constant competition to find new niches, and quickly specialized. Two in particular stand out in the late 1930s: the Spicy pulps, which focused on sex, and the Shudder pulps or weird terror pulps, which focused on grue.

Despite the name, the Spicy pulps sold the sizzle but not the steak; with their blatant focus on sex, they were obvious targets for censorship, and developed strict editorial guidelines about what to write and not write; illustrations and stories were routinely censored to be risque or sensual without crossing the line - often stipulating that a woman could not get entirely naked, or that a nude corpse was acceptable but not a living woman. Robert E. Howard wrote of writing for the spicies:

> A nice balance must be maintained — the stuff must be hot enough to make the readers bat their eyes, but not too hot to get the censors on them. They have some definite taboos. No degeneracy, for instance. No sadism or masochism. Though extremely fond of almost-nude ladies, they prefer her to retain some garment ordinarily — like a coyly revealing chemise. However this taboo isn’t iron-clad, for I’ve violated it in nearly every story I’ve sold them. I’ve found a good formula is to strip the heroine gradually — she loses part of her clothes in one episode, some more in the next, and so on until the climax finds her in a state of tantalizing innocence. Certain words are taboo, also, though up to a certain point considerable frankness in discussing the female anatomy is allowed.

—Robert E. Howard to Novalyne Price, 14 Feb 1936, *Collected Letters* 3.19

Shudder pulps represented the other end of the spectrum: sadism was the rule. These were the pulps that often featured bound women on the cover, sometimes being tortured in inventive ways, buried or burned or swallowed alive, and the contents reached a peak of grue that the more mainstream pulps wouldn't touch. The sadism angle sometimes saved them from censorship, but New York mayor Fiorrello LaGuardia was still moved to ban the sale of pulps with nude covers in the city in the 1930s.

Pulps were the direct precursors to comic books, often sharing the same writers, artists, editors, publishers, and distributors. The group behind the *Spicy* pulps ran comic strips in their magazines, and eventually became DC comics. Martin Goodman published horror pulps like *Uncanny Tales* and *Marvel Tales* before switching to Marvel Comics.

The early comics, like the pulps, were varied and self-policing. By the end of World War II, as paper restrictions were relaxed, there were crime comics and romance comics, science fiction comics and westerns, horror comics and sex comics - although the more explicit of the latter were still sold under the counter, often produced crudely by small groups rather than major syndicates like DC. Most companies had their own internal codes and guidelines; Sheldon Mayer at DC provided one list of rules for writers and artists in the 1940s:

1) Never show anybody stabbed or shot.

2) Show no torture scenes.

3) Never show a hypodermic needle.

4) Don't chop the limbs off anybody.

5) Never show a coffin, especially with the body in it.

—Mike Benton, *The Illustrated History of Horror Comics* 52

Not every publisher kept to such strict guidelines, and crime and horror comics in particular would often be particularly gruesome, reflecting the standards of the shudder pulps that they ultimately emerged from. Here, though, something different happened: somebody thought of the children."

670,AskHistorians,Have sleep patterns always been the same? I read recently that in the past few hundred years the eight hour overnight was not the norm and people would get up in the middle of the night and spend time together before returning to sleep. Is there truth to this?,"How's this for an answer: some likely did, but others likely didn't.

One caveat: I'm coming at this from a slightly different angle, which is familiarity with the history of sleep research rather than that of the eras you're asking about - so it's one reason I'm hopeful some of the medievalists and early modernists here chime in as I'm quite curious what (if any) debate there's been on this in their fields.

That said, the main contributor to noctural biphasic theory (versus biphasic in general, which can refer to daytime siestas as well) is a historian at Virginia Tech by the name of Roger Ekrich, who back in 2004 wrote a survey of nocturnal habits throughout the world, *At Day's Close - Night in Times Past*.  While much of the book dealt with various societal oddities throughout Europe at night, the one that caught the most traction was his analysis of literature that suggested that pre-industrial age humans slept somewhat differently than we do today:

>Until the close of the early modern era, Western Europeans on most evenings experienced two major intervals of sleep bridged by up to an hour or more of quiet wakefulness. In the absence of fuller descriptions, fragments in several languages in sources ranging from depositions and diaries to imaginative literature give clues to the essential features of this puzzling pattern of repose. The initial interval of slumber was usually referred to as “first sleep,” or, less often, “first nap” or “dead sleep.” In French, the term was premier sommeil or premier somme, in Italian, primo sonno or primo sono, and in Latin, primo somno or concubia nocte. The succeeding interval of sleep was called “second” or “morning” sleep, whereas the intervening period of wakefulness bore no name, other than the generic term “watch” or “watching.” Alternatively, two texts refer to the time of  of “first waking.”

>Both phases of sleep lasted roughly the same length of time, with individuals waking sometime after midnight before returning to rest. Not everyone, of course, slept according to the same timetable. The later at night that persons went to bed, the later they stirred after their initial sleep; or, if they retired past midnight, they might not awaken at all until dawn. Thus in “The Squire’s Tale” in The Canterbury Tales, Canacee slept “soon after evening fell” and subsequently awakened in the early morning following “her first sleep”; in turn, her companions, staying up much later, “lay asleep till it was fully prime” (daylight). William Baldwin’s satire Beware the Cat recounts a quarrel between the protagonist, “newly come unto bed,” and two roommates who “had already slept” their “first sleep.”

>Men and women referred to both intervals as if the prospect of awakening in the middle of the night was common knowledge that required no elaboration....

Ekrich goes on to review a reasonable amount of contemporary literature that suggested this was fairly commonplace and to note a series of early 1990 [experiments by Thomas Wehr at the NIH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10607034) that artificial light appeared to be one of the primary culprits responsible for disturbing biphasic sleep, along with a walk through what people actually used to do in the middle of the night.

So far, so good, and Ekrich continued this research across cultures and [published](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-history/faculty/a-roger-ekirch.html) in several fairly well respected journals, lectured in front of medical faculties, and even is on the board of the main publication of the National Sleep Foundation.

Except then in the early 2010s, his theory took a bit of a hit. Several anthropologists got interested in the subject, and realized that their field provided a fantastic opportunity to check on this with current day isolated preindustrial societies.  The result was a 2015 paper, [*Natural sleep and its seasonal variations in three societies*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4720388/), that went a step further and put Actiwatches on current day pre-industrial societies near the equator - and noted precisely none of them experienced biphasic sleep.

[Ekrich's response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4763365/#B4) is quite interesting, and in a sign of the importance his theories had gained it appeared in what's considered the main sleep research journal, *Sleep*.  But the relevant part for your question is this portion:

>As I have recently written at length, consolidated sleep to which the industrialized world aspires, if not always successfully—due perhaps to the persistence of this once dominant pattern—is for Western societies a remarkably youthful form of sleep, a product not of the primeval past but of forces grounded in technology (artificial illumination) and shifting cultural attitudes toward sleep over the course of the Industrial Revolution. ***This is not to argue that segmented sleep has been the predominant pattern of sleep among all preindustrial peoples in the non-Western world.*** [emphasis added]

So, the best answer is probably that it depends on the population and possibly where they're located, along with how much artificial light they were exposed to.

Edit: And thanks for the gold, kind stranger!"
671,AskHistorians,"How true is the claim, that the Catholic Church introduced celibacy to prevent priest's children from inheriting the Church's property?","The medieval Church was in the business of saving souls. This is the key point to remember when looking at motivations that we might today classify as ""sacred"" versus ""profane"". The distinction would have seemed beside the point to eleventh- and twelfth-century reformers who believed that a powerful, independent, and wealthy Church was an *effective* Church. So scholars more typically classify the evident motivations for the ideology of clerical celibacy as *ritual* and *practical*. 

On one hand, sex was dirty and women were dirtier. For priests who stood in for Christ in celebrating the Eucharist (Communion, the major sacrament of the Church), it was necessary to be freed of ""the reek and screams of
snivelling brats, side by side with a smirking, randy wife...[and] daily temptations to unclean thoughts, words, and deeds"" (James Brundage, of [Medieval Penitential Sex Flowchart](http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/flowchart.png) fame, paraphrasing theologian Peter Damian). Sex and marriage (implying sex), argued the reformers, threatened priests' ability to perform their duties most properly.

On the other hand, leading reformers had practical, economic/social concerns over clerics as heads of families. First, families were more expensive to keep up than one man or one man and a servant. First, reformers argued that donations/tithes to a church or cathedral chapter would go towards supporting a wife and children instead of being funneled back into the parish or cathedral church.

Second, and more importantly, reformers had good reason to fear that clerics with families were loyal to their families, bound up in worldly socio-political networks and relationships so that they thought of their families first rather than the good of the Church. The most (in)famous form of this, of course, was clerical sons inheriting Church positions from their fathers. It was standard in the Middle Ages for sons to follow their fathers into a profession; we have ample evidence that this was no different for clerics' sons (including after clerical marriage was abolished so all children were illegitimate! they just needed special dispensation from the bishop, which was basically always granted). 

Why this was a particular problem was that many, though definitely not all, Church positions were amply or even lavishly funded benefices. (Many clergy, especially village priests, actually worked separate jobs such as blacksmithing in order to survive). Allowing clerics to have families of their own kept them, through marriage and through social status as virile/reproductive *men*, tied into aristocratic or even small-scale social networks and thus sharing the concerns of their extended family. That is, the good of the *family* and individual relatives rather than of the Church.

We know that the ability to link into extended family webs was a major temptation for high medieval clergy. One preferred strategy was to acquire, in addition to, say, a role as a chantry priest or parish priest, *multiple* positions as a canon at a cathedral--positions that did not require active pastoral ministry, but came with a nice income. This allowed priests to pass on an inheritance to multiple sons. 

As for daughters, both potential marriage matches *and* offspring were concerns for Church authority. Nicholas Crocemannus in 12th century England passed on two of the prebends he had acquired at St. Paul's to his grandsons! And reformers had long viewed it as advantageous for the *Church* to have a say in aristocratic partnerships. The strict but Church-waivable rules on consanguinity (i.e. incest) might be selectively applied in order to increase the chances that future generations of a family would find it more advantageous to leave a ""leased"" tract of land in monastic or episcopal control rather than reclaiming its rents and products. (There seems to have been a belief that too-powerful lords would repossess lots of land, whereas if tracts of land could be kept relatively small, the Church would be more likely to maintain control.)

One of the most important things to remember about the campaign for clerical celibacy, however, is that it spent the Middle Ages basically not working. Ruth Mazo Karras and others have studied court cases involving clerical concubinage/fornication in the late Middle Ages, and basically concluded that it didn't matter as a general rule; specifics of a given case--popular anger at a particular cleric for some perceived breach of duty--were necessary to trigger an investigation and prosecution. Jennifer Thibodeaux has shown how, in the centuries following the eleventh-century reforms, clerical sons adapted to the new rules and still managed to (a) become priests (b) sometimes wealthy ones.

672,AskHistorians,"Odysseus has sex with several women (Hecuba, Circe, Calypso) but Penelope remains loyal to his husband. Odysseus' infidelity is not chastised in the story, so how commonplace was this ideology of sex in ancient Greece? Were men expected to be monogamous?","The *Odyssey* absolutely and explicitly sets up a double standard, but it's not the one OP's question claims.

In book 5, we're introduced to Our Mighty Hero...sitting on a rock on an island beach, staring at the sea and sobbing. He is somewhere been stranded and an actual prisoner on the island belonging to the ""lovely goddess"" Calypso. The poem implies that there was some mutual attraction between them initially. But in the *years* he's been on the island, that has evaporated. They sleep together every night, sure, but Odysseus isn't happy about it. It is possible, although not definitive, to read the situation as coercion/rape.

But this isn't the concern of the poem itself, which doesn't frame this as a ""normal"" relationship between men and women. Why not? Because Calypso isn't a woman, she's a *goddess*. When Hermes comes along to pass on the order for her to help Odysseus leave the island, *that* is the framework with which she protests. From the Penguin Classics translation:

> You are hard-hearted, you gods, and unmatched for jealousy. You are outraged if a goddess sleeps openly with a man even if she has chosen him as her husband. You were the same when rosy-fingered Dawn fell in love with Orion. Free and easy yourselves, you were outraged at her conduct, and in the end chaste Artemis of the golden throne rose, attacked him in Ortygie with her gentle arrows and left him dead. And so again, when the lovely Demeter gave way to her desire and made love with her beloved lasion in the field of the three ploughed furrows, Zeus heard of it quickly enough and struck him dead with his blinding thunderbolt.

The contrast with, of course, [Zeus](https://imgur.com/a/ODdV1i9) is clear. Calypso gets to essentially denounce all of Greek mythology as sexist, even if it is not a sparklingly feminist message today.

""Adultery"" in the traditional sense, thus, is not the issue in this case.

That said, K.J. Dover and other scholars are exquisitely clear that under Athenian law (to be fair, not necessarily the situation reflected by tradition of singing the *Odyssey*), adultery with citizen women was very not okay for men. Naturally, it was a crime committed not against morality or the polity, but against a specific man who had legal control of the woman involved:

> But Greek laws were not lenient towards adultery, and *moikbeia*, for
whch we have no suitable translation except ""adultery,"" denoted not
only the seduction of another man’s wife, but also the seduction of h s
widowed mother, unmarried daughter, sister, niece, or any other woman
whose legal guardan he was.

Dover adds that adultery was considered *worse* than rape, because rape was considered a crime of passion and the moment whereas to carry on an affair involved *seduction*--that is, a long period of time and effort. Xenophon's *Hiero*, which is more or less a work of political philosophy, compares the two:

> At any rate, it is not uncommon for the laws of
communities to allow people to kill seducers, and only seducers, with impunity, and
the thinking behind this law is obviously that seduction impairs the affection a wife
feels for her husband. After all, if sex takes place without the woman’s consent, this
does not make the slightest difference to the regard her husband feels for her, as long
as the affection she feels for him remains inviolate.

Now, it's important to keep in mind that we're dealing primarily with normative or prescriptive sources here, not descriptive. (And Xenophon, for his part, is exaggerating a bit for rhetorical effect, as Edward Harris points out--seduction/adultery was by no means the only crime for which one could be executed.) The cuckolded man was afforded, in theory, a significant amount of say over how/whether the philandering man was punished. So even under the law, there would be a lot of room for flexibility or ambiguity in what actually happened.

However, more literary/normative sources are particularly useful in reflecting one aspect of the situation: being seen as an adulterer was *not* good. The *fama* for such men would swirl with scorn and satire. Dover suggests that because women were seen as easily seduced and swayed by temptation meant that adulterers rather than the cheated-upon received the brunt of social derision.

But just as we have to consider the context of Odysseus sleeping with (under ambiguous terms of consent) a *goddess*, the status of women in relationships outside marriage also mattered. For example, enslaved women were subject to rape by their owners and by whomever their owners gave them to as a ""gift."""
673,AskHistorians,"How do we know that ancient Greeks/Scandinavians/Egyptians/etc. believed in their gods, and that it wasn't just a collection of universally known fictional characters a la the Looney Tunes, with poems and theme parks dedicated to them?","How do we know what people in the ancient world believed?

We read their literature, as well as we know how, and so far as it still exists. We excavate their cities and sanctuaries, and interpret them as carefully as we can. And then we try to shore the literary fragments against the ruins, and extrapolate a world. Can we know what individuals thought? Unless they were kind enough to write it down for us (and their jottings survived), no. But to the extent that the literature and the archaeological remains seem to agree, and to the extent that our cross-cultural models allow us to understand them, we can usually form a picture, however hazy, of practice and belief in an ancient society. 

As devoted readers of this sub, you know all this already. I just felt like pontificating. For a little more substance, let's turn, all too briefly, to the Greeks and Romans. 

Two blanket statements. First, virtually all Greeks and Romans believed in their gods. Second, belief in the gods did not necessarily translate to a literal understanding of the traditional myths about those gods. 

Greek religion and Roman religion - to use conventional shorthands for what were actually loose families of affiliated but distinctive local practices - were focused on practice, rather than belief. The gods, in other words, were assumed to be much more interested in what their worshipers did for them than in what their worshipers thought them. This meant, in effect, that the act of sacrifice was the ultimate statement of belief: gratifying the gods with burnt offerings (or libations, etc.) was at once a prudent insurance policy and an effective profession of faith. It might be tempting to imagine (by analogy with modern religious holidays) that traditional religious festivals in the classical world eventually became more or less formalities - a chance for everybody to kick back, watch a little drama, and enjoy a bit of barbecued ox. For some Greeks and Romans, they may well have become so. But the mere fact that sacrifices continued regularly, century after century, in so many ancient cities suggests that the great majority took them quite seriously: the gods were real, and had to be placated. To this can be added the vast body of evidence for personal devotion to the gods - family altars, ex voto offerings, dedications at shrines, etc., etc. And to that we may add the testimonials provided by our  literary sources, which establish beyond a shadow of a doubt that the great majority of Greeks and Romans assumed that the gods were very real. 

None of this means, of course, that they took the myths seriously. As early as the sixth century BC, Greek philosophers and public intellectuals began to criticize the myths. Some of the more radical thinkers of the Classical period theorized that the myths were actually dimly-remembered episodes from ancient history, and that the gods had originally been human kings and inventors. Others speculated that the gods and the myths had been deliberately invented in the distant past as a means of political control. Similar strands of criticism are visible in Stoic philosophy (which treated the myths as allegories), in Epicurean philosophy (which treated the myths as dangerous fables), and in the general intellectual milieu of the Roman imperial era (see, for example, the splendid satires of Lucian). It seems clear that most educated Greeks and Romans really did regard the myths as a matter of cultural literacy, not literal truth. But their disdain for the myths was motivated largely by a desire to disassociate them from the gods, in whom most of them still believed. The myths, it was thought, were unworthy of the gods, and the gods undeserving of the myths foisted upon them by tradition. 

I could cite various passages from ancient authors in support of all this; but frankly, I'm tired. The point, in any case, needs no belaboring. In certain contexts, many Greeks and Romans were perfectly comfortable mocking the gods of myth - take Dionysus in Aristophanes' Frogs, or Zeus in any of Lucian's dialogues. There were even ""theme parks"" of a sort, in the case of Ilium, a major tourist destination on what was thought to be the site of Homer's Troy ([more on such tourism here](https://toldinstone.com/where-did-the-greeks-and-romans-go-on-vacation/)). But for most Greeks and Romans (with the exception of those wretched atheistic Epicureans), the gods were real. Take the emperor Julian's heartfelt (if tedious) hymn to Cybele, or Apuleius' paean to Isis, or Aelius Aristides' praises of Ascelpius, or even - at the beginning of classical literature - Odysseus' relationship with Athena. The Greeks and Romans didn't always take their gods seriously. But they never - quite - reduced them to cartoon characters."
674,AskHistorians,What lead to the transition from the flamboyant pastel colours of automobiles in the '50s and '60s to the drab and tame colours of today?,"I think its important to note, alongside the technological, economic, and psychological considerations, that colors have their own cycles of popularity. During the 1950s and early 1960s, both interior design and fashion saw an explosion of bright colors:

[1956 ""Spangles"" candy advertisement](https://fineartamerica.com/featured/spangles-1956-1950s-uk-sweets-party-the-advertising-archives.html?product=poster)

Far from the idealized, nostalgic image of the period as being full of pastels and pink and turquoise (man, I wrote a good answer about this I'd love to link, but I can't seem to find it), there was a lot of bright red, lemon yellow, forest green, etc. Living rooms and kitchens were full of bold colors, often placed right next to each other in a way that we would find clashy and horrible today.

Lots of things changed in the 1960s, and popular colors were part of it. While people did continue to wear bright colors, earth tones began to be more important - both because of the rising counterculture and the rising interest in Colonial Revival: mustard, brownish orange, dark brown and wood grain, avocado. And what do you see in cars of the late 1960s and 1970s, though not exclusively?

[Muted colors, especially shades of brown and orange.](http://www.oldcaradvertising.com/AMC%20Ads/1974%20AMC%20Other/1974%20AMC%20Ad-02.html)

In the 1980s, people certainly continued to wear and use bright colors, but whites, off-whites, and greys became very common parts of the interior design palette, as well as glass and chrome - a space-age rebound from the historical/natural trend of the previous period. It's unsurprising that car colors would become similarly utilitarian."
675,AskHistorians,"In Greek mythology, the gods are said to live atop Mount Olympus. Olympus is an actual real mountain in Greece. Did the Ancient Greeks never climb the mountain? Wouldn't it have been obvious that no actual gods lived there?","As the excellent comment by /u/Daeres notes, there were always unresolved tensions in the Greek conception of Olympos. Even in the Iliad, the earliest extant work of Greek literature, Olympos is described both as a physical mountain (with epithets like ""snowy"" and ""craggy"") and as a metonym for the heavens. At times, Homer's Olympus is clearly conceived as something more than a physical mountain, as when Zeus tells the other gods:

""If you tied a chain of gold to the sky, and all of you, gods and goddesses, took hold, you could not drag Zeus the High Counselor to earth with all your efforts. But if I determined to pull with a will, I could haul up land and sea, then loop the chain round a peak of Olympus, and leave them dangling in space. By that much am I greater than gods and men."" (*Iliad* 8.19-26)

This dual conception of Olympus as both physical peak and heavenly realm continues throughout Greek (and later Latin) literature. The discrepancies between these conceptions are clear in the mythological compendium known as Apollodorus' *Bibliotheca* (probably written in the second century CE). In a myth about twin giants who attempted to storm the homes of the gods, the author notes:

""When they were nine years old and measured eighteen feet across by fifty four feet tall, they decided to fight the gods. So they set Mount Ossa on top of Mount Olympus, and then placed Mount Pelion on top of Ossa, threatening by means of these mountains to climb up to the sky"" (1.53)

Here, at least, there is a clear distinction between Olympus and the home of the gods. The distinction in even clearer in Lucian's *Icaromennipus,* a rather strange second-century text about a man who decides to fly to the home of the gods. Mennipus (the protagonist) doesn't bother with Olympus; he sets sail directly into the sky, and figures that the gods leave very far off indeed. To quote his calculations:

""Let me see, now. First stage, Earth to Moon, 350 miles. Second stage, up to the Sun, 500 leagues. Then the third, to the actual Heaven and Zeus's citadel, might be put at a day's journey for an eagle in light marching order.""

So it was widely assumed, at least by educated men of the imperial era, that the gods were not confined to Olympus. So did they climb the physical mountain? They certainly got close. Although the Greeks and Romans were not usually recreational mountain climbers, a few were in the habit - the emperor Hadrian, for example, once climbed to the peak of Mt. Etna to watch the sunrise (SHA, *Hadrian* 13). And in the case of Olympus, there was actually a sanctuary of Zeus quite close to the top. From the third century BCE to the fifth century CE, offerings were made at an altar on Hagios Antonios, a peak about a mile from the main summit. 

We don't know whether anyone made the climb from the altar to the main peak, though it certainly would have been possible to do so. And we don't know whether the experience of climbing so close to the traditional home of the gods affected anyone's conception of Olympus. At least some, however, seem to have considered the lack of winds around Zeus' altar a sign that it was a sacred place:

""The things that are to be seen at Olympus show that Homer did not celebrate it rashly. First, it rises so high, with a preeminent peak, that the inhabitants call the top of it heaven. On the summit is an altar dedicated to Zeus. If burned offerings of entrails are brought to it, they are neither blown off by windy breath nor washed away by rain, but as the year rolls on, whatever is left there is discovered unchanged; what is consecrated to the god triumphs over time and the corruption of the air. Letters written in the ashes remain until the next year’s ceremony."" (Solinus 8.6)"
676,AskHistorians,Big boys don't cry: when became strong emotions in men unmanly?,"I had thought that we had previous answers on this topic, but when I looked, they were all bounded to specific periods rather than exploring the change, so you get a fresh new one.

Contrary to the assertions in many of the now-removed comments, masculinity and tears have not always been at odds. I am not prepared to discuss when this began, but in the Middle Ages there was a trope of masculine weeping being a mark of religious devotion and knightly chivalry; by the sixteenth century it was well-established that a masculine man was supposed to have deep emotions and to show them - in some cases, through tears. Masculinity is *not* inherently constructed as relating primarily to brute strength and stoicism, although it's common for people to think that it is out of presentism (inserting modern values into the past), as well as a view that the past was when ""men were men"" and the modern version of masculinity is therefore a watered-down version of a previous version. 

The early modern British conceptualization of masculinity rested instead upon a range of virtues, from the more obvious strength, bravery, and honorable reputation to honesty, prudence, and self-sufficiency, with interpretations of which were more important differing based on how much patriarchal power and what kind of it different groups of men had. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the virtues of politeness and self-restraint came to the fore. A gentleman was to be courteous to women and other men, to talk problems out, to keep from bursting into loud displays of anger or drunkenness. You might think that that would also put the kibosh on weeping - giving way to feelings of all sorts - but this was not the case. Another gentlemanly trait of the eighteenth century was sensibility, which today sounds like it ought to mean ""rationality"", but is actually being aware of and susceptible to one's finer emotions. This was frequently represented in sentimental novels of the period in ways similar to those you've noted in your question: they weep out of sadness and pity, and sometimes faint when the emotion they feel becomes too much. (That being said, women were generally conceded to have a greater amount of natural sensibility than men on average.) Down the social scale into the middle classes, standards of politeness were more informal and concerns more restricted to physically-restrained conduct, and we have very little idea of what constituted 'masculinity"" in a working-class context.

Tears started to become more strongly feminized in the nineteenth century, and it appears to happen first with boys at school. Through the middle of the century, it was still acceptable for men to weep in their own grief, gratitude, or pity, or, for instance, while watching an emotional scene in a play or melodrama - Dickens once noted that he ""invariably [began] to cry whenever anybody on the stage forgives an enemy or gives away a pocket-book"". It was even laudable, to middle- and upper-class observers, when working-class men showed their humanity by crying at appropriate times. At the same time, an incident of schoolyard bullying in *David Copperfield* involves one student standing up for another and weeping to some extent as he does so, which results in a caning from a teacher and feminizing mockery from the bully: the student is definitely portrayed as being in the right, and we know that Dickens was a supporter of male tears, but in the context of a Victorian boys' boarding school showing emotion was simply not done. Other narratives of boarding and day schools bear out the same principle of self-restraint in the face of sensibility, with not ""blubbing"" in the face of beating being a point of pride and the people one missed from home being never mentioned except to your closest friends in private, and parenting manuals began to preach that children cried to manipulate and must learn to control themselves and their emotions.

The concept of the ""stiff upper lip"" - originally an Americanism! - started to become a key part of British identity in the 1870s and 1880s, as the children who'd faced this scholastic experience replaced the previous generation of adults and the so-called ""cult of sensibility"" completely died away, to be replaced with stoic self-restraint. Even outside of Britain, obvious tears from men and boys were seen as embarrassing. Men were to be utterly ""rational"" instead of emotional, or, more modernly put, were to value reals over feels. To not do this was to be unmasculine and womanly - and while male effeminacy had been a concern for a long time, this is the period that saw real ""scientific"" attention paid to issues of gender and sexuality, as well as more public discourse on the same, which could lead to serious consequences for the unmasculine man.

677,AskHistorians,How did butlers and staff keep candle chandeliers clean before chandeliers were wired with electricity? It seems the wax would just get everywhere and being a complete pain to maintain. Was the wax ever reused?,"Modern media has a tendency to portray pre-electrified rooms in a fashion much brighter than a contemporary person living at that time would have experienced while moving about in them. Indeed, by modern standards, the average dining room or ballroom of the 18th century would have been vastly underlit, especially if one applied the illumination of that period to the relatively spartan décor of today. The designers therefore employed a sleight of hand when creating their rooms: almost every surface was reflective in order to amplify the light.

The first recognisable chandeliers appeared sometime during the early reign of Louis XIV and were, themselves, an evolution of the [candelabra](https://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2019/excellence-pf1911/lot.92.html), a type of portable candlestick that contained several arms (typically six) versus a standard [chamberstick](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2019/style-silver-ceramics-furniture/cbd2eb43-1ee0-4cb9-bc3e-f28f42458813) consisting of a single light that would have been used by an individual in a private setting, such as reading, going to the bathroom or other nocturnal activities that require a source of light. They were also technologically different from earlier large hanging light fixtures by virtue of the intensity of light they gave off, thereby making a cohesive plan for lighting a room possible. These [early chandeliers]( https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/a-louis-xiv-ormolu-six-light-chandelier-attributed-5639216-details.aspx) were invariably made of parcel gilt wood and ormolu or, in the case of the Sun King himself, out of sterling or gilt silver in order to better amplify illumination in the room. This light would have then bounced off several other reflective surfaces such as sterling silver [flatware](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/200240) and [hollowware](https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/soupiere-et-son-couvercle-en-argent-par-6196916-details.aspx?from=salesummery&intObjectID=6196916) -- itself an improvement upon the earlier and [less reflective pewter](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_1900-0212-1) of a generation prior -- [brass fixtures](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/206990), [gilt ornament](https://www.kunsthandel-muehlbauer.com/en/object-detail.html?id=129) and any other object that could scatter the light. What modern eyes therefore view as a riot of rococo excess, an explosion of gold and silver detailing on walls, would have been far more muted when experienced in person under candlelight. In some cases, guests arriving at night could not be expected to make out paintings at all.

Jules Hardouin Mansart, the court architect to Louis XIV, ran into this precise problem when he was charged with displaying a set of massive tributary and allegorical paintings of Louis XIV in the Grande Galerie of the Palace of Versailles. These paintings, created by the Sun King’s favourite painter Charles Le Brun, could not be seen by arriving guests and Mansart was charged with undertaking this technical challenge. The issue of light soon began to plague Mansart as he struggled with the challenge of illuminating the ceiling of a cavernous room: after lowering the ceiling *twice* (it is about two yards shorter than the actual roofline) and blowing out the windows to three times their original size in order to let in sunshine and starlight, the paintings could still not be seen in detail by observers below. Mansart’s final innovation, an extraordinarily costly wall of mirrored windows set perpendicularly to a concave roof vault, did the trick and made the Grande Galerie into one of the most famous rooms of all time. When Louis XIV first launched his fete to inaugurate the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, he spent nearly 117,000 livres on the party – a third of the annual cost of running the vast chateau – and spectators were awed by how *bright* the room was, an effect compounded by the king’s use of fireworks outside. Indeed, the room is quite literally more vivid at night when fully illuminated by candles than it is during the day when its details are lit by modern LED lighting, as can be seen from [this picture](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Vz-htNRWpbeI-UU7og2BGacHwVoeN09XrsoRX0ucvFstfJ5Fv6xp8rtXEr2D82C7XoUlgXPdc8TuCgr4wQn965PE8JeyLExPctwIi17YHJsI8g) from the Hall of Mirrors' 2007 renovation. (While the thought of any sort of active fire in the Hall of Mirrors would undoubtedly make a docent scream, the modern lights are made of historically accurate wax and designed to approximate the effect of being lit by candle.) In short, not only was light expensive, it could also be dazzling in every sense of the word, a demonstration of the host’s taste, power and refinement. Candles were, relatively speaking, cheap. But the other accoutrements required to really make a room shine were not.

By the mid-19th century, chandeliers were composed of two forms: the solid metal chandelier and the lead crystal chandelier. The latter was naturally brighter by virtue of its thousands of delicate pieces, called pendants, made from lead crystal and then faceted in order to increase the scattering of light in the room. The fashion for these lead crystal sconces and chandeliers reached their height in the late Victorian era – the cultural trope of the French chambermaid and her featherduster comes from the Victorian propensity for dusting everything – but the cleaning process for both is relatively straightforward. Household staff would clear the room of furniture and lower the chandelier via an internal pulley system in the wall onto a drop cloth lain down on the floor of the room for disassembly. The individual pieces would be marked, boiled in batches in order to remove any errant wax and washed in soap and water. They were then put together using cotton gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints.

In most cases, the wax was less of a problem than you’d think as long as the candle stood upright in its nozzle. In this case, a little bit of wax was actually welcome. Footmen or maids would insert a small piece of sticky material, typically beeswax comb, onto the bottom of nozzles in order to allow the candle to stand perfectly upright. During the course of an evening, the candle wax would empty out into the drip tray, which would have to be removed and boiled every few days in order to accommodate wax buildup. In some brass chandeliers, especially those used in commercial or industrial settings, the drip tray could be quite large in order to accommodate a bigger candle and to clean them less often.

Servants would often replace a candle before it became a sticky mess for this reason. They obviously could not do it during an event, but illuminatory candles generally had some staying power. British East India Company employees experiencing culture shock are a good source of material about burning times. In Europe, the best wax candles burnt for somewhere in between four to five hours. The average Indian candle could burn for upwards of ten and were allegedly imported to Britain in enormous quantities prior to shifting some production back to the metropole. At any rate, the candles and wax never went to waste.

Senior household staff were generally expected to have their pick of remaining (but used) candles for their own personal use. Leftover wax in drip trays, especially if the candles were made of beeswax, were popular items for polishing furniture and floors. Wax, especially the paraffin wax candle patented by James Young in 1856, could be resold due to the petroleum-based nature of these products, but more often than not wax that couldn’t be used domestically was simply dumped along with other refuse in the cesspools. In Georgian London, these were cleared of their “night soil” every four to eight months by workers. This is where most of the remaining wax ended up.

678,AskHistorians,"We hear a lot about the Aztecs, but the Purepecha Empire next door was almost their equal in size and kept the Aztecs at bay militarily. Was the Purepecha Empire a state of similar standing? Why don't we hear more about it?","The P'urépecha state, *Irechecua Tzintzuntzani* (literally ""The Kingdom of Tzintzuntzan"") was the third largest state in the Americas at the time of Spanish conquest, behind the Inca and Aztec empires. They occupied a territory of 75,000 square kilometers (about the size of Scotland) at the time of Spanish arrival, and were larger than that in their past. They were perhaps the most centralized state in Mesoamerica, had a sophisticated network of border fortifications, and are one of the few pre-Columbian states to not just successfully resist an Aztec Invasion, but soundly defeat them. So I would say, yes, they were in a ""state of similar standing"" to the Aztecs.

The reason we don't hear more about it is that it hasn't been studied as much. In contrast to the Aztecs, our historical sources on the P'urépecha are much thinner. The main historical source, the *Relacion de Michoacán*, is pretty much all there is on the pre-Columbian history. There are few minor sources, like the *Lienzo de Jicalán* or *La Memoria de Don Melchor Caltzin*, but these discuss specific, isolated events. They don't provide the overview narrative history that we need to flesh in lots of the details. While there are a few colonial era sources, like the *Relaciones Geograficas*, there isn't really anything comparable to the numerous Spanish chroniclers and native historians that we have for the Aztecs. This is largely due to the fact that the Aztecs provided a stiff resistance to the Spanish, and their state became the backbone of the Spanish colonial administration after the conquest. The P'urépecha, by contrast, surrendered without fighting because they were dealing with the smallpox outbreak and a coup when the Spanish entered the territory. Rather than forming the basis for a colonial administration, their political institutions were largely cut out of the colonial system in the 17th century when the Spanish decided to make their own regional capital (modern day Morelia) to bypass native authority.

On the archaeology side, the region has been heavily understudied as well. Early work started with Alfonso Caso and some of his disciples doing some cursory excavations at the civic-ceremonial core of the capital, Tzintzuntzan, in the early 20th century. The region was largely ignored from that point until the late 1970s when Hellen Pollard did her PhD dissertation on the urban layout of the capital. Pollard did some further work on some of the smaller cities on the west side of the lake basin in the 1980s, and at the same time her colleague Shirley Gorenstein did some archaeological work on the northeastern frontier. There were a few other historians and archaeologists during this period, but prior to the start of the 21st century I can literally count on my hands the number of people who seriously studied the region in an academic capacity. One can contrast this to the Maya region where you can't throw a rock without hitting another archaeologist.

As to why the region is understudied, there's a kind of feedback loop in the research of Native American cultures. People look at the (lack of) existing research, conclude that the region is not interesting or doesn't have anything worth pursuing, and therefore they don't study it. It's much easier to get grant money studying a culture like the Aztecs, or the Maya, where you *know* you'll find something. Since nobody researches it, nobody finds anything, and so nobody looks. Up until very recently, the general conclusion was that despite the size of the empire the area was a cultural backwater that only recently acquired urban civilization. In fact, if you pick up any book or article written before about 2010 it would tell you that there were no cities in Michoacán prior to the formation of the P'urépecha state, and that the P'urépecha lacked even a pictographic script like the Aztecs. (We now know neither of these assumptions were true.)

Luckily, this situation is now changing as there is a renewed interest in the region. There's been a lot of recent research on the culture, but unfortunately little of this research has been published in English. A French team organized through Centre d'Études Mexicaines et Centroaméricaines (CEMCA) conducted a decades long project studying the Zacapu Basin (the lake basin immediately north of Lake Pátzcuaro where the empire formed). This project has published extensively in both French and Spanish, but almost none of their work is available in English. An American team organized principally through Colorado State University has for several years been studying an extremely large city on the east side of the Lake Basin that was not previously known to archaeologists. The results of this research are likely to completely rewrite our history of P'urépecha state formation, but unfortunately little of that research has been published as of yet, outside of PhD dissertations and a few cursory overview articles. There's also a Mexican team organized through UNAM who is actively working on a site south of the Lake Pátzcuaro basin which is just now getting started.

The issue is that so much of this research is so new that it will take time for the academic arguments to shake out into a new consensus. I imagine that, in a few years (or decades), we will probably have enough information for somebody to write a new synthesis.

I will add sources and other info to this post later if people are interested. There are a few English language articles available that can provide a sense of the current scholarship. But right now it's really late where I am so I'm going to bed and I'll add more info tomorrow.

EDIT:

Okay, I'm awake and I've had my coffee. First, I want to direct people to the [relevant section](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books/americas/latinamerica#wiki_tarascan) of the AskHistorians book list. The two books on there are the standard introductory works, but both are out of date by this point. I'd still recommend them for people coming fresh to the topic with no background knowledge, as there isn't really anything comparable that incorporates new research.

Another recent book that is a fantastic read is [Afandor-Pujol's book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Relación_de_Michoacán_1539_1541_an/Q8BjCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1) analyzing the main historical source. This book is about the early colonial period more than the pre-Columbian state, but it provides the best breakdown of how to view the primary source material I've seen. It is this book which argues (rather conclusively) that the P'urépecha did indeed have pictographic writing like the Aztecs.

There have been two recent PhD dissertations that provide the most comprehensive overview so far of the American lead research at the (probably misnamed) site of Angamuco on the east side of the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin. The first, by [Anna Cohen](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/37012), looks at the site's ceramic chronology. The second, by [Rodrigo Solinis-Casparius](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/44938), looks at the site's road network. You can download both as pdfs through the link provided (the pdf link itself is on the left hand side of the page). Being dissertations, these book-length documents are very data heavy. If you decide to read them, you may want to skip over most of the body chapters and focus on the intro and conclusion chapters, unless you have a burning curiosity for the nuts and bolts of archaeological research.

Other articles on this research are unfortunately locked behind paywaylls. If you have access to an academic library, there's a [chapter in a book](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-6074-9_16) written by the project's director which provides an overview of the site. There has also been a recent publication on architecture at the site, also behind a paywall [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/latin-american-antiquity/article/typology-of-ancient-purepecha-tarascan-architecture-from-angamuco-michoacan-mexico/AD00553339FA5628A4FA1A344EDF5B36).

A few of you also asked for Spanish language sources. The French project working in the Zacapu basin has published a great overview in Spanish available [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/latin-american-antiquity/article/typology-of-ancient-purepecha-tarascan-architecture-from-angamuco-michoacan-mexico/AD00553339FA5628A4FA1A344EDF5B36). Another overview of the project offering a different perspective was written by Charlotte Arnauld (2015 - ""Evolución de la ocupación humana en el centro-norte de Michoacán"" in *Génesis, culturas, y espacios*). I can't find a copy of it online, unfortunately. The entire full text of the *Relacion de Michoacán* is also available on the [Colegio de Michoacán's website](http://etzakutarakua.colmich.edu.mx/proyectos/relaciondemichoacan/) along with other helpful information on things like geography.

The most active Mexican archaeologist studying the P'urépecha is Jose Luis Punzo Diaz. Most of his research up until now has been looking at the Epiclassic Period (600-900 AD) site of Tingambato, which predates the formation of the state by many centuries. His articles on this, which you can find by [searching his name on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C6&q=jose+luis+punzo+diaz) are largely on really specialized topics. Results of dating techniques, geophysical prospection, ceramic analysis, etc. There isn't much in the way of synthesis articles. He has recently started a new project south of the Lake Pátzcuaro basin looking at a site closer to the period of the P'urépecha state, but to my knowledge there haven't been any big publications on that yet. He just started a few years ago.

If anyone has any specific questions about any of this research, or anything else on the P'urépecha, I will be happy to answer them."
679,AskHistorians,"The People's Republic of China technically has 8 minor, legally-sanctioned political parties besides the Communist Party of China. What's the history of these parties? What purpose did they serve in a de facto one-party state?","This post has generated significant interest and been up for 13 hours without an answer. I am not a professional historian, but my work involves researching China and some parts of its modern history. I’d like to try to give people clarity on this issue as best I can with a few of the sources I have on hand. Let the mods decide if it’s acceptable to leave up.

Apologies in advance for typos. I’m on mobile. Sources listed at the bottom of the post.

The 8 non-Communist political parties in China are collectively called the “democratic parties.” They have a total membership of about 700,000 members, mostly professionals, intellectuals, scientists, artisans, and entrepreneurs.(1) Membership allegedly requires sponsorship by senior members of the party a person wishes to join.(2) These parties do not vie for power over the state, but express the concerns and ideas of their members as they relate to policy, regulation, and governance to the incumbent state power—namely, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).(1)

The principal mechanism through which these parties exercise their voice is the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Congress (CPPCC). The easiest way to understand the CPPCC is as a forum for the CCP to hear feedback on the effects of their policies and collect ideas on what reforms might be beneficial to certain constituents. All 8 democratic parties are represented in the CPPCC, but their voices compete with 25 other non-CCP constituencies represented in the CPPCC. The CPPCC is charter-bound to accept the CCP’s leadership.(1)

Still, their views can affect things in small ways or on specific policy points. For example, a CPPCC member once complained about travel restrictions on scholars, arguing that the restrictions hampered other CCP efforts to make Chinese ideas “go global.” The restrictions were modified based on this criticism.(3) I’ll note there are probably more substantive examples, especially on issues like environmental challenges, but I’m not aware of any specific instances.

Simply put, you can think of the democratic parties as lobbying groups that represent some segments of Chinese society. That is how they function. Their members meet at semi-regular intervals to discuss issues, conduct research, and submit proposals to be taken to the CCP for consideration (again, mostly through the CPPCC).(2) They also allegedly influence policy at the local levels through those governing bodies and are sometimes sought out for comment by CCP officials during the policy-making process.(2)

The existence of the democratic parties has its roots in the CCP’s revolutionary history, political necessity, and the CCP’s concept of “democracy.” The preamble of China’s constitution is pretty clear on the first two the first two points: “In the long years of revolution and construction, there has been formed under the leadership of the Communist Party of China a broad patriotic united front that is composed of democratic parties and people's organizations.... The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is a broadly representative organization of the united front, which has played a significant historical role and will continue to do so in the political and social life of the country, in promoting friendship with the people of other countries and in the struggle for socialist modernization and for the reunification and unity of the country.”(4) In the simplest terms, at a time when the CCP was just one of many factions vying for control of China, they found it necessary to create allies with non-Communist peers. This method of receiving working with non-communists to ensure victory (in this case, a stable society) continues today. (There is a lot more to say about the role of the united front, but it’s off topic.)

The longer answer as to why these specific parties exist and why they are called democratic parties requires more knowledge of the period before and just after 1949. I think—but do not have a source for—that at least some of the parties existed in some form prior to the CCP’s victory in the civil war and believed they would be able to compete for power with the CCP in a multi-party system. This did not happen and they were given the current consultative status.

To the third point—that the parties exist because of and in relation to the CCP’s concept of “democracy”—the CCP thinks of democracy as serving the will of the people. As long as it can claim to be responsive to the citizenry, the CCP can claim it is a democratic representative of the people. Since the CCP believes it leads in the interest of the people, then China is democratic.(5) Without multi-party elections there is an obviously circular logic to this, but that’s what it is.

For the CCP to be responsive, then, it needs mechanisms like the CPPCC to collect feedback and hear complaints, and it allows groups like the democratic parties to exist. To be thorough, I’ll note that there are many other feedback mechanisms and even elections are held at the most grassroots level of Chinese society.(5)

680,AskHistorians,What happened to Henry II's jousting opponent after accidentally killing him in 1559?,"Henry died in a joust against the captain of his Scottish Guard, Gabriel, the Count of Montgomery.  The fateful run occurred at the end of a tournament day, after Montgomery had almost unhorsed the king.  Henry instead on another tilt.  Montgomery's lance struck the king's helmet and shattered, with a long splinter running through the king's visor through his eye and into or near his brain.  The king initially survived injury, and was attended to by two of the most celebrated physicians in Europe, Ambroise Paré and Andreas Vesalius.  The queen, Catherine de Medici, ordered four prisoners executed with wood driven into their brains so that the physicians would have the chance to study the king's wound in detail on the corpses.  Despite this rather extraordinary measure, the king deteriorated steadily.  Vesalius' personal account is consistent with the development of meningitis or encephalitis.  After 11 days, the king died.

During these 11 days, Montgomery is supposed to have come to the king's side, and asked to have his head and right hand cut off in punishment.  The king told him that he had jousted well and bravely and that the accident was not his fault.

Following Henry's death, Catherine essentially ruled through a series of three of her sons.  Montgomery retired to his estate in Normandy.  From there, his history gets a bit complicated.  He converted to Protestantism and took part in the religious fighting in Bourges and Rouen that followed the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572.  He escaped to England and remained there for about a year, later returning to attempt to lead a Huguenot insurrection in Normandy.  He was captured by royal forces and executed in 1574.

681,AskHistorians,How soon after the Salem witch trials did people realize it was not about witches?,"Ok- there's a lot to unpack in this question, so I'm going to start with ""not about witches"" because it both is and it isn't about witchcraft.  Witchcraft was a reality in the 17th century world.  A witch was someone who made a deal with the Devil, and they could then send their supernatural form- their specter- out into the world to cause harm.  New England in 1692 was very much a world of wonders- the devil was fighting to dominate the Puritan world and lure people into temptation, thus gaining their souls for Hell.  This battle between good and evil happened daily in large and small ways.  Individually, it was your responsibility to adhere to Puritan tenets, and collectively, everyone needed to ensure each individual did.  One person's spiritual failings could bring tragedy to a town by invoking a storm sent by God as punishment.  It was a scary world, and even scarier when your neighbors might betray you and your community for the devil.  In this way, it was about witchcraft.

&#x200B;

But finding a witch is where it gets to not be about witchcraft.  I'll focus on the Putnam family to explain this.  Thomas Putnam Jr.'s daughter Ann Putnam Jr. named more people than anyone else with 83 confirmed accusations.  I've counted 893 unique accusations against 177 people so she makes up a fair amount as a twelve year old.  There is a long history of the Putnam family's decline in local politics and a number of family and community feuds that pit the Putnams against a lot of other people.  Many of Ann Jr.'s accusations line up with people on the other sides of those feuds- allies of local opponents to Thomas' political agenda, people on the wrong side of a lawsuit with the Putnams, easy targets that have some benefit for Thomas if accused.  Thomas Putnam Jr. had the most to gain from a lot of the accusations and his daughter often pointed the finger, if not pointing the finger first.

&#x200B;

However, this isn't to say the accusations are a premeditated conspiracy.  Yes, Thomas and his allies all have daughters and family making accusations along political factions.  But this doesn't mean Thomas, Rev. Samuel Parris, and others had meetings to say 'lets accused her, her, and her, so then we can accuse him.'  Its not a pre-planned witch hunt because you can't plan this.  Witch hunts most often found 1 or 2 suspects at a time, but in 1692, its a conspiracy of witches in the minds of these overzealous and self-righteous murderers.  They build a narrative as they go by taking confessions naming others and running with it.  Other towns had political issues and family feuds where someone nearby realized 'hey, we can do that too'.  But this doesn't mean they didn't think Sarah Good or Rebecca Nurse weren't witches.  They might have, although we can't be certain and I'd guess not everyone on the accusing side fully believed it.  This is what the thought process became- witches are real, there are witches here, who are they?  We don't like this person, they must be a witch because why else would they oppose us in local church politics.  The people you hate are the people you believe are witches.

&#x200B;

This is the scenario I imagine for how the accusations take off- the afflicted person started to suffer, people in the room begin to ask ""who is afflicting you?  Is it Martha Corey?""  This offers the accuser a name that they can just agree to, or in the case of younger accusers like Ann Jr., they probably know someone the parents hate.  Houses were small, often one or maybe 2 rooms.  If mom and dad sat up late by the fire complaining about Sarah Osborne, the children will hear the name and at the right time, Ann Jr. knows what her parents want to hear.  In many of the cases, its reasonable to believe the names were indirectly fed to the accusers to start an accusation.  After an arrest, more of the afflicted would jump onto an accusation since a accused witch was implied to be inherently guilty- specters of witches could only appear if you were a witch- so naming them gave credibility to other accusations.  It was a self-reinforcing cycle of accusations.

&#x200B;

Now onto the question of when people realized it wasn't about witches, and simply put, there were always people who knew.  On the day of the first examinations (a pre-trial hearing after an arrest to decide if a trial is necessary) Martha Corey tried to prevent her husband Giles from attending because she disagreed with the idea (she later hanged for witchcraft and Giles was infamously pressed for standing mute at his trial).  The Porter family, the leaders of the faction opposed to the Putnam faction, mounted a defense for their friend and ally Rebecca Nurse immediately writing a letter to the magistrates.  Nurse's sister Sarah Cloyce walked out of church when the minster referred to Rebecca's infiltration of the church as a witch. Another sister, Mary Easty helped the Porters circulate petitions on Nurse's behalf.  Cloyce was accused and arrested.  Easty hanged alongside Martha Corey, a few months after Rebecca hanged.  From the outset, people knew but accusations followed outspoken advocates.

&#x200B;

It was only as the increasing number of trials and executions continued that public sentiment grew more and more against the trials.  By September, the Court of Oyer and Terminer started to rush through cases because of the number accusations and because it seemed like their popularity was draining fast.  11 executions over the summer followed by 8 more and a pressing that month helped turn the tide.  There were also figures in Boston beginning to pushback- ministers like Revs Willard and Moody in Boston's Third Church even helped Philip and Mary English escape.  Critics like Thomas Brattle started to write down their thoughts, some things were published during the fall but many of the critiques were published much later.  Brattle, Calef, Maule, and Willard all have publications from the era that were critical of the trials.

&#x200B;

These critiques also came as more members of the Boston elite faced accusations.  Rumor even spread through the city that Lady Mary Phips, wife of Gov. William Phips, was named.  We know the rumor spread but not if anyone actually accused her.  But with that rumor, with a feeling that King William III would disapprove, and with public sentiment changing as influences like Rev. Increase Mather started to call for more caution, Gov. Phips paused the trials to reevaluate spectral evidence.  When the trials resumed without it in January 1693, convictions were virtually impossible.  There were no witches.

&#x200B;

Some people did apologize years later.  In 1697, Judge Samuel Sewall apologized for his role on the court.  His repentance was lasting and generally true.  He even wrote against enslavement later on after realizing his mistakes.  (However, his brand of anti-slavery was based on keeping races separate so we shouldn't be too impressed with him.) Ann Putnam Jr. confessed in 1706 that the accusations were a deception by the Devil.  Her apology is much more of a non-apology since it seems to be more about protecting her local standing by fighting the stigma of her involvement.  Still, she is the only accuser to seek forgiveness, but she placed the blame on Satan and not herself, other accusers, or the family members that pushed her to accuse.

&#x200B;

In 1711, a Reversal of Attainder exonerated many of the convicted suspects- most of those executed and those convicted but in jail at the time of the pause and reprieved.  It also gave some reparations to families of the victims related to money spent for jail fees and other related expenses.  In 2001, Massachusetts exonerated the remaining victims who were not previously granted a reversal.

&#x200B;

Now, one last note to respond about the land- sorta.  There were financial motives for some people, but not many.  Accusers and their families had no direct access to land or property, but the sheriff certainly did.  George Corwin arrested a lot of the accused suspects, but was also responsible for collecting jail fees (you basically rented you spot in jail and the chains used to hold you).  When suspects were convicted, Corwin didn't always stop looting property- the Elizabeth Procter escaped death due to a pregnancy while her husband hanged.  Corwin took almost everything from the house.  Essentially, movable goods were up for grabs to him but the land itself was rarely at stake except if there would be no heirs.  But accusations in no way guaranteed anyone could get land if someone hanged for witchcraft.

682,AskHistorians,"The US Constitution was signed in 1787, and the American Civil War broke out in 1861; is there a census of how many people were alive through that 74 year span? Do any interviews exist of the generation that lived through the birth of the Union and it's near collapse?","This question was actually asked - and at least partly answered - by an amateur historian named Elias Hillard in 1864. 

He found [at least 6 men who had fought in the Revolution and were alive during the Civil War](https://blogs.loc.gov/picturethis/2013/11/the-last-men-of-the-revolution/). He photographed and interviewed them, and published it all in a book called [*The Last Men of the Revolution*](https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchCode=LCCN&searchArg=05034062&searchType=1&permalink=y).

All 6 men were over 100, and you can read what Hillard wrote about each [here](http://www.americanrevolution.org/lastmen.php). It's fairly dense prose, in a mid-19th century style, but fundamentally each is an interview in much the same fashion as you might find today. 

This obviously isn't a full census, but I think it does answer the interview part of your question?"
683,AskHistorians,Did Roman soldiers ever fatten themselves up to carry extra calories for long marches?,"The answer to this is *probably* no.

We know Gladiators were reasonably chunky to display ""show wounds"" since cuts to fatty areas wouldn't be debilitating and would also bleed a lot. They also were less likely to get infected.

Roman soldiers were different. They trained *constantly*, just like the modern military, and when they weren't training they were performing maintenance, logistics, etc. Or being employed in construction. They were short, stocky, and mostly solid muscle.

How do we know they (probably) didn't fatten up for campaign?

Well, for one we know they ate extremely healthy diets but high calorie diets. Foods high in fat were recorded to have caused intestinal distress among the soldiery on campaign. Lentils, Olives, Raisins, Dates, Nuts, and Bread (Grain, barley, oats, spelt, rye) were the staples of the legionary diet, usually with a salt ration and a pork or fish ration, and then other things they could occasionally pick up like Carrots, or Pepper (if they could afford it), or the like. They also all had worms, and this diet probably helped make that less problematic.

It's also largely backed by studies on the bones of deceased soldiers and animals, which showed that although they ate a variety of meats ranging from fish, poultry, and pork (the most common) to everything from vole to otter to wolf. They also probably broke bones open for the marrow to make stew with. But it's also worth noting that analysis of bones also showed a primarily grain-based diet, which probably composed more than 60 to 70% of their meals.

Another reason, which isn't usually talked about, is how *small* the finds of armor are. The Corbridge hoard segmentata's original dimensions will not fit pretty much any reenactor except the ones who are like 5'4. It's not the only case, either. The surviving muscle cuirasses are also too small for modern reenactors in their original dimensions. Tunics are also indicative of this - most of the surviving adult tunics were made for people slightly over 5 foot in height. Although tunics don't give much evidence in terms of weight.

Finally, it's worth noting that while ""fattening up"" for campaign makes sense for other cultures who would have to bring all their food with them at the beginning of the campaign and rely heavily on foraging and looting, the Romans had continuous supply chains with granaries (*horrea*) placed at specifically distanced intervals purely for the purpose of having a continuous, uninterrupted supply. In major campaigns outside of the empire, they would stock up ahead of time and carefully guard baggage routes to transport food and supplies constantly. Julian was relying on barges to transport grain down the Tigris and Euphrates to supply his campaign to Ctesiphon in 363.

So it seems extremely unlikely that soldiers would do this based on what we know, but there's a lot we don't know and we can't rule it out entirely. But overall my judgement is ""most likely no.""

(**EDIT:** Okay since I'm getting a TON of questions about this in particular, [Intestinal Worms were rampant in the Roman Empire](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0031182015001651). This was because most provincial baths were never drained when the plumbing clogged, they used human fertilizer on all their fields without using complex composting to kill the eggs, and they loved *garum* which is a fermented fish sauce that spreads marine worms, most of which don't infect humans but some which do, namely tapeworms. As a result, worms were *far* more prominent than in the iron age or middle ages.)

(**EDIT 2:** Yes people in ancient Rome were shorter. Vegetius states the ideal height for a soldier was about 5 foot 8 inches, but in reality the average height for a male in ancient Rome was about 5 foot 5 inches based on skeletal studies. This is largely due to diet. The modern diet is much higher in protein, etc. which allows us to grow to much larger builds. They weren't much different from the worldwide average.)"
684,AskHistorians,"How long after the rise of Augustus did it take the average citizen of Rome to realize that they no longer lived in a Republic? Would it be clearer to patricians than it was to equestrians or plebs? Were there any expressions of dissent, and if so, what were the consequences for the dissenter?","Hi!  I wrote about this a while ago, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/69atc7/after_the_reign_of_augustus_were_there_ever_any/dh5n0an/).  The TLDR, Tacitus was writing about a century after Augustus died, and that's where we get the idea that the Republic fell, but it's a problematic idea, because what a republic was meant very different things to different people, and some people (Cicero for instance) thought the Republic was falling all the time.  The idea stuck in the modern conception, I argue, largely because of Hitler.

I'm happy to field further questions, if any pop up."
685,AskHistorians,"Why is the ""spiked golden ring"" depiction of crowns so ubiquitous when many real-life crowns seem to have a different shape?","Aha! A subject I have knowledge of! The difference you are seeing between the ""common depiction"" of a pointy crown and the ""search result"" of a crown with arches stems from a variety of sources. 

And let me start by limiting our scope; I am only going to speak of crowns from the European Christian tradition. There are numerous examples of crowns and ceremonial headgear from cultures outside of the European Christian tradition that will be different and not relevant to my discussions.

To start out with, there needs to be a distinction made between different types of ""crowns"". Type and ornamentation of crowns has historically been limited both by the rank of the wearer, and the occasion of wear. Specifics could vary significantly over place and time, so I'm going to be working with more general design features.

The arched crown (what you called a domed cage) is what is most properly called a ""crown"". Its wear is restricted to currently reigning monarchs (\*with an exception for the Virgin Mary). Probably the best-known example is the British [St. Edward's Crown](https://www.hrp.org.uk/tower-of-london/history-and-stories/the-crown-jewels/#gs.8yf892).  (Papal mitres/tiaras also share an ancestor with domed crowns, but that's a whole other post!)

The ""spiked crown"" and all its variants, are most properly called ""coronets"", literally small-crowns, defined by the lack of domed arches. These could be worn by reigning monarchs, heirs, and varying degrees of nobility.

In the modern European tradition, the arched crown is often worn with a velvet and ermine cap called the ""Cap of Maintenance"". Although it is most often displayed with the crown, the cap is properly a separate piece. 

Studying the history of crowns is complicated not only by the relative scarcity of these objects, but by the fact that a large percentage of extant pieces which have survived from medieval or pre-medieval times have been passed down and used by rulers for centuries, and been reworked and repaired numerous times.

The earliest hard examples of a crown in the European tradition can be traced back to the Byzantine Empire. These consisted of a wide and heavily ornamented ring. [Here is an image of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Meister_von_San_Vitale_in_Ravenna.jpg/800px-Meister_von_San_Vitale_in_Ravenna.jpg) Justinian ruled from 527-565ce. The image is from a mosaic in a church in Ravenna, Italy, and dates from the 6th century, so roughly contemporaneous to his rule. 

An extant example of this style is the [Iron Crown of Lombardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Crown_of_Lombardy#/media/File:Iron_Crown.JPG), which resides in Milan, Italy. The Iron Crown is a ""reliquary"" crown - legend says it was ordered to be forged by St. Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine, and contains a nail of the True Cross.  Already in the European royal tradition, crowns are associated with Christianity and the Divine Right to rule. 

Dating of this piece seems to indicate it was assembled of separate components dating to the 4th-5th century CE. The Iron Crown was used as a coronation crown for the Kings of the Holy Roman Empire, including Charlemagne. It continued in use until the 19th century, with it last crowning Ferdinand I. When not in use for coronations and funerals, it was held safe by church officials.

The first ""arched"" crown seems to have been developed around the 11th-12th century. Two examples survive from this time. The first is [the Holy Crown of Hungary](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/A_Szent_Korona_el%C3%B6lr%C5%91l_2.jpg). The enamelwork plaques are of Byzantine make, and indicate the crown was gifted from the Byzantine emperor Michael VII Doukas to Hungarian King Geza I \~1070CE. The rest of the crown, however, shows signs of reworking. It likely reached its final form in the 12th-13th centuries. It probably began its life looking closer to the Iron Crown of Lombardy. It was used to crown monarchs until the early 20th century. 

The second arched crown of this era is the [Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Holy_Roman_Empire_Crown_%28Imperial_Treasury%292.jpg). It seems to have suffered from fewer repairs over the centuries. It has only a single arch crossing the dome of the crown, and the solid arched panels are suggestive of Byzantine design influence, though the crown itself was most likely manufactured in Germany. It dates roughly to the late 10th-early 11th century. It was used until the fall of the Holy Roman Empire.

Holy Roman Emperors continued to use a arched crowns throughout the course of the Empire. [Portrait of Frederick III (1468)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor#/media/File:Hans_Burgkmair_d._%C3%84._005.jpg) [Imperial Crown of Austria (1602)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Imperial_Crown_of_Austria_%28Vienna%29.JPG)

The earliest reference I can find for the use of an arched crown in Britain is a [coin from the reign of Henry VII Tudor](http://publish.illinois.edu/canderson/files/2015/11/Henry_VII_groat.jpg). His son [Henry VIII](http://publish.illinois.edu/canderson/files/2015/11/08henry81.jpg), and granddaughter [Elizabeth I](http://publish.illinois.edu/canderson/files/2015/11/Elizabeth_I_in_coronation_robes.jpg), both wore arched crowns for their coronations. The arched crown is not attested to in England before the Tudor era, and may reflect a deliberate choice to separate their dynasty from that of their predecessors. By the end of Elizabeth's rule, the modern form of the arched crown has appeared. This portrait of [James I](http://publish.illinois.edu/canderson/files/2015/11/800px-James_I_of_England_404446.jpg) may show the first iteration of the St. Edward's Crown. 

The original St. Edward's Crown does not survive; it was stripped of jewels and melted down under Oliver Cromwell. Here is [Charles II](http://publish.illinois.edu/canderson/files/2015/11/Charles_II_of_England_in_Coronation_robes.jpg), wearing a recreated St. Edward's Crown for his coronation. This is the same crown I linked to in the beginning of this reply; over the past 4 centuries it has been reworked and modified for successive rulers many times. It supposedly contains pieces of the pre-Cromwell crown, which may be true.

Outside of Britain, the use of arched crowns seems to have gained popularity in the 16th century. [The Crown of Eric XIV of Sweden](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Royal_crown_of_Sweden.jpg) was created in 1561. The [Crown of Louis XV of France](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Crowns%2C_Mus%C3%A9e_du_Louvre%2C_April_2011blackened.jpg) was created in 1722. The [Corona tumular](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Spanish_Royal_Crown_1crop.jpg) of Spain was commissioned by Carlos III \~1766, but has literally never been worn.

Outside of coronation regalia, arched crowns were confined to use in churches and cathedrals, as votives to adorn statues of the Virgin Mary. The Virgin Mary, as ""Queen of Heaven"" was entitled to wear an arched crown, like any other sitting monarch. This extended even to colonial areas; the [Crown of the Andes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Crown_of_the_Virgin_of_the_Immaculate_Conception%2C_known_as_the_Crown_of_the_Andes_MET_DP365520.jpg) was created for a Mary in Popoyan, Columbia. In the 1800s, Queen Isabella II of Spain donated her [diamond and topaz crown](https://brocantevintage.tumblr.com/image/149497639040) as a votive to the Virgin of Atocha in Madrid. 

I'll make a separate post to discuss some of the history related to coronets, as this is already running quite long."
686,AskHistorians,"Napoleon invaded Egypt with 30.000 man by sea, the British navy destroyed their ships and they were stranded. After a while Napoleon bailed on them, went to France and eventually took power. What happened to the stranded troops?","Napoleon abandoned his army because he assumed the adventure was doomed. However, he did not become a pessimist until well after the British fleet sunk its counterpart. It was the Siege at Acre and the outbreak of plague that forced Napoleon back from a conquest of Syria and Turkey. 


There are many good books written on the French left in Egypt, including one by Strathern. The army largely suffered as soon as it landed in a climate that was too hot, dry, and hostile for the French to adequately deal with. The army came well-prepared to win a set piece battle and feed itself. What the army lacked however were large numbers of cavalry, especially light cavalry essential for reconnaissance and requisitioning the countryside. 


**The French tried to make the climate less hostile thru cotton and paper.** Napoleon applied his best efforts to win the 'hearts and minds' of the citizenry in Cairo, which included tens of thousands of pamphlets and other paper proclamations (invariably claiming Napoleon was actually there by invitation from the Ottoman Sultan who took pity on his people oppressed by the usurping Mamelukes). His successor by contrast did one even better, converting to Islam and 'going native'. But French efforts to become popular in the land they just conquered were tone deaf, inhibited by language and religious differences which led to peasant revolts mirroring the vast rebellion in Cairo that Napoleon had brutally suppressed before. 


**Once Napoleon left, things got weird.** The British fleet, Sir Sydney, various Mameluke Beys, and the Ottoman military never gave up harassing and attacking the French in Egypt. There are reports of plague and famine, hunger and atrocities. It is a testament to the high-quality of the French army that with and without Napoleon, it generally won any set piece battles against either Egyptian peasant, Mameluke or Turk. However, when the British landed a large expeditionary force of European Neapolitans and redcoats, I think the French finally realized they were truly cut off from the homeland. There was no breakout attempt; just a tame surrender. 


**The survivors were repatriated to France** at the end of the War of the Second Coalition. Surprisingly enough, there was less animosity against Napoleon for his desertion than you would think, likely due to his control over the presses and his ability to link his coup and French European successes as integral to the repatriation of the Egyptian expedition. But Napoleon also sent many of the soldiers back on another colonial misadventure, this time to Haiti where many of the soldiers died of Yellow Fever (which incidentally only arose from Africa in the 18th CE, which explains why Cortez and Pizarro succeeded where the French later failed). Perhaps Napoleon found them an inconvenient army."

688,AskHistorians,How did a set of political 1950s novels become so widely adopted by high school curriculums?,Followup question: When did these novels become standard parts of the curriculum?  And what did American students read before these novels?
689,AskHistorians,I realised I do not know about how Rome end up conquering Greece. What was the relations like before Greece was conquered? What was the process like? Who were their principal opponents? Did cultural similarities play a role?,"In his *Histories*, Polybius wrote extensively about how Hellenistic Greece came under Roman dominion during the 100s BCE. Based on contemporary sources, including Polybius and Timaeus, modern historians agree that Roman involvement in Greece started with no intention toward conquest or empire-building; the Romans were instead attempting to maintain the balance of power in the eastern Mediterranean and support their allies and trade partners during a period of unstable and unpredictable alliances and dependencies in the Hellenistic world.

Hellenistic Greece was a loose alliance of independent city-states until it was united by Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, in the 300s BCE. After Alexander’s death, his vast empire was split into several warring factions. Foremost among these were Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire (based in modern-day Syria/Anatolia), and the Kingdom of Macedon, while the Greek city-states largely returned to self-rule. 

The Romans first entered conflict with Macedonia during the 2nd Punic War, when Philip V of Macedon allied himself with Rome’s foremost rival for domination of the western Mediterranean, Carthage, and its great general Hannibal. Rome sent troops to Greece primarily to prevent the Macedonians from joining their armies to Hannibal’s; the conflict was largely indecisive.

Roman involvement in Greece began in earnest following a succession crisis in Ptolemaic Egypt. As Egypt fell into civil war, Macedon and the Seleucids entered an alliance to divide its Greek territories between them. Fearing this powerful alliance, Roman allies in the Greek city-states of Pergamum and Rhodes sent ambassadors to the Roman Senate requesting intervention. Rome initially intervened diplomatically; when Philip of Macedon ignored the demands, the Romans sent a large army which decisively defeated the Macedonians. Rather than consolidating power in the region, the Romans declared the ‘Freedom of the Greeks’ and withdrew their forces.

With Macedon and Egypt now weakened, the Seleucids were the major power in the eastern Mediterranean and sought to conquer Greece themselves. Once more Rome dispatched the legions to Greece, where they defeated the Seleucid forces decisively, pursuing them across the Aegean and into Anatolia.

The Romans declared war on Macedon once more when Philip’s son Perseus attempted to reassert Macedonian hegemony over Greece. The Roman legions defeated the now-outdated Macedonian phalanx; this time Rome divided Macedon into four client republics, establishing Rome’s first permanent territory in Greece.

Shortly thereafter, a pretender to the Macedonian throne attempting to reinstate the kingdom led to a fourth war in Macedon. This time the Achaean league, an alliance of Greek city-states centered around Corinth who feared Roman hegemony, joined the Macedonian side. The Roman legions once again resoundingly defeated the Greek forces, razing Corinth to the ground. This time the Romans elected to remain permanently, dividing the conquered territory into two new provinces: Epirus in the north and Achaea in the south.

Even after the Battle of Corinth and establishment of Roman provinces in Greece, the region remained an alliance of largely independent city-states and kingdoms with varying degrees of independence from Rome. There were several uprisings against Roman hegemony, including one led by Athens that was crushed by the Roman general Sulla. This remained largely the status quo for the next two centuries until the establishment of the Roman Empire, when the region was reorganized into provinces explicitly under Rome’s control."
690,AskHistorians,"In Gangs of New York, there's a scene where Irish immigrants disembark the boat they traveled to America on, sign one paper giving them citizenship, and another enlisting them in the Union army. Were new immigrants enlisted this easily? Did this affect immigration?","Gangs of New York has *many* historic inaccuracies, and this scene in particular is one of them. First, it perpetuates a popular myth that immigrants, especially Irish Catholic immigrants, were the bulk of rank and file in the Union army. To quote James McPherson:

>""The substantial number of immigrants in the Union army gave rise to longstanding southern myth that ""the majority of Yankee soldiers were foreign hirelings."" But in fact quite the opposite was true. Immigrants were proportionately under-represented in the Union's armed services. Of some two million white soldiers and sailors, half a million had been born abroad. While immigrants therefore constituted 25 percent of the servicemen, 30 of the males of military age in the Union states were foreign-born. Despite the fighting reputation of the Irish Brigade, the Irish were the most underrepresented group in proportion to population, followed by German Catholics. Other immigrant groups enlisted in rough proportion to their share of the population.""

McPherson notes that those who enlisted or were drafted into the Union army tended to be disproportionately Protestant and skilled laborers or farmers, not working class Catholic immigrants. Which would make sense because especially in a place like New York City the latter groups tended to be extremely loyal to the Democratic Party and suspicious of a war effort largely run by Republicans such as Lincoln and Seward. Indeed, it was the Democratic Party that promoted the ""rich man's war, poor man's fight"" slogan in political debates over passing the 1863 Draft Bill (the passage of which led to the July 1863 Draft Riots in New York City, which are depicted in a historically distorted and whitewashed form in the film). For what it's worth, according to McPherson 98 percent of the men drafted in heavily Irish-immigrant districts ended up paying commutation fees or hired substitutes (mostly though Democratic political machine Tammany Hall funds).

That's some background. I slightly sidestepped the question as to whether the scene in the film actually happened. It seems like Scorsese is depicting the scene mostly as a metaphor for the myth mentioned above, ie, that immigrants ""fresh off the boat"" were signed up to serve in a meat grinder (hence the coffins being unloaded right next to the fresh volunteers), so I don't think the viewer is supposed to take the scene as the literal truth.

I've downplayed the role that Irish immigrants played relatively speaking in the Union army, but (as McPherson himself admits), there were notable exceptions, most notably the Irish Brigade, raised in New York by Capt. Thomas Francis Meagher and Corcoran's Legion formed by Colonel Michael Corcoran (both were Irish immigrants and connected to the Fenian movement). 

It looks like the recruiting scene is a reference to recruiters outside Castle Clinton: the National Parks Service said that recruiters were located here to recruit recent Irish immigrants, but they are vague as to if this was before the Civil War, or before. 

However, Irish historian and archaeologist Damian Shiels (who wrote *The Irish in the American Civil War*) looked at the recruiting in this area and found a letter where the New York Commissioners for Emigration explicitly banned the New York County Volunteers Recruiting Committee from recruiting in Castle Garden (specifically because it would spread the idea that new immigrants were being duped into joining the Union Army, and the bad international press this could cause). 

Shiels' takeaway is therefore: 

>""The more I investigate the Irish experience, the more apparent it is that the type of incident portrayed in Gangs of New York rarely, if ever, occurred. Far from being duped, it was much more likely that many of these men had travelled to the United States with the express intention of joining the military, in the hope of benefiting from the financial rewards available for doing so. This was the primary motivation for Irish enlistment in the Union Army from at least 1863 onwards. These men were not stupid- they came from a country where enlistment in the British Army for economic reasons was commonplace, and they came informed about the Civil War.""

691,AskHistorians,"Native Americans in what is now the USA have often been portrayed as having ""idyllic"" lives before Western colonizers arrived - is there any truth to this? How much ""easier"" were their daily lives? Before Western diseases and colonists arrived, was it a life of easy hunting and simple living?","#Part 1

While I generally agree with /u/retarredroof that being more specific will yield a better chance to analyze a situation, I think we can paint a broad, yet somewhat accurate, picture by looking at several different instances. To start this picture, we can look back on several past answers I've written for previous questions.

* [Is there a recognized ""Native American"" philosophy, similar to how Western thought and Eastern thought is generalized?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8do4hf/is_there_a_recognized_native_american_philosophy/)

This answer explains that for Indigenous Peoples, we most certainly had our own understandings of philosophy and what it meant to lead a good life. This will ultimately differ from Tribe to Tribe, but it provides a foundation for understanding that while Tribes certainly do not reinforce the ""Noble Savage"" myth,^1 which is essentially what your question is getting at, there was intellectual thought and reasoning behind model conduct that individuals of Tribes were to maintain for their collective identity.

* [Was sovereignty a part of Native American political thought?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6setwq/was_sovereignty_a_part_of_native_american/)

In a similar matter, I discuss here how politics was also a very ingrained concept for many Indigenous Peoples. This is to say that life was not really ""simple"" in the sense that people just ate, hunted, and slept. Nations were maintained and doing so often required high levels of organization and structure in order to logistically provide for these needs and protect their land holdings.

* [Were Native North Americans egalitarian?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/57utud/were_native_north_americans_egalitarian/d8v5ulw/)

This answer probably has the most applicability to your question. It describes that for many Tribes, particularly my own, society overall was more egalitarian, which I think many exaggerate for being ""idyllic,"" though I also wouldn't say that isn't too far from the truth.

There are two major areas we can look at to further inform our conclusion on this matter, to access if Tribes were ""idyllic,"" or at least if they happened to be different enough that we can see varying degrees of overall prosperity. These are culture and practicality. For the first, the last link addresses this:

>What often determined how egalitarian a society was is the societal structure and resources. Many Native American communities were hunter-gatherer societies. Some were farmers. Some had a combination. However, most were communal. This caused them to have a more egalitarian society than what we see today because the ""wealth,"" so to speak, was distributed more evenly because life was organized around kinship ties and reciprocity for the well being of the whole community. This lifestyle was rooted in both cultural value as well as economic value.

>In terms of cultural value, sharing, gift-giving, and trading were all highly valued because what was given was expected to be repaid in some way later in the future (hence the ""reciprocity""). This was because resources were often limited and the gaining of resources required community effort, more than what one person could provide.

>This leads into what we could consider the economic value. Because many hunter-gatherers were nomadic or semi-nomadic, they were not able to keep vast reserves of food on hand. They needed to carry what they needed. This means that they could not sustain a population beyond a certain size. Thus, many native societies were balanced in number of births and deaths. And when there isn't a surplus of food, you are more dependent on others of your community who have also gathered enough food. This indicates that not one person was in charge of all the food. It was all shared and ""owned"" by the community. Unlike in agricultural and industrial societies, structures where mass production of resources can be carried out by a few, hunter-gatherers had to share everything in order for everyone to survive. This meant that resources, particularly food and shelter, were distributed equally. Individual wealth and prestige might differ, but not so much as to offset the balance of the society.

Beyond this, let's examine some key areas to better inform this position.

##Government

One of the most well known examples of Indigenous Government that existed prior to the United States and even colonization by European powers is that of the the Haudenosaunee, or the Iroquois Confederacy. The origin stories of their own nations give a glimpse into the social environment it was born out of and also exemplify Indigenous values that standards of the Old Ways were based off, though they were not always followed.

>The Haudenosaunee ... are an ancient people of North America. Our tradition states that our people originated in the northwestern woodlands of North America ... Our existence in these lands has not been one of absolute peace and tranquility. We have had to work hard to develop the civilization we enjoy. There was a time when or lands were torn by conflict and death. There were times when certain individuals attempted to establish themselves as rulers of the people through exploitation and repression.

>We emerged from those times to establish a strong democratic and spiritual Way of Life. The confederate state of the Haudenosaunee became the embodiment of democratic principles that continue to guide our peoples today. The Haudenosaunee became the first ""United Nations,"" established on a firm foundation of peace, harmony and respect.

>Within the Haudenosaunee, all member nations are equal, regardless of size. Within their national territories the member nations are autonomous, but all adhere to the central principles of democracy that we agreed to at the formation of the Confederacy (Akwesasne Notes, 2005, p. 26). . .

>All of this political activity is set in the roots of an ancient tradition of the spirituality of our peoples. This cosmology places the Haudenosaunee in a balanced, familiar relationship with the universe and the Earth ... This philosophy taught us to treat the Natural World with great care. Our institutions, practices, and technologies were developed with a careful eye to their potential for disturbing the delicate balance in which we live (p. 27).

The Haudenosaunee explain here that for them, before the formation of their government, they experienced many of the same problems we encountered after colonization and into our modern day. Wars, fighting, killings, and injustice did exist in various forms. These were carried out at times by Natives against Natives. **However...** The occurrence of these actions are regularly filtered through a Western lens. As the Haudenosaunee describe, they, as a people, were not governed by carnal instincts that put them at odds with others and with the Natural World. Rather, they sought to cooperate with their environment, recognizing their role in it and the balance they should maintain.

When forming their government, they based it off what would become known as The Great Law of Peace. This law, which is their constitution, provided the model conduct for their citizens to emulate. This law was provided by a man called the Peacemaker.

>The first principle that the Peacemaker set forth was indisputable to those who heard his words. He said that it has come to pass that in this land humans beings are seen to abuse on another ... From that initial explanation--that the Giver of Life (later addressed as the Great Creator) did not intend that human beings abuse one another--he proposed that human societies must form governments that will serve to prevent the abuse of human beings by other human beings and that will ensure peace among nations and peoples (p. 32). . .

>Peace was to be defined not as the simple absence of war or strife, but as the active striving of humans for the purpose of establishing universal justice. Peace was defined as the product of a society that strives to establish concepts that correlate to the English words power, reason, and righteousness (p. 33).

Here, we see a good blend of practicality *and* Culture. In order to sustain the very principles of their society, they needed to conduct themselves in accordance with this law. It is important to note that this law was not written down. It is an Oral Tradition that is [enforced by internalization of the law,](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/80eg1h/monday_methods_the_we_and_the_i_individualism/) which fosters a strong constitution in individuals of their nation. This observance is what was noticed by the colonial powers and their misunderstandings led them to conclude that their primitiveness is what resulted in their supposed nobility rather than a complex spiritual and philosophical lifestyle in which their society was dependent upon. This, of course, was encouraged due to their collective nature. They worked more on a collectivist mentality rather than an individualistic one, the latter being more common in the Western World today and which is the lens many non-Indigenous researchers regularly peer through. Their collectivistic nature is then demonstrated in the rights established for citizens of their nation: all leaders are elected democratically, councils have the power to nominate and advise elections, all citizens have full rights, all citizens can travel freely, women had all the rights as men (women even were in charged of selecting leaders), immigrants were provided protection for under their laws, individual nations of the Confederacy maintained their autonomy though separate national boundaries had been abolished. For individual internalizing this law, it can be summed up in this phrase:

>A society was socialized to the ideology that, if an injustice occurs, it is their moral duty to defend the oppressed again their oppressors (p. 38)."
692,AskHistorians,"In the early NES games from Nintendo (Ice Climber, Wrecking Crew, Kid Icarus), there seems to be an obsession with casting eggplants as evil. Did that have anything to do with the cultural zeitgeist or even deeper history of eggplants in Japan, or was someone just obsessed with purple veggies?","I don't think eggplants were seen as eviler than anything else in any NES video game. NES developers simply had the freedom to express their sense of humor, so many of them did so.

The first ""eggplant game"" released in America was probably Dig Dug II (1982). But like Ice Climber (1985), it did not cast eggplants in a negative light. You collect eggplants, among many other things, for points. There are at least eight game series for the NES/Famicom that feature eggplants in some fashion and roughly half use eggplants purely as a treasure to collect: http://sydlexia.com/eggplants_of_the_nes.htm

So why were eggplants included in so many games in the first place? Well, why not? It's not an uncommon thing to eat in Japan. And there's a certain amount of cross-pollination, where game developers were influenced by each other's works. Think of how many video games, especially in the '80s-'90s, featured a character who throws bouncing fireballs. That can't all be organic coincidence, right? And in some cases, a game designer would reuse ideas from one project to the next.

Are there cultural reasons for using eggplants as a prize? Yes, [the Japanese pronunciation for eggplant](https://forvo.com/word/%E8%8C%84%E5%AD%90/) is a homophone for ""[to accomplish/to build up](https://www.nihongomaster.com/dictionary/entry/14697/nasu),"" making it a fitting punny symbol for something that you collect for points. This play-on-words is not new and [can be seen in Edo Period artwork](https://www.mfa.org/collections/object/dream-symbols-of-the-new-year-hawk-eggplant-and-mount-fuji-217795), where it was first associated with a fortunate ""first dream of the new year"" (hatsuyume, 初夢). Eggplants still carry this symbolism today. 

[Recently the eggplant as a symbol for encouraging success, [has been mostly supplanted by KitKats](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/how-the-kitkat-became-a-phenomenon-in-japan/), but that is mostly outside the year-limit for this sub, and not exactly the same, so I'll leave it at that.]

---

Yes, some games did have eggplants as enemies. But again, why not? Wrecking Crew had enemy wrenches, but that is not evidence of any hidden meaning. The choice for enemy eggplants was probably nothing more than a convenient, wacky joke, and in the case of Kid Icarus, that is confirmed by the lead designer. The Mario Bros. series has many references to mushrooms: that you stand on, fight as enemies, eat for power-ups, etc. But these are not signs of cultural critique or expression of any particular mood of the time. Shigeru Miyamoto included them as a doorway to the fantastical setting:

>""Since the game's set in a magical kingdom, I made the required power-up item a mushroom because you see people in folk tales wandering into forests and eating mushrooms all the time,"" he added. ""That, in turn, led to us calling the in-game world the 'Mushroom Kingdom,' and the rest of the basic plot setup sprung from there."" [[source](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.239908-Miyamoto-Reveals-Super-Mario-Bros-Development-Secrets)]

We will probably never know why all of the NES art directors/developers picked such seemingly random things as eggplants, but in some specific cases, like Kid Icarus, we do:

>[Lead designer Toru] Osawa also infused the project with his sense of dark humor... For instance, the Eggplant Wizard was inspired partly by Osawa's “passion for eggplants,” and the eggplant masks found in Wrecking Crew, but Osawa also says he drew it in celebration of having received his summer bonus.

693,AskHistorians,"What would a ""Top 50 Companies of 30AD"" in the Roman world look like?","You probably know one way to answer this question for late medieval/Renaissance Europe: the Fugger and Medici dynasties both got their start in the international textile trade, moved into money management/banking when they had the funds to do so, and greatly aided their coffers through monopolizing regional mining.

There's no question that Jakob Fugger, Cosimo de Medici, and their family ""businesses"" were stupendously wealthy. But the fifteenth-sixteenth century economic world is far removed from our own in some ways, and far removed from earlier medieval centuries too. A ""Fortuna L"", to medieval people, would consist of a lot more than what we today think of as businesses.

The first major economic force outside the traditional landed nobility were the Christian religious orders. You might have heard ""The Templars were the first international bankers""; let that be an introduction into the economic and political power of monastic and mendicant orders as a whole, and more locally, many individual convents (while others, especially women's communities, struggled desperately with actual poverty).

Religious orders were so successful first and foremost because of a factor in the medieval economy we don't think about today: the economy of salvation. When rich nobles and, eventually, burgher families donated land, money, and goods to monasteries, or paid to establish a perpetual chantry at a cathedral chapel, they were doing so in exchange for a specific transactional service: prayers for the souls of themselves and their family.

Now, we talk about ""land""; what does that mean by way of economic growth and success? The obvious first level is agricultural produce. But there were other ways to exploit land. English monasteries, for example, involved themselves in building and operating mills. Mining, or rather the sale of mining rights, could help a house prosper. And especially from the early 14th century on, cash rent from tenants was the direct, desirable way to turn land into value.

The system was not an endless spiral upwards. We often talk about the Black Death as adding fuel to the fire of a late medieval fear of/fascination with death, catalyzing even further a desperation for prayers and Masses to speed one's and one's family's souls through purgatory to heaven. Well, those perpetual chantries I mentioned above--donations to a church or convent to say Masses in perpetuity for someone's soul? They were often funded by a donation of a tract of land. And if that particular plot lost all or most of its tenants to one of the waves of pestilence, no more chantry.

What gives this discussion of monasteries as economic actors a particularly *medieval* dimension is the relationship between individual communities and the international order. The actual administration of orders varied, of course, and some houses were famously independent of major orders altogether. The *Frauenstifte* of imperial Germany are one of the most famous examples there. But even among a fabulously wealthy *order* like the Franciscans, individual communities--especially women's houses--could fall into abject poverty, barely able to support themselves; meanwhile, satirical authors from England to Germany tear apart too-wealthy friars for their love of money over God.

The complexity of defining ""corporation"" in the medieval economy (as well as defining all the elements *in* the ""medieval economy,"" as noted earlier in discussions of assembly-line production of paradise-souls out of purgatorial ones) also comes into play when we consider something more akin to businesses: the crafts or trades. Individual workshops, merchant houses, and proprieters are certainly and necessarily one level of economic actor. However, in terms of economic contribution to and political power in late medieval cities, we have to think of ""corporation"" as indicating the collective trade--that is, the craft guild. Medieval guilds were not the premodern equivalent of trade unions. They served as quality control over products and services produced in a given city, in part to maintain the local craft's reputation in regional and international trade. Guilds were also primary players in the urban economies of salvation and public life, sponsoring religious events, feasts, theatre, what have you--often *competing* with each other.

Georg Christ's *Trading Conflicts: Venetian Merchants and Mamluk Officials in Late Medieval Alexandria* shows the difficulty of untangling individual from civic ""corporation"" when considering medieval economic power. Christ studies the career of Biagio Dolfin, Venetian consul to Alexandria who in official capacity traded in gemstones (which he was allowed to do As Consul), and in unofficial capacity of course also traded in wool textiles (which he had to do as, well, himself). 

From my notes, here's a great example of balancing individual profit motives with protecting the overall Venetian merchant corps: a group of merchants complained to Venice/Dolfin that the Mamluks, controlling Egypt, were levying an extra merchandise tax which was most unfair. Of course Dolfin bucked up and negotiated with the Mamluks to reduce it--while spilling to Venice back home that individual merchants (*certainly not him*) were smuggling merchandise and money sewn into clothing and hidden in other ways, so it had become necessary to levy the tax at a different point in the sales chain. Christ had to make sure he was greasing the gears (which 13th-14th century western Europe was finally beginning to understand again!) with the sultan in order to be able to win Alexandrian court cases and aid Venetian merchants overall; he also had to advocate for Venetian needs in order to preserve his status as consul.

Two patterns that have emerged in examples so far of economic powerhouses will come to the fore when we differentiate craft guilds. Here we have a nice guide to hierarchy, since London was generous enough to future historians to establish a hierarchy of its Worshipful Companies in the early 16th century. Merchants are on top, which probably doesn't come as much of a surprise. It was much more beneficial to be a trader of other people's labor than to deal directly with laborers. Furthermore, it was obviously beneficial to be involved in an industry that could take one outside the bounds (physical and fiscal) of an individual city. While there were some luxury specialty items that garnered an international clientele for the best of the best artisans--/u/WARitter has some amazing posts on the international reputations of individual armourers, especially from my beloved Nuremberg and Augsburg--throughout the later Middle Ages, the great European trade icon comes back to textiles. It's not an accident, indeed, that the Medici and Fugger banks got their start in textile trading.

The thing about textiles is, sure, lots of places have a local wool or linen production industry. Despite the predominance of northern Europe in the various steps involved to make workaday cheaper cloth (from growing wool up to dyeing), even a city like Florence, Italy, marshalled enough ground-up cheap wool production to organize an entire guild around (the *Arte della lana*). The cheap wool and fustian was produced locally and sold almost exclusively locally.

But the real reason textiles became such an important *international* trade item is that everyone wanted better textiles from somewhere else. This isn't even just European. When white traders arrived in West Africa, they didn't actually have anything to trade that the Africans didn't already have. But they *wanted* different options for products like textiles. And so with Europeans.

Thus Florence's *other* textile merchant guild enters the picture: the *Arte di Calamela.* These merchants were not involved in managing the sheep-up production of fabric. Their traffic was in luxury woolens, in producing a finished product. For the most part, they just bought fine woolen fabric from northern Europe--everyone loves the English not-quite-finished good stuff!--and brought it back to Italy to concentrate on making it from fine to finest. Crucially, dyeing the fabric was one of the most lucrative ways to add value. In fact, when you look at ship cargo manifests from the early Atlantic trade, over and over the commodities acquired are various woods used for brighter and brighter dyes! John Munro points out that Florentine luxury wool merchants could *double* the value of their purchased wool by dyeing it the most desirable (expensive) shade of scarlet.

There is *a lot* we still don't know about the medieval European economy. Michael McCormick's famous thesis in *The Origins of the European Economy,* that slavery and slave trading helped power an international European economy through our near-blackout in sources and jumpstarted the ""commercial revolution"" has recently been cast into doubt by Alice Rio (*Slavery After Rome*), for example. Horden and Purcell's suggestion that ""invisible"" local trade up and down the Mediterranean coastline served that purpose has been difficult to investigate because, well, it's invisible in surviving sources. But two things that are definitely apparent are, first, the complicated meanings of ""corporation"" in economic analysis. And second, he fact that some trades were better than others, banking could make you the real money but first you had to get the money from somewhere, and some *corporations* in medieval Europe were rich enough to buy islands--and the papacy."
694,AskHistorians,"In fantasy books, bandits seem to be a very common occurrence. So far that merchants often hire mercenaries to protect caravans. Was that really a problem in medieval Europe and if yes who were the bandits and how big were the groups?","In Anglo-Saxon England, the bounty for killing an outlaw was the same as for killing a wolf. By the late Middle Ages, this had evolved into the legal principle of *wolfesheed*: the outlaw *was* a wolf, able to be hunted and killed exactly like a wolf, legally and by any means. England wasn't the only place that so closely equated wolves with criminals: in the Norse sagas, murderers are *Ulfr* or wear wolf cloaks.

Although it is fairly common for cultures to equate criminals with dangerous animals, the link in medieval Europe between bandits and a type of animal particularly known for attacking travelers and traveling in packs is both strong and specific. Travel in the Middle Ages was dangerous business, and it wasn't just a case of humans versus animals and environment.

Overland medieval travelers faced several varieties of human threat. First--you might have noticed that university diplomas grant the holder *the rights and privileges* associated with the degree. Well, those rights and privileges [originated in the Middle Ages](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/459h5n/my_diploma_refers_to_the_rights_responsibilities/czwg7k3), and the very first one--from twelfth century Germany, even before universities existed as such--was safe conduct for students and teachers traveling between schools or between home and school. The retinue of a lord whose land they were passing through, or a band from a city, had a very very nonzero chance of kidnapping travelers for ransom--whether they could come up with the money on their own, or whether a messenger had to be sent back to their family. (The struggle to reign in robber knights and lords is an important part of the medieval political narrative--it was 
a slow and very hard-fought process). Timothy Reuter posits that noble/aristocratic robbers (including those more or less employed by them) were actually the primary danger in the Middle Ages versus ""career bandits.""

It wasn't just people and their ransom that roadside robbers would be after. When attacking merchants' caravans, wine was a popular theft item--also copper, iron, cloth, basically anything that could be sold. Remember, in many or most cases, we're dealing with people well integrated into the socio-economic fabric of medieval society. This would in many cases continue to apply to the next grouping I'll discuss.

There were also robbers and kidnappers from lower social classes who *acted like* they were legitimate groups or armies. In general, this type of banditry would rise out of a broader conflict or war, like a massive heterodox movement/suppression. The best example here is probably the *bratczycy* or ""brothers"" in fifteenth-century Hungary. They seem to have the veneer of--and claimed to be--Hussite armies but in reality were pretty much gangs of bandits. The wartime context of groups like these is key. Medieval banditry--murder, plunder, robbery, arson, rape--looked pretty much like what the average soldier did during war. More to the point, what the average soldier was expected to do and what was societally *accepted* as ""what soldiers did."" While making little difference to travelers, the attempt for a group to portray themselves as legitimate soldiers at war could matter for their own legal circumstances if caught.

And then, of course, there were indeed archetypal bandit gangs of vagabonds--maybe already outlaws where such a status existed. Feodor Glowaty's family/gang at the end of the 15C Poland lasted longer than most (about three years), so it's a good example of the sort of ""career bandit"" life as opposed to a one-time robbery or a landed robber-knight. Glowaty's group, which had about twenty members at its height, became most infamous for a massive robbery of the Rozgonyi estate, including making off with a large number of horses. They also engaged in attacks on merchant caravans and locals moving between village to village. And most famously, in 1493, they held an entire town for ransom as punishment for capturing and executing two of their members. Well, they tried to, at least. It's pretty clear the town didn't pay.

It's tempting to say that over the course of the Middle Ages, the proportion of aristocrat/servant-robbers declined and the proportion of vagabond and/or outlaw and/or desperate robbers increased. Civic criminal records show that many thieves operated on a bare survival level rather than bigger heists, and it seems reasonable that their counterparts outside the town walls might have been in similarly desperate circumstances. The agonizing long-term reigning in of wayward lords, on the other hand, operated at different speeds and scales in different parts of Europe. And as the case of soldiers/claimed soldiers demonstrates, it's not a matter of ""noble OR outlaw,"" but a sliding scale that likes to tip up and down at different times.

As far as protection, the most important thing to remember is that attack was by no means a guarantee. Travel increased exponentially over the course of the Middle Ages--both local and long distance. In other words--most of the time, it was successful, and that most of the time was enough to be worth the risk. That said, there were a couple of basic ways travelers could protect themselves. The first is probably the most obvious: travel in groups. When Ibn Battuta crossed North Africa on his way to Mecca, he was basically told, ""Nope, you're waiting until the caravan goes this year, full stop.""

It's also evident that travelers, perhaps especially merchant groups with valuable cargo, were often armed. Even at the sporadic times and places where weapon-carrying was regulated in medieval Europe, exceptions were frequently made for travelers.

Escorts are a trickier business to suss out of the sources. There are a few references to a ruler decreeing a soldier would accompany caravans between towns (especially in Italy), but in practice, this seems to have worked out symbolically far more than actually--almost a means of insurance, if cargo was stolen the merchant might be reimbursed for part of it. Italian bankers paid handsomely for military protection of their largest transports, especially if straight-up currency was involved.

Disguise was another popular method of attempted protection. By the late Middle Ages, pilgrims in medieval Europe had a distinctively coded style of dress. It might sound silly, but in fact, there are comparably few reports in sources of pilgrims being attacked--and a *whole lot* of complaining about not-pilgrims using pilgrim attire to conduct espionage, moneymaking business, or simply avoid payment of tolls at bridges and towns.

And, indeed, the final method of protection wasn't really protection at all. Jewish and Christian sources alike debate whether it is moral to just go ahead and buy back your stolen merchandise from the thieves.

Overall, highway banditry was indeed a problem in the Middle Ages, particularly in the more lucrative high-traffic areas between nearby towns or around a city. The most risk, indeed, was carried not by long-distance travelers but by everyday business. And while *homicides and robberies* flare up in legal sources, a lot of bandit activity would basically have consisted of bribes or ""paying for safe passage, wink wink."" Scholars have also suggested that roadside crime increased over the course of the Middle Ages--laws against banditry become more common proportionally; inns and hostels spring up on the roadside to accommodate/protect travelers overnight. But this only makes sense. More people traveling more often and with more money--and more to the point, more reasons to have money. "
695,AskHistorians,"Tchaikovskys 1812 overture rather famously includes cannons as an instrument. Was it ever actually performed with them at the time, and how did people react?","A few quick background bits of history before we begin. The 1812 Overture was written in 1880 to commemorate the Russian victory over Napoleon during his invasion of Russia. It was originally written as part of the festivities for the opening of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, also built to commemorate that victory. The Tsar would also have his 25th anniversary of coronation in the same year, and an All-Russia Expo was coming to Moscow, so that idea was that the piece could be used as a big part of the spectacle for these events.

I say that because the piece has become overwhelmingly associated, at least in the US, with a completely different event: 4th of July. And this association is actually one of the biggest reasons why the cannon fire is so well-known today.

I'll get to that in a minute. First, did Tchaikovsky ever hear the piece with the cannon fire as he intended?

The original idea not only included very precise cannon fire, but an additional brass band along with the pealing bells of the cathedral and other churches in the area. The cannons were going to be set up to electrical switches that would set the off at precisely the right time. This was a very complicated undertaking, but hey, the Tsar wants a big celebration, the Tsar gets a big celebration.

Except, Tsar Alexander II was assassinated in 1881, before the planned celebrations. This, along with the fact that the cathedral didn't finish on time, meant that the piece was premiered in a tent at the Expo, with no cannons or bells.

It still made an impression, though, and became one of Tchaikovsky's most well-known pieces. When he went on conducting tours it was usually on the program, most famously at the dedication of Carnegie Hall in New York, which he led in 1891. However, it seems that none of these performances, nor most of the performances in the decades after it was first premiered, featured the cannon fire as written in the score.

Part of this was practical. I am not a military expert, so someone who is could possibly chime in about 19th century artillery. There are 16 shots in a roughly two minute period in the piece. There doesn't seem to be any contemporary cannon that could be safely reloaded and fired this quickly, necessitating multiple cannons (and multiple crews). The electric switches in the original plan were devised to get around this, but that was a much more complicated proposition at the time than it would be today.

The [earliest recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLslEM4DqXo), from 1915, uses percussion instead of cannon fire, and this was the common practice for many years. Other orchestras used rifles firing blanks in their performances rather than the more cumbersome cannons. But the big breakthrough came when recording technology was advanced enough to allow overdubbing.

In 1954, Antal Dorati [recorded the 1812 Overture with the Minneapolis Symphony.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rINP5ssEAgY) They then recorded a set of muzzle-loaded cannons at West Point, and overlaid those into the final recording. Herbert von Karajan did the same in [1966 with the Berlin Philharmonic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyQc0A1liaQ)

So audiences were starting to get familiar with the concept of actual cannon fire in the piece. But to really cement it in peoples' minds, another great conductor and showman would make it part of an American tradition...

**(in case it's not clear because of the edit, this continues in my reply to this comment below)**

**EDIT:** As u/TheMusicArchivist points out, the cannons and bells in the original score are not necessarily a *musical* choice by Tchaikovsky. Since the original idea was for this to be performed as a part of a big celebration, the main point was more to make a lot of noise than for great musicality. In fact, Tchaikovsky was not a huge fan of the piece himself, saying that it was ""very loud and noisy, but lacks artistic merit, because I wrote it without warmth and without love."" It's worth repeating that he conducted many concert performances of the piece indoors without the cannon fire, which suggests that he didn't think it was a musical necessity."

697,AskHistorians,Why is Alberta Canada so densely populated but Montana USA is so sparsely populated?,"I am an Albertan and I have been a keen consumer of Alberta's history for over two decades. I think a few historical, social, and economic factors explain the population density disparity between us and our Southern neighbors.

The first thing to consider is the history of Western Canada. The original Europeans in what is now known as Alberta were almost exclusively involved in the fur trade, and the most lucrative fur producing regions were in the vast boreal forests which are primarily found North of the North Saskatchewan river. The forts along the North Saskatchewan were established fairly early and became important centres of trade and commerce. Alberta's capital, Edmonton, was established in 1795 as an important fur trading post for the Hudson's Bay Company and served in that capacity until 1891.

There was a very important expedition from 1857\-59 led by John Palliser on behalf of the British Government \(the Palliser Expedition\). He was asked to explore the lesser known regions of British North America, judge their suitability for settlement, and find new passes over the Rocky Mountains. At this time the least explored region of the continent was the vast plains between the Norths Saskatchewan River and the Missouri river. Even for natives the only reason to enter this vast area was to move across it or, more importantly, to hunt bison.

This area was also the home of the Blackfoot, who were total badasses and were constantly in conflict with their neighboring tribes \(mostly the Cree\). In 1858 Palliser was near modern Calgary and was concerned when he found out a Blackfoot tride had killed a Cree in a horse\-stealing expedition. He didn't want to get caught in the crossfire. The Blackfoot were keen to trade with the fur traders, but weren't all that sociable. They were feared by the other natives, voyageurs, and fur traders. Palliser did his best to get representatives from all tribes on his expedition to help with PR and translation. This contingent was mostly made up of Metis \(what he referred to as ""half\-breeds""\) from Red River \(modern Winnipeg\) and Lac St. Ann North of Edmonton. Despite his best efforts we was only able to track down one half\-Blackfoot, half\-Scottish guide to join him.

Note: if you are driving up from Montana do yourself a favour and check out ""Head Smashed In Buffalo Jump"" near Fort McLeod \(about 2 hours South of Calgary\). It is one of the most fascinating museums I've ever visited.

The important thing of all that is above is that the fur trade established Edmonton and the North Saskatchewan as important centres for future expansion West.

When Palliser finished his expedition in 1859 he reported back to London that the Western prairies were fertile, the natives were not as militant or unreasonable as was reported, and that there were several passes through the Rockies that could support a railway. This convinced the British government that the West could be settled. The impetus for settlement was heightened in 1867 when Canada became a country. The Canadian leaders out East felt that it was not a great idea for fledgling countries to have vast unsettled lands.

In order to facilitate settlement they needed a transcontinental railroad, which was finished in 1885. The railway took a Southerly route through what would become Calgary. This is an important factor: just as with the fur trade where all important towns were on the river, in the period of settlement all important towns were on the railroad.

The next problem was to convince settlers that Alberta was a good place to establish a new life. Canada launched massive advertising campaigns in Europe and they sweetened the pot by offering free land to settlers. This lure of free land led to a huge immigration boom from 1885\-1914.

The last piece of the Alberta puzzle is Oil. Major oil and gas deposits were found in Alberta in the 1940s and this led to a thriving industry that still supports the province 70 years on. Most of this oil is in the Northern half of the province, but the reason Calgary has 1.4 million people is that the majority of Canadian oil and gas companies \(and the Canadian divisions of multi\-national oil and gas companies\) are headquartered there. When you are in Calgary you will notice that many of the big buildings are topped with the logos of oil and gas companies.

TL;DR:

1. In the late 1700s Northern Alberta was established as an important fur trading area. The area between the US border and the North Sasktatchwan was sparcely populated by badass natives and unexplored by Europeans.
2. In the 1850s Palliser explored the area and discovered it was fertile and that there were reasonable passes through the Rockies.
3. In 1867 Canada becomes a country and is eager to establish settlers in the West.
4. The transcontinental railroad is completed in 1885.
5. The Canadian government offers free land to settlers leading to a massive population boom from 1885\-1914.
6. Massive oil and gas deposits are discovered in the 1940s.
7. Most of the companies that exploit the oil and gas establish headquarters in Calgary."
698,AskHistorians,"In a TED-Ed video circulating on Facebook, they claim that, ""Businessmen and intellectuals, wanting to be on the right side of public opinion, endorsed Hitler. They assured themselves, and each other, that his more extreme rhetoric was only for show."" Is this claim accurate?","**Yes, to a significant degree.**

One of the popular misconceptions about the rise of the Nazi Party is that it was solely a populist movement driven from below. That's true to a large degree, but the Nazis enjoyed a great deal of support from ""high society,"" wealthy industrialists, princes and princesses, as well as culturally significant figures. /u/commiespaceinvader is unfortunately ill, but he recommends [*High Society in the Third Reich* by Fabrice d’Almeida](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n07/christopher-clark/vases-tea-sets-cigars-his-own-watercolours) if you're interested in learning more. I'd also recommend Henry Ashby Turner's *German Big Business and the rise of Hitler*, even though Turner's thesis is that business *did not* in general fund Hitler's rise.

I personally don't have a copy of either, but I do have Ian Kershaw's *Hitler* as well as Richard Evans' three-volume *Reich* trilogy and Weber's *Hitler's First War* which is less helpful for this question. Evans' *The Coming of the Third Reich* has a significant amount of information about your question.

During the 1920s and early 1930s, many of Germany's big firms (I.G. Farben and Krupp were just two examples) became disillusioned with the Weimar system. As Evans writes, ""The influence it had enjoyed before 1914, still more during the war and the postwar era of inflation, now seemed to be drastically diminished. Moreover, its public standing, once so high, had suffered badly as a result of financial and other scandals that had surfaced during the inflation. People who lost their fortunes in dubious investments searched for someone to blame.""

In many cases, they began to blame big business and industry. As the parties of the left grew in influence, these large corporations sought ways to protect themselves. They turned to groups like the Nationalist Party (with whom they had a long association) and the Nazi Party, which in 1930 had undergone a split that purged the left-wing ""socialist"" portion of the National Socialists. 

In 1932, Hitler spoke to the Industry Club in Dusseldorf, appealing to the audience by denouncing Marxism and offering general industrial views. This 2.5-hour presentation didn't make much of an effect at the time, Evans writes, but it laid the groundwork for future contributions by big business. Fritz Thyssen, a wealthy industrialist, was already on board by this time, and as the Depression deepened, other industrialists began to climb onboard the bandwagon.

By the 1933 elections, Evans writes, ""Hitler was backed in his election campaign by a fresh, indeed unprecedented flow of funds from industry.""

The industrialists tended to disdain Hitler, but Hitler had allies who were more friendly, people like Goering, von Papen and Schacht. In February, Hitler delivered another address, this time to a private audience, and declared that democracy was incompatible with business interests, that Marxism had to be crushed, and that the forthcoming election was crucial to that effort. 

After that address, they paid up even though some wanted their contributions to be split between the Nazis and other conservative coalition partners. The Nazi Party wasn't alone in the 1933 election; it was part of a right-wing coalition government, and the industrialists believed that these other coalition partners would be able to moderate and control the Nazis to some degree.

With the industrialists' money, however, the Nazis were able to spread their message and champion the idea of Hitler rebuilding Germany during the Depression and restoring order in the streets from the Marxist menace. Hitler in return promised a huge program of road-building and infrastructure, coupled with tax breaks for auto manufacturers.

After the 1933 elections, leading businessmen and corporations founded the ""Adolf Hitler Donation of the German Economy,"" a program that steered 30 million Reichsmarks into Nazi coffers over the following year. This was intended to stave off the ""forced contributions"" and *de facto* extortion that the SA and local party members exerted from time to time. It didn't work very well, but Hitler helped the industrialists anyway with his program. As Evans writes, ""With the trade unions smashed, socialism off the agenda in any form, and new arms and munitions contracts already looming over the horizon, big business could feel satisfied that the concessions it had made to the new regime had largely been worth it.""

Overall, Germany's biggest industrialists and corporations supported the Nazi rise as part of their general support for conservative, right-wing government in Germany. They hoped that the other conservative parties would dilute and moderate the Nazis' influence, but the Nazis had their own plan, using this funding to push an aggressive and populist agenda that made them the leading figures in the coalition government and ultimately to one-party rule."
699,AskHistorians,"In ancient times, the continent of Africa was referred to as ""Libya"" with ""Africa"" being a small region of its northern coast. Today, Libya is a country on the northern coast of Africa. When did this change and why?","We need to draw distinction between Greek and Roman naming. Herodotus, as you say, exclusively uses the name Libya.
In book 2 of the *Histories*, he argued that the Nile Delta does not divide ""Asia and Libya"" by this argument:
> ""If, then, my judgment is correct, the Ionians are mistaken in their opinions about Egypt; if, on the other hand, the Ionians are right, I am ready to prove that neither they not the rest of the Greeks know how to count: for they hold that the world consists of three parts – Asia, Europe, and Libya – whereas it is obvious that they should add a fourth, namely the Egyptian Delta, since they do not include it in either Asia or Libya. (2.16, trans. Aubrey de Selincourt, 1954)

Interestingly, this three continent notion persisted. Isidore of Seville, writing around AD 630, stated that 
> For this surrounding Ocean flows around in a circle at all boundaries. However, it is divided into three parts: from which one part is Asia, another Europe, and a third called Africa. 

> Vndique enim Oceanus circumfluens eius in circulo ambit fines. Divisus est autem trifarie: e quibus una pars Asia, altera Europa, tertia Africa nuncupatur. (Etymologiae 14)

But this isn't an apples to apples comparison by any means. When you look at contemporaries, you find that Greeks and Romans used different names for the same place for centuries.

The Romans used a term with varied etymological explanations, variously Latinate, Hebraic, or originating in a local name. The Romans associated it with the Carthaginians and the continent generally, according to [Lewis & Short](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=Africa&la=la&can=africa0&prior=in#lexicon). The Greeks' name derives from their ethnonym for the people living on the west bank of the Nile, according to the [Great Scott](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=*libu%2Fh&la=greek&can=*libu%2Fh0&prior=h\(#lexicon).

When Polybius was writing his history of the Punic Wars in the 2nd century BC, he used the term Libya exclusively to describe activities taking place on that continent. But when the Romans added Carthage's territory to their growing empire, they named it Africa Proconsolaris (not Libya). And Cornelius Scipio's honorific agnomen was ""Africanus"" not based in ""Libya."" 

Furthermore, when Titus Livius described these same events in Latin one hundred years later, he described the same events using ""Africa"" exclusively. In the second and first century BC, we see Greeks using ""Libya"" for all land west of the Nile, and Romans using ""Africa"" to describe the same territory. Sallust used ""Africa"" for the continent as well, in his *[Jugurthine War](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Sal.%20Jug.%2089.7&lang=original)*. Throughout antiquity from Africanus down to Diocletian's designation of Diocese Africa and Justinian's reassertion of the territory as Prefectura Africa. To the Romans, the territory west of Egypt was Africa.

The Greeks persisted in using ""Libya"" in their language. 
Claudius Ptolemy (d. AD 170), the Alexandrian founder of Geography, used the Libya name as well. ""First of all, therefore, let us set down Europe which we separate from Libya by the Straits of Hercules..."" ([Prologue](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/Prologue*.html) to *Geography*). Procopius likewise used ""Libya"" in the *[Secret History](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/procop-anec.asp)* (c. AD 550). So while Justinian was reestablishing the province as Africa, Procopius was describing the event using the term Libya, parallel to Polybius describing the Romans' conquest of Carthaginian Africa. 

Muslim invaders adopted the Prefecture name, and it appears on maps consistently after the 7th century. I haven't been able to find references to a continental Libya after Procopius, so maybe someone can pick up from there."
700,AskHistorians,Why do actors talk so oddly in American 1950s sitcoms?,"So first, I need to explain that television sitcom actors from the 1950s had a wide range of dialects that was a result of their training and/or performance background. Many of the most well-known actors of the period began their careers in theatre, radio, and/or Vaudeville. Those early acting opportunities shaped much of the development of their popular characters and acting styles once they appeared regularly on a television sitcom. Broadly, actors made dialectical choices for their characters that they had been working on and refining for much of their careers. But, you are specifically asking about the ""circus carny"" sound of men and the strident quality of women in television sitcoms of the 1950s, so I'll try to address that directly.

&#x200B;

The vocal qualities you describe for 1950s television actors are addressed by Jessica Taylor in “Speaking Shadows”: A History of the Voice in the Transition from Silent to Sound Film in the United States"" (*Journal of Linguistic Anthropology* Vol. 19 Issue 1, 2009), wherein Taylor frames her analysis of dialect/speech in early American media through the frame of the film *Singin' in the Rain* (1952). Taylor's critical analysis of the premise of *Singin' in the Rain* follows the qualities you identify for female actors of the period: their voices were often perceived as shrill or strident (and thus in need of coaching or adjustment of some kind). So, it's important to note that the ears of the 1950s were perceiving many of the same qualities you are perceiving. Piggybacking on Taylor's article, I would say that characters like Lucy from *I Love Lucy* may have been purposefully working from this expected auditory perception as a way to enhance/alter the visual aspects of her character so as to create a comic affect. (Personally, I think Lucille Ball was a genius at this, but I'll defer to anyone who knows more about her career and character/vocal choices.) As Taylor identifies: audience ""expectations were, in many ways, determined by discourses around appropriate gender performance"" (10). For more on these qualities and how their affect on listeners, I would suggest reading *Women and Radio: Airing Differences* (2014) on the history of women's elocution lessons, perceptions of the female voice, and early radio technology.

&#x200B;

But back to your question: did actors *choose* to speak this way? The best answer is yes, they did. In the two sources I mentioned above, the authors do much to explain that socio-economic understandings of the early-twentieth century did much to shape the perception of gendered voices and dictated the ways in which actors were educated in dialects based upon their characters and audiences. So an actor with a background performing in Vaudeville shows was trained to reach a largely working-class immigrant audiences and would often employ dialects and accents that would reach those audiences to bring them toward a stronger comic affect. In addition to the sources above, I'll add Jane Hodson's book, *Dialect in Film and Literature* (2014) to the list of sources that explain how early film and radio had strong expectations for gendered voices that, for the most part, achieved the ""proper"" dialectal qualities of the mid-atlantic dialect (the socio-economic and cultural reasons for this are addressed--though not through an analysis of dialect--in Michele Hines' chapter, ""The North Atlantic Triangle Britain, the USA and Canada in 1950s Television,"" in *Transnational Television History: A Comparative Approach*, 2012). With the growth in television ownership across the USA in the 1950s, the sitcom format began to do much of the same type of thing that Vaudeville was doing in the early part of the century: reach the working-class American and counter the affluent sound of the mid-atlantic dialect. The same types of acting strategies that worked for comic performances 30-50 years earlier were affective choices for the TV sitcom as well. I do not mean to suggest that a certain class of Americans actually spoke like TV sitcom characters, but it is a long tradition of comedy to employ exaggerated accents/dialects that give a character the perception of being ""lower"" or less intelligent so as to elevate their audience and make it easier for people to laugh at the ridiculous situations the character finds themself in. In summary, what you're hearing from those characters is likely exactly how the actor wanted you to hear it. But, in the 1950s this vocal quality probably held a stronger affect than it does today as comic expectations and affect changes with time (but that's not to say that sitcoms on the 1950s aren't still funny!).

701,AskHistorians,"Aelfgifu (""Elf-gift"") was seemingly a fairly popular name for noble Anglo-Saxon women. What was the Anglo-Saxon conception of ""elves"" and how did it play with church doctrine?","There are two ways to attack the subject at the heart of your excellent question: by using early medieval primary sources (which are always too rare) and by considering early modern folklore collected in the North Sea area and projecting backwards (which has its own problems). At the heart of the problem with projecting backwards using early modern sources is that folklore is not monolithic, by its nature. Folk traditions, beliefs, and the narratives that express those beliefs are subject to change because there is no single dogmatic doctrine that provides an anchor from which the tradition cannot drift. Similarly, it is too easy - and error ridden - to generalize about traditions using rare early-medieval sources. The two types of evidence provide glimpses at a tradition in motion, and yet, they do point to some observations.

There is a reasonably homogeneous tradition of supernatural beings, which people believed lived in family groups and/or communities and which is documented in historic and pre-modern professional collections, ranging from wherever Scandinavian languages are spoken, Britain, Ireland, nearby islands, and Brittany.  Because this generic tradition (acknowledging enormous variation over time and geography and also a wide variety of terms for the entities) is so widespread and appears in some of the oldest documents from the area, so that it is reasonable to conclude that the roots of the tradition is pre-conversion. 

At the same time, it seems inevitable that conversion affected the tradition and shaped it over time. That said, the Church appears to have failed at the one thing it strived to achieve - namely, to group these supernatural beings together with the forces of evil. We see evidence of this effort in the passage in the Anglo-Saxon poem, Beowulf, when the poet writes that elves, like the monster Grendel, were descendants of Cain:

>From him the evil brood were all born,

>Giants and elves and evil spirits,

>And also the giants who fought against God

>For a long time; He paid them retribution for that.

That clerical point of view did not generally affect the folk tradition, which maintained that the elves (fairies, sidhe, pixies, hidden folk, or other names) were neither good nor evil. Mind you, people feared them, for they were extraordinarily dangerous and were capable of inflicting terrible harm, not the least of which was abduction, which could last for eternity and deprive the poor soul of salvation. The elves had to be treated with caution, respect, and deference, and most of all, they needed to be avoided. But they were not in league with Satan - that was a different kettle of supernatural beings.

In pre-modern collections from North Sea cultures, we find numerous explanations of the origin of the elves (with all their names), some of which are placed in a Biblical context: the elves were angels who refused to take a side in the battle between God and Satan, so they were cast out of heaven to live on earth (but not Hell) apart from the Christian struggle between good and evil; or the elves were the children of Eve who, when she realized God was coming for a visit, was only able to clean some of her children, and so she hid the others, and God answered that those who were hidden from Him would be hidden from mankind for all time. At the same time, there is a widespread legend that tells of the possible salvation of the elves: a young man is traveling through the forest and sees the elves celebrating, so he calls out and says that they have no reason to celebrate since they cannot know salvation, at which point the elves begin to cry. He goes home and tells his father what happened, and his father tells him to return with word that they will know salvation, which the boy does, and the elves resume their party. Some times the boy tells them that they have no more chance at salvation than does his walking stick have a chance to sprout leaves. The next morning the walking stick is full of leaves, and so the boy goes back and tells the elves the news.

The repeated message in these stories is that the elves are not evil, and that if they lean in one direction or the other, it is on the side of salvation. The Church, however, persisted in its attempt to say that all supernatural beings not specifically identified as being on God's side in the bible are by necessity on the side of evil - maintaining a strict division of the universe into those two halves. During the witch trials, for example, people could be accused of cavorting with the elves, with the consequence being the same as cavorting the demons. Despite that dark chapter in folk belief, the folk persisted in seeing the elves as theologically neutral, and while they were to be feared, there were also stories of these supernatural beings rewarding people of good character and generosity.

That leaves us with the odd tradition of incorporating the word ""Aelf"" into Anglo-Saxon names - Alfred, being one of the more common that descends to this time. There can be no question that people understood the meaning of these names, but that does not mean that they took them to mean that in a literal way. We have names including Rose and Marigold, but that doesn't mean that we automatically think of those flowers when we encounter those people. I knew a fellow named, of all things, Rex King (parents with a sense of humor or a lack of imagination!), and all his schoolmates no doubt understood that Rex meant king, but we didn't think along those terms when we encountered him - or at least I didn't. 

It has always struck me as odd that the Anglo-Saxon people might be summoning dangerous supernatural beings with a name that uses their name, but we have to set that aside as something that apparently cannot be resolved, and we must merely accept the fact that the Anglo-Saxon naming tradition included this word, and people did not think of it as taunting the dangerous supernatural beings.

703,AskHistorians,"Is it true that in some battles of the First English Civil War, pikemen on both sides would just ""wave their pikes around"" pretending to be fighting, and hoping their commanders wouldn't notice it?","I can find at least one contemporary attestation of this kind of thing happening, from no less authoritative a source than James, Duke of York—the future King James II—writing about the 1642 Battle of Edgehill (one of the first major battles of the First English Civil War). The quote below comes from *All the King's Armies: A Military History of the English Civil War 1642-1651*, by Stuart Reid; for the account from James, he cites Peter Young's book *Edgehill 1642: The Campaign and the Battle*.

>While it seems to have been by no means uncommon for pikemen to throw down their pikes and fall on with swords, deliberate encounters between two opposing stands of pikemen were generally conducted at 'push of pike'. This was by no means as dangerous as it might first appear, and hostile commentators such as Daniel Lupton claimed that it was virtually impossible for a pikeman to run someone through, even if he was only wearing a buffcoat. The real object of the exercise seems to have been to push the opposition back sufficiently violently to cause them to lose their footing, or better still to break and run. Nevertheless both sides needed to enter into the spirit of the occasion and, if one side was less thanm enthusaistic, the push might only be a token one with the reluctant party throwing down its pikes and giving way almost at once.

>**If neither side was too keen on the idea they might even be reduced to an ineffective 'foyning' or fencing, standing off at a pike's length and going through the motions of jabbing at each other while they waited for something to turn up**. After the initial clash the infantry battle at Edgehill in 1642 seems to have settled down into an affair of this kind:

>>When the Royalist army was advanced within musket shot of the enemy [wrote the future King James] the foot on both sides began to give fire, the King's coming on and the Rebells continuing only to keep their ground, so that they came so near one another that some of the battalions were at push of pike, particularly the regiment of the Guards ... The foot thus being engaged in such warm and close service, it were reasonable to suppose that one side shuld run and be disordered; but it happened otherwise, for **each as if by mutual consent retired some few paces, and then struck down their colours, continuing to fire at each other even until night, a thing so extraordinary as nothing less than so many witnesses as were present could make it credible**.

I have not been able to find evidence that this kind of behavior was widespread, however. Whether or not push-of-pike engagements were ""by no means as dangerous as it might first appear,"" they were often real knock-down, drag-out affairs: one excruciating push at the Battle of Torrington in 1646 is reported to have lasted *two hours*. Different sources claim different things about the typical fatality rates of push-of-pike engagements, but in some cases the pushing would give way to what was called ""bad war,"" when both sides would drop their pikes, draw swords and other close weapons, and engage in fierce, high-casualty hand-to-hand combat. At Edgehill, the foot soldiers on both sides were quite inexperienced (and, at least on the Royalist side, lightly armored), and it's possible that they were skittish about becoming engaged in this more violent and deadly phase of battle."
704,AskHistorians,"When people poisoned wells in ancient times, did it mean the permanent loss of that well? What happened to poisoned wells after a war ended?","I talk a little about the weaponization of water sources in the Middle Ages in [this earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6kt7nh/poisoning_wells_is_a_common_espionage_activity_in/djp2a5u/), from which I'll borrow for the beginning of this post. There are a few times when we hear about actual *well* poisoning as a war tactic, but scholars are frequently skeptical:

> The perilous geographic placement of Svetigrad at the tip-top of a rocky hill [was] good for defense against a siege but very bad for access to plentiful water sources. Drawing out the themes of betrayal, [the author of the primary source record] condemns a local man for knowing exactly how to crush the citizens and soliders of the town psychologically as well as physically. This traitor, the story goes, cast the corpse of a dog into the local well. The town defenders had lost their source of water, and knew they had to give in.

> Whether it really took a local traitor to poison a well or whether the Ottoman army was actually just very strategic at cutting off the defenders' access to nearby water sources is an open question...The second is more plausible, but makes the Ottomans look much more effective so would not work well for the author's polemical purposes.

The most infamous and tragic cases of medieval well-poisoning, of course, were not actually cases of well-poisoning at all. The Black Death in particular, but also other periods of violent economic/political upheaval, led to mass accusations of poison/murder against already oppressed groups--lepers in some cases, but more frequently Jews. Which, in turn, led to pogroms, massacres, and massacres-by-arrest-and-execution of the accused. But while these cases have a lot to tell us about medieval *people*, they don't tell us what people thought about wells and how they interacted with them in the aftermath of accusations.

But! As the posts in the other thread curve around to, we can get some insight into how medieval people thought about potentially poisoned wells by looking at their attitudes towards *other* poisoned/polluted/supposedly poisoned water sources. Namely, fountains and sewer conduits (including pipes). 

In these situations, we see a deep and frequent concern for their pollution with animals, dead animals, feces, sludge, and disease--sometimes by accident, especially in the frustrations of suave urban sophisticates dealing with *rustici* (hicks); but sometimes deliberately, as malicious poisoning to target one person or a whole town. What does *not* happen is wholesale destruction of the fountain or system in the aftermath of a pollution event or poisoning case.

For example, by 1262, Siena already had a surprisingly advanced water distribution system of fountains and pools, for use in drinking, bathing, and daily life as well as firefighting. That year, a woman was accused and convicted of poisoning the all-important Campo fountain. We know about this case because its financial ramifications were meticulously recorded in the records of the Biccherna, the city chancellry. These recorded include point-by-point accounts of the costs of flaying the convicted poisoner alive and then burning her. They do not include ripping out a fountain or the entire system of fountains and rebuilding them.

So if we take Barleti's story of the Ottomans' poisoning the Albanian town's well as a dramatic story (true or not): the ""narrative effect"" of the poisoning is absolutely to shut down the use of the well in the short term. On the other hand, with a longer-term outlook and (surely not coincidentally) the economics and practical logistics of rebuilding an intricate sewer/fountain system, pollution/poisoning through excrement or dead animal bodies could lead to caution and delay rather than immediate destruction.

In closing, it's worth pointing out that medieval people absolutely understood the problems of ""dirty water"" from pollution, and that dirty water could be cleansed by boiling. A 14th century letter supposedly from a Spanish doctor to his sons at university in Toulouse rattles off the local water sources that are known to be bad (wells, a river, etc), and then reminds the reader(s) not to drink water from those sources unless it is boiled (""cooked""). The danger in a spontaneous pollution/poison case, considering the commonly cited pollutants/poisons of feces and corpses, was the *lack of knowledge.*

Further Reading:

* If this answer made you think, ""Wait a minute, *pipes and sewers* in the *Middle Ages*?"", then Roberta Magnusson, *Water Technology in the Middle Ages: Cities, Monasteries, and Waterworks After the Roman Empire* (2001) is the book for you."
705,AskHistorians,"If Mulan did what she did in ancient China,what would have actually happened to her when they found out she was a female?","Alright, Hua Mulan.  In most traditions of the story she was a resident of the state of Northern Wei, the longest-lasting of the Northern Dynasties (386-535CE) of the Northern & Southern Period (420-589CE).  There are, of course, other tellings that put her in the Sui/Tang period, and certain others that put her in a nebulous “sometime in ancient and faraway musical *Chiiiiina*”… but most tellings put her in Northern Wei.

This creates from the outset some very interesting and problematic issues with the Disnified version.  For one, though Mulan and her people are indeed called to serve against invaders, it’s never specified in the *Ballad of Mulan* which invaders they’re talking about, and it *certainly* never talks about “Get[ting] down to business to defeat the Huns/Xiongnü”… because, well, the “Huns” were already there, in Northern Wei… as its emperors, officials, and population.  Northern Wei was a Tuoba xianbei state that had partially sinified itself… but was still viewed by the Southern Han Chinese (of the Liu Song and Southern Qi Dynasties, respectively) as *themselves* the barbarians.  From the *Ballad of Mulan:*

> 昨夜见军帖，可汗大点兵.

> trans: ““Last night I saw the draft posters, The Khan is calling many troops.""

From later on in the poem, after Mulan and her army has won the war:

> 归来见天子，天子坐明堂。策勋十二转，赏赐百千强。可汗问所欲，木兰不用尚书郎，愿驰千里足，送儿还故乡。

> trans: “On her return she sees the Son of Heaven, The Son of Heaven sits in the Splendid Hall. He gives out promotions in twelve ranks And prizes of a hundred thousand and more. The Khan asks her what she desires. “Mulan has no use for a minister’s post. I wish to ride a swift mount, To take me back to my home.”

The Son of Heaven is the Khan, and the Khan is the Son of Heaven.  Flibbity-flibbity-floo.  The fact of the matter is that especially northern Chinese history is far, *far* more of a cultural and ethnic melting pot than quite a few realize, or would care to admit.

So these invaders could have been the Chinese themselves, or the Tibetans, or Tuyuhun, or the Ruanruan Khannate (which seems a likely choice)… but the one thing they were *not* were the Huns/Xiongnü… because neither existed in any meaningful capacity by this point.  But ah well, I’m getting off topic…

We can infer quite a bit about the era she lived in and the likely consequences of her actions by the reactions of those around her – both her family, and later on the soldiers she’s come to lead in combat:

>可汗大点兵。军书十二卷，卷卷有爷名。阿爷无大儿，木兰无长兄。愿为市鞍马，从此替爷征。

>东市买骏马，西市买鞍鞯，南市买辔头，北市买长鞭。旦辞爷娘去，暮宿黄河边。不闻爷娘唤女声，但闻黄河流水鸣溅溅。旦辞黄河去，暮至黑山头。不闻爷娘唤女声，但闻燕山胡骑鸣啾啾。

>万里赴戎机，关山度若飞。朔气传金柝，寒光照铁衣。将军百战死，壮士十年归。

> trans: The Khan is calling many troops. The army list is in twelve scrolls,  On every scroll there’s Father’s name. Father has no grown up son, Mulan has no elder brother. I want to buy a saddle and horse, And serve in the army in Father’s place.”

>In the East Market she buys a spirited horse, In the West Market she buys a saddle, In the South Market she buys a bridle, In the North Market she buys a long whip. At dawn she takes leave of Father and Mother, In the evening camps on the Yellow River’s bank. She doesn’t hear the sound of Father and Mother calling, She only hears the Yellow River’s flowing water cry tsien tsien.

>She goes ten thousand miles on the business of war, She crosses passes and mountains like flying. Northern gusts carry the rattle of army pots, Chilly light shines on iron armor. Generals die in a hundred battles, Stout soldiers return after ten years.

She's not sneaking off in the middle of the night on a stolen horse with a borrowed saddle.  She says to her parents, ""hey, Dad can't go fight, I'm gonna go buy a horse and go off to war.""  And her parents don't try to stop her.  Yeah, sure, they're sad and all, but such is life in a time of war.  What they're *not* terribly concerned about is the fact that she's a girl.

Because the historical Mulan isn't some pale-face beauty (ok, well she *is*, but that's not her only or even most important quality.)  The *Ballad* paints Mulan as more of an Ellen Ripley-esque certifiable badass.  There's no ""I'll Make A Man Out of You"" montage in the poem, because she is beating the snot out of her fellow soldiers from day one.  Even the Khan take note:

> On her return she sees the Son of Heaven, The Son of Heaven sits in the Splendid Hall. **He gives out promotions in twelve ranks And prizes of a hundred thousand and more. The Khan asks her what she desires.** “Mulan has no use for a minister’s post. I wish to ride a swift mount, To take me back to my home.”

Moreover, there's no mid-war gender-reveal.  Instead, she reveals she ""he's"" been a ""she"" these past 12 year only after the war, and voluntarily to her brothers-in-arms:

> 脱我战时袍，著我旧时裳。当窗理云鬓，对镜帖花黄。出门看火伴，火伴皆惊忙：同行十二年，不知木兰是女郎。

>雄兔脚扑朔，雌兔眼迷离；双兔傍地走，安能辨我是雄雌？

>“I open the door to my east chamber, I sit on my couch in the west room, I take off my war time gown, and put on my old time clothes.” Facing the window she fixes her cloud like hair, Hanging up a mirror she dabs on yellow flower powder. She goes out the door and sees her comrades. Her comrades are all amazed and perplexed. Traveling together for twelve years They didn’t know Mulan was a girl.
 
>“The he hare’s feet go hop and skip, The she hare’s eyes are muddled and fuddled. Two hares running side by side close to the ground, How can they tell if I am he or she?""

Her comrades are all sorts of ""amazed and perplexed"" that this ultimate badass was a smokin' hottie the whole time, yes, but she obviously believes that there's no danger in letting them know.  No punitive action is going to be taken against her... certainly nothing like Shen threatening her at swordpoint for the crime of saving his live while having gross girl-germs.

This hearkens back to the fact that Northern Wei, for all it desperately wanted to be, was *not* totally culturally Chinese... it still had many of the social and gender norms inherited from the Asian steppes and their formerly nomadic traditions - traditions like boys *and* girls should be trained to fight and defend their home, they should *all* be capable with the horse, bow, and sword... and that it was not entirely unheard of for men and women to serve alongside one another.  

Moreover, Mulan in all her tellings serves as a paragon of the Chinese Virtue Above All Other Virtues: *filial piety.*  Sure, she's a girl, but her dad has no grown sons, and he can't effectively serve his lord... she she helps him by serving the khan on his behalf.  That is hardly something to be punished in Chinese value systems.

________

This does change - as does the story itself - if it moves to a different time period.  Chu Renhou's *The Sui Tang Romance* moves the tale of Mulan up in time to the Tang overthrow of the Sui, ca. 618 CE.  moreover, it was written in the Qing Dynasty of the late 17th century.  Now, Chu borrowed *heavily* (and copied verbatim in more than a few places) from the earlier (pub. 1633) *Forgotten Tales of the Sui Dynasty*.  Nevertheless, it is very *very* focused on the idea of suicide or ritual defacement to establish its female characters with virtue and honor equal to men.  Thus, in the tale of Hua Mulan, we first get a twist of her being found out, but by the *warrior-princess* Dou Xianniang, who tries to recruit Mulan as a man, but then pledges to keep her secret and becomes sworn sisters.  But by the end of the tale, Xianniang's father is captured by the soon-to-be-Emperor Taizong of Tang, and they surrender themselves to suffer his punishment in his stead.  Taizong sees this as a supreme act of filial piety and (in the book) commute the death sentence of Dou Jiande (in reality, no, Dou was executed), and Mulan sent home to relocate her parents.  Harsh reality sets in, however, when she discovers that her father has died, and her mother remarried.  Worse comes to worst when Taizong's ally the Göktürk Khan summons her to his capital to become one of his concubines... at which point she decides to commit suicide rather than suffer such a fate.  From Martin W. Huang:

> Her suicide is particularly baffling since at the time she is not in love or engaged with anyone and since she is only half-Chinese (her father Turkish, but her mother is Chinese).  Hegel provides the possible explanation that this is intended to be a loyalist message: “even a half-Chinese woman would prefer death by her own hand to serving a foreign ruler.”  Also worth mentioning here is Mulan’s  explanation for why she has masqueraded as a man to join the military: “Feeling ashamed that there were not many loyal subjects and filial sons among men, I decided to take the risk to dress myself as a man.”  Here Mulan is apparently blaming the incompetence of men as one of the reasons that she felt compelled to join the military.  In other words, there would have been no need for her to do so if men had been competent enough to fulfill their duties.

Yet even in this telling where her femaleness does result in tragedy, it's again not the emperor or a military officer threatening to cut her down for her womanhood... indeed, though Taizong was prepared to have her and Xianniang executed, that was *because they were captured enemy combatants*, not because they were women. (Hell, Taizong's own sister, Princess Pingyang, was leading her own anti-Sui ""Women Peasant Army"" at this same time... and I should note that the Tang rulers were themselves semi-Turkic). Rather, the issue is having her fate taken out of her own hands as a result: going from being a respected army officer, to being the concubine of a foreign lord."
706,AskHistorians,"Is it true that China could have found and colonized America first but they stopped voyaging because it was deemed too expensive, or for other reasons?","Zheng He served as fleet admiral under the Yongle Emperor. He conducted seven ‘Treasure Voyages’ with the Ming Treasure fleet, as a massive tour de force. These voyages went to various places in South East Asia, as well as India, and as far as East Africa and the Sinai peninsula [(Map)](https://sites.google.com/site/mingdynastyjslp/the-voyages-of-zheng-he). The aim of these voyages was to gain tribute from the various kingdoms considered under the ‘sphere’ of China; and thus the size of the fleet (supposedly one of the largest navies ever built with roughly 100-240 ships of various size) was impressive. The largest ships, the Treasure ships, were very large indeed, and some have argued that the largest ships in the fleet were over 100 metres long; however this is largely unverifiable, and is very questionable as it would make them at least twice the length of European vessels of the same period (thus it’s questionable whether construction of such a ship was physically possible in this period). It is much more likely that the ships were about 40-60 metres in length (still a very impressive size), in fact the Chinese built a replica ship for their museum which had a length of about 63 metres.

Zheng’s fleet collected much wealth in tribute, including some exotic gifts such as African animals such as Giraffes, the fleet also served a military purpose, as they carried a small army of an estimated 15-40 thousand men, which was often used to cow those that were not intimidated. Zheng’s voyages took place between 1405-1433, but after the Yongle Emperor died, Zheng slowly fell out of favour and the voyages ended in 1433. Not log after that, the Treasure fleet was burned, and China largely ended her foray into becoming a world-class naval power.

On to America, it has been speculated (emphasis on speculated) by certain people that one of Zheng He’s voyages was to America. This is a view espoused most popularly, by retired Submarine commander, Gavin Menzies, his argument is that China had the time, money etc to develop such a fleet, and he therefore speculates that China discovered America before Europeans, however his views basically amount to conspiracy theories, most serious academics have dismissed his claims, as Menzies produces very little evidence. His argument basically amounts to ‘Why not?’. Thus whilst I’d argue it’s true that Zheng’s voyages were remarkable, and their relatively recent rediscovery breaks certain perceptions of Ming China, it is probably untrue that he ever reached America, or Australia or New Zealand; there is simply little if no evidence apart from conspiracy theories. His voyages are very impressive by medieval maritime standards nonetheless.

Edit: After the destruction of Zheng’s fleet; the Ming Dynasty no longer had the desire to invest heavily in a world-class navy; they were instead much more concerned with internal struggles and controlling/ expanding their land borders, particularly in the South-East and in the North. As far as I know, interest in constructing a powerful navy would not take place in China until the late 19th century, during which China constructed several semi-modernised fleets which would ultimately lose to the Imperial Japanese Fleet in the first Sino-Japanese War (Despite how one-sided the conflict appears in hindsight, the Chinese fleet did pose a potential challenge to the IJN, and many in the West did not know initially which fleet would come out on top).

Edit 2: Wow, I didn't expect such a response, I'll attempt to answer questions to the best of my knowledge, using the sources in front of me ('China and the Oceans in the Early Ming Dynasty 1405-1433' by Edward Dryer, 'When China Ruled the Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne, 1405-1433' by Louise Levathes and Sextants of Beijing).

707,AskHistorians,When did taking shots of alcohol become part of drinking culture?,"Focusing on Europe and North America:

Distilled liquor starts to gain more than a microscopic presence in Europe at the very end of the Middle Ages. However, at this point, it's mostly in the hands of apothecaries prescribing it as medication. 

It's also very limited in consumption in ways very important to our purposes. The strength of hard liquor did not go unnoticed by city and imperial authorities, who (a) instituted wildly high prices to discourage significant purchase (b) actually limited amounts that could be purchased. In particular: in some places/at some times, customers of apothecaries and grocers were limited to purchasing brandy in-store, for immediate consumption standing at the counter.

But here's the really interesting thing. ""Shot"" as an alcohol-related word, in the 1500s, still refers to the *bar tab* (and in fact, for the group, not even for an individual). But ""dram,"" another modern word for...well, a shot--*dram* seems to refer to a doseage of alcohol-medicine by the end of the 16th century. The OED has a written reference from 1590, suggesting that a dram had been better than a damn years before.

So we're still at liquor as medicine, but the idea of drinking a shot and *calling it* by a word that will later come to mean our modern shot, is already present.

But as people are gaining experience with quickly drinking small amounts of distilled liquor, a second practice is becoming quite popular. One that involves swift consumption of an alcoholic drink in ways that would hopefully limit how much you would drink at once.

Around 1500+, the practice of ""pledging healths"" becomes not just wildly popular but seen as a genuine social problem. Which is to say: drinking toasts, but turning it into a drinking game and a competitive sport. People would go around the table pledging a health to which everyone would have to drink. At the beginning of the night, the point was to pledge the most clever health (a backhanded compliment to your friend's wife, perhaps?); at the end of the night, ""most clever"" probably had a...rather more relaxed meaning.

Now, pledging healths in 1517 is not drinking shots in our modern sense. But it's a step towards that sort of practice.

Different scholars will point to different points in the next 200 or so years when drinking distilled liquor becomes truly popular. Ann Tlusty lays out laws from Augsburg and elsewhere in the Holy Roman Empire at the end of the sixteenth and early sixteenth centuries that get increasingly shrill about trying to limit the drinking of hard liquor, especially brandy. (Although much of this also involves the sale of watered-down or low-quality liquor, which would either be less likely to be drunk as shots for the obviously reason, or more likely if it tasted gross).

Jack Blocker, on the other hand, puts the time frame just a slight bit later, and suggests it is especially with European colonialism in the West Indies and North America where white people become especially fond of drinking rum. Yes, very weak alcohol consumption was extremely popular in homes at this time--but it was beer. Rum and other drinks were more limited to public houses, and apparently these were pretty seedy on the whole. (In other words, you're not going to have men in robes with pipes discussing international affairs while sipping on gin and tonic, with their pinkies in the air.)

By the early 18th century, ""dram"" (at the very least) seems to signify a shot in the modern sense. In one of his satires, Alexander Pope has a character mistake someone saying drama for *dram*, and explain apologetically that there is no jenever left. I don't drink, but I am informed that jenever is a form of gin typically consumed in quick, small amounts.

So by your 1880s ball, my gentlefriend, you would definitely not be throwing away your shot."
708,AskHistorians,"When and why did people drop the word ""atomic"" in terms such as ""atomic power"", ""atomic weapons"" etc, and replace ""atomic"" with ""nuclear""?","""Nuclear"" specifically refers to reactions that involve the nucleus; ""atomic"" is vaguer because it refers to the entire atom, which includes electrons. So if you are being pedantic you can say a chemical reaction as an ""atomic reaction"" because it involves electrons being exchanged. Whereas a ""nuclear reaction"" will only involve changes to the nucleus.

This was known in the 1940s and the scientists who developed the atomic bomb preferred the term ""nuclear"" for the above reasons (and because physicists are pedantic people by inclination). However it was felt by the representatives of the US government that any publicity they did about the bomb ought to use the term ""atomic"" because ""nuclear"" was a less-well-known word, whereas ""atomic"" was pretty common. And the concept of ""atomic bombs"" predated Hiroshima considerably as an item in fiction and popular science. So the first articles and books about the bomb all used the terms ""atomic bomb"" and ""atomic power"" and ""atomic energy,"" because these were already part of the popular English lexicon, despite their being somewhat inspecific.

We can use something like Google Ngrams to pinpoint the shift. Here are just [""atomic"" and ""nuclear""](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=atomic%2C+nuclear&corpus=26&year_end=2019&year_start=1800&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Catomic%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cnuclear%3B%2Cc0), and you can see that both were used, but ""atomic"" slightly edged out ""nuclear"" until a big switch around 1955. If we narrow it down to technological categories, [like so](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=%28atomic+bomb%2Batomic+power%2Batomic+bombs%2Batomic+weapons%29%2C%28nuclear+bombs%2Bnuclear+power%2Bnuclear+weapons%29&year_start=1920&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=3), we can have a bit more confidence in the results (since we aren't going to get unrelated uses of either adjective), and once again 1955 seems to be the magic year.

What's going on in 1955? Several things, but the major trends I'd note are:

* The development of ""thermonuclear"" weapons. This by itself probably switched things around a bit, because the category of ""atomic bomb"" tended to be used only for fission weapons, with ""hydrogen bomb"" for thermonuclear weapons, but broadly speaking the entire class of weapons would be known as ""nuclear weapons"" starting in the late 1950s/early 1960s. (To clarify since someone else asked: thermonuclear means you have achieved the conditions necessary for nuclear fusion reactions to take place. It is usually only used for weapons that derive some large percentage of their energy output from fusion. All nuclear weapons _also_ derive energy from fission, and even thermonuclear weapons can have well over 50% of their energy from fission, just to complicate things.)

* The development and commercialization of nuclear power, which was a result of both the Atoms for Peace initiatives, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (which allowed for privatization of nuclear power research and the declassification of many formerly secret concepts), and so on. The ""rebranding"" of ""atomic power"" as ""nuclear power"" seems to have been about making it sound more modern, from what I can tell. 

Of course, 1955 just happens to be when they cross over, and as you can see it is not an _immediate_ shift in usage. But basically the Eisenhower era seems to be when there was a concerted effort to change the terminology, and it corresponds with the events I mentioned above fairly well. 

The shift seems to have been a conscious effort to reflect on the situation from the late 1950s onward in which ""atomic power"" and ""atomic bombs"" was associated with the somewhat crude, early generation of technology from the 1940s, but ""nuclear power"" and ""nuclear weapons"" would be used as the more specific, less-old-fashioned sounding term moving forward. Obviously it was not a hegemonic victory — we still talk of atomic bombs, though we tend not to be referring to modern technology when we do so."
709,AskHistorians,We know that medieval nobles traded portraits to decide who to marry. Did they ever send nudes?,"^^^Holy ^^^crap, ^^^I ^^^can ^^^actually ^^^contribute ^^^to ^^^something ^^^here! ^^^This ^^^is ^^^your ^^^moment, ^^^buddy, ^^^don't ^^^screw ^^^it ^^^up!

Mary Del Priore published a book on imperial letters between the Brazilian Emperor, Dom Pedro I, and his mistress, the Marchioness of Santos, Domitila de Castro Canto e Melo. Quite an interesting book, honestly, exploring their life and the Emperor's marriage with Empress Leopoldina, his first wife.

The Emperor was know, even at the time, for being a womanizer. His attempt to secure a second wife faced some serious problems for it. He liked to exercise, had a fit body and Leopoldina described him as ""like an Adonis, shadowed by a brown curly hair and beautiful black eyes"". He was also a gregarious, charming man and, well, he was the Emperor. Being successful with the opposite sex wasn't that hard to begin with.

The Empress, however, was not really know to be a pretty woman. Overweight, short, and regarded by the Emperor as someone to do ""marriage love"". Reportedly, she considered sex to be ""disgusting and unfit to a lady"". Sex was to be performed ""in silence, laid in bed, and thinking of the empire."" Like a proper Austrian princess should behave, like her mother-in-law told her she should behave. Fun, huh?

She proved herself quite a competent ruler, was loved by her people and is still regarded as an important figure in Brazilian art history. But her marriage life was probably not ideal, despite her obvious dedication to her husband and nation.

Before declaring the Brazilian independence from Portugal, the Emperor met Domitilia de Castro Canto e Melo, from São Paulo, daughter of a high ranking military officer, recently divorced. How they met is somewhat mysterious, but she was a woman that wouldn't ""pollute the pleasures of the flesh with prayer"", like Leopoldina would. A delicate mouth, green eyes, tall, dark hair, and that Brazilian body. São Paulo also had a shortage of men at the time, witch caused the female populace to become more independent and strong willed. 

Dom Pedro I gave her a mansion in the capital, Rio de Janeiro, a title, as Countess first and eventually as Marchioness, and (why the hell not) placed her as a Lady-in-waiting for the Empress.

According to Mary del Priore, Dom Pedro I ""never confused his verbs: marriage and love. Nobles of blood should only marry nobles of blood, never nobles of bed."" She describes the Emperor's life in Domitila's house as somewhere he could experience all the pleasures of the flesh and social life, where he would laugh with his friends and receive members of the court.

Now that introductions are done, the *hotter* parts of the book talk about letters between Dom Pedro, who signed them as (seriously the best translation I could come up with) Hot Little Fire, to ""Titilia"". In those letters, he would usually include drawnings of his own penis, sometimes ejaculating, or add pubic hair. Domitila would always answer in kind.

In the letters, both Dom Pedro and the Marchioness, talk openly about their sexual encounters. Mary del Priore details that the Emperor liked to send kisses to her ""thing"" (Mary's word) and to use a clear language: he wanted to orgasm, both on her and with her. Domitila played along, asked what he wanted her to wear, how she wanted to receive Dom Pedro again in her house and helped to plan soirées in her house.

Eventually their relationship ended. Dom Pedro went to back to conquer the Portuguese throne and Domitila married a rich farmer. The Empress Leopoldina, however, died aged 29, leaving 7 children and a bundle of depressing letters to her family in Europe and friends. He never saw the end of the relationship or her son take the throne.

This is my first post here, hope I'm not breaking any rules. Also, I'm not a historian, so let's hope someone can expand on this.

It is a single example, but it was the only one I could provide literary evidence to support. Dom Pedro had many women in his life, it's sometimes hard to see what is actual a proven fact and what is not."
710,AskHistorians,I was surprised to find out that apparently Mussolini was an avid reader and even considered an intellectual by some contemporaries – whereas today I feel he is often seen as quite simple-minded. How did this image change take place after the war? Has his image even changed at all?,"Mussolini was certainly an avid reader, albeit by no means an accomplished scholar, nor was he the *Homo Novus* of Fascism, blessed with the philosophical depth of Vico, the intellectual prowess of Machiavelli, the moral strength of Mazzini and the literary genius of Dante - and, of course, Garibaldi's charisma and Caesar's martial disposition. 

During the 1930s - the period when the external manifestations of the Regime became more ""manifest"", and also the period when the attitude of the Western Powers towards Fascist Italy begun to sour - Mussolini's public persona begun to increase the weight of certain ideal traits that the Regime wished to promote within the Italian population: frugality, connection with the land and with manual labor, moral integrity as a consequence of honest work rather than intellectual abstractions. This resulted in many well known images of Mussolini doing ""people things"": harvesting, bricklaying, etc. It also coincided with a very noticeable shift in Mussolini's self-representation. Looking at his early biographies, one finds various references to his education and intellectual disposition - and even a few to possible ""noble ancestors"" - but later on, Mussolini himself insisted that his parents and ancestors had all been laborers and peasants, and rather poor ones at that; pointing out for instance that his parents worked hard so the they had ""meat for the soup on Sundays"". 


Concretely speaking, Mussolini was a passably educated man for the standards of his time - especially within the political sphere. He was sufficently well read for his professional necessities as a publicist and, indeed, his professional and occupational needs remained one of the main motives behind his intellectual interests.

Mussolini had studied French in his youth - an important part of any passable education at the time - and kept some of it, as knowledge of a second language was useful for a school teacher. He had also learnded a bit of Latin and German. He further improved the latter during his Swiss stay, when apparently he produced some translations. 

That said, Mussolini had a habit of affecting a linguistic proficiency he didn't really have - as Hitler's interpreter could testify to - so that I am not sure how good those translations might have been. He could read it though.


As to his readings, since his very early twenties (and with the exception of a brief interlude back at his teacher's duty - possibly due to familiar reasons) Mussolini's main occupation had been his agit-prop and public speaker activity and later, almost as an extension of the previous one, that of publicist. 

All these things had one trait in common: read a lot, summarize the main ideas, be prepared to argue about those, skip the things which don't matter. Which, obviously, doesn't make for an organic and coherent formulation of large sprawling intellectual architectures, but was an apt and viable method for Mussolini's practical needs, as well as in line with the general trends of the time, where vulgarization and ""advertisement"" were becoming a larger and larger portion of the ""business"" of ideas. 

This sort of heuristic approach was certainly not exclusive to Mussolini. Other figures of undisputed intellectual influence - the name of Georges Sorel comes to mind - weren't substantially more well lerned. Of course, unlike those others, at a certain point Mussolini's political career begun to take prominence over his other occupations, so that his intellectual aspirations had to adapt and accommodate for the former, becoming at the same time more heuristic and more manufactured. 

Outside of that political career - which is the source of our present interest in Mussolini's intellectual trajectory - he might have been remembered as a mediocre intellectual and proficient publicist, with some following, not much differently from the way Sorel was thought of during his last years. 


There's plenty more which could be said; but I have to be at work in minutes. I'll try to answer any follow up question later today."
711,AskHistorians,"It's the mid-1950s and I'm a reasonably well-informed, newspaper- and news magazine-reading American. How obvious is it that the Guatemala and Iran coups d'état happened with heavy input from United Fruit and Anglo-Iranian Oil, respectively?","I wrote my doctoral dissertation on the Eisenhower administration's policy/policy-making in the Third World (viewed through the lens of Richard Nixon, but that's another issue).

I also have a tendency when answering questions here to write a gross amount of text, so I'm going to focus solely on Guatemala.  One main reason is that the answer here is more clear cut, as the coup to overthrow Mossadeq was a very messy affair (by which I mean far more complex and clunky than the popular image).

The first thing I want to establish is that while United Fruit certainly pushed for the Eisenhower administration to act against Árbenz, the key people were not primarily or even significantly motivated by United Fruit's position.  The same people that authors like Stephen Kinzer (The Brothers, 2013) argue were pushing for the coup so as to benefit United Fruit or ""American business"", namely John Foster and Allen Dulles, actually complained about United Fruit and hoped its power in Latin America could be curtailed.  I.e., John Foster Dulles strongly disliked that there was an ""understanding"" that U.S. administrations acted for the benefit of the Fruit Company in Latin America.  Indeed, even Allen Dulles agreed that the United Fruit Company had caused the administration so many headaches it needed to be made subordinate to Latin American states (so long as those states were friendly), and considered the post-coup plans the CIA had to serve the dual purpose of bringing regional stability and bolstering the cause of weakening the Fruit Company.  Allen Dulles argued that eventually Latin American states would become stable and strong enough that anti-trust suits would become unnecessary as the Fruit Company would have its power smashed by those Latin American states.

I understand it's a rather bold claim I'm making - that the coup to overthrow Árbenz was not primarily done for economic reasons (long-story-short, the coup took place because Eisenhower and Dulles would not allow big C communist footholds in Latin America and through both his own actions and the administration's treatment of him Árbenz was acting more and more like he was or would like to be in league with the U.S.S.R.), but I'll provide sources for that and am willing to argue it more fully if someone with an economic/marxist/revisionist bent wants to dive down that hole.  Keep in mind that I'm not arguing the administration had a sophisticated understanding of Latin American politics (it didn't), nor am I arguing that economics did not play any role (they obviously did).

The basic answer to your question dove-tails with some of my sources.

**Answer:  Yes, a well-informed and well-read American would have likely guessed or concluded the coup occurred due to the influence of United Fruit.**  Many of the notes Richard Nixon took in preparation for his various (sometimes disastrous) missions abroad were based on newspapers.As concerns Latin American affairs, Nixon was in a kind of impossible competition with President Eisenhower's brother, Milton - who was somehow considered an expert on the region seemingly based on the fact that he'd travelled the region and been feted by the upper class - in trying to have more influence and better press coverage for his missions abroad.

Still, Nixon and his staff gathered and analysed press coverage of various events, including the lead up to the overthrow of Árbenz and the aftermath.  While they only had sparse direct access to more local papers (the CIA and State Departments had more, but tended to summarise these in wires to Nixon's staff if requested), what they did have access to showed that Árbenz's overthrow was portrayed in communist or socialist papers as a direct result of American imperialism and for the benefit of United Fruit.  The basic point I'm making is that a well-read and attentive person in 1950s America could likely have connected the dots and concluded Árbenz's overthrow was in some way related to his actions against United Fruit.  What's more, administration officials were aware of this appearance.

At the 202nd meeting of the NSC under Eisenhower, President Eisenhower urged the Attorney General and Justice Department to proceed with a variety of proposed anti-trust suits (some against oil companies in the Middle East), including against the United Fruit Company for its actions in Latin America and Guatemala specifically.  John Foster Dulles also supported the anti-trust suit for the very reason that it would detract from the notion common amongst Latin American nations and others that the ""sole objective of the United States \[sic\] foreign policy was to protect the fruit company.""  To summarise, the Eisenhower administration knew it appeared that United Fruit could basically call in the U.S. government to take care of any problems it encountered in Latin America - this was seen as very bad by the Eisenhower administration for a variety of reasons but namely because the U.S.S.R. could leverage that appearance to create instability and because it led to mistrust between Latin American leaders and American officials.  The key point during this meeting was that Eisenhower and others wanted the anti-trust suit to be brought after the coup, so it did not appear that the administration was removing Árbenz despite him being perfectly correct about United Fruit's abuse of its power.

This probably reads like a mishmash of poorly thought-out policies and often conflicting goals.  That's because it was, and even officials were aware of it **at the time**.  At the 204th meeting of the NSC, Eisenhower's advisers, including Dulles and Nixon, pointed out that the administration regularly failed to provide aid beyond military aid or anti-communist support; which would not address let alone resolve issues in states like Guatemala or Indochina.  However, coups were cheaper than wars, and when you're not considering long-term consequences or simply reacting to the spectre of Communism, they make a lot of sense.

712,AskHistorians,"According to an NBC Article, Presidents from Truman to H.W. Bush have been asked by military commanders to launch nuclear weapons at one point during their Presidencies. What spurred this advice from military commanders and why were they so quick to recommend it, knowing the almost certain outcome?","So I am not sure that Ciricione was saying that _all_ Presidents from Truman to H.W. Bush were advised this. I suspect he was saying that Presidents have been advised this over various points in time — between Truman and H.W. Bush. 

The big point here is that the ""nuclear taboo"" — the non-use of nuclear weapons after WWII — is a norm and not a ""rule."" It took time to get established. It gets challenged regularly. It didn't have to even happen — if Eisenhower had been President during the early Korean War, perhaps they would have been used? There is a lot of contingency there.

And I just want to note that you say ""knowing the almost certain outcome"" — but the outcomes are not as certain as you may think. E.g., there was no mutual assured destruction during the Korea War (none really with the USSR until the early 1960s; you do have a _deterrence_ structure in the 1950s, but it is not mutually assured, and a lot of it is about the Soviets threatening Europe not the USA) or against non-nuclear powers (e.g. Vietnam). Yes, the USA was not going to nuke the USSR after the 1960s but there are lots of other possible places where nukes could have come into play that do not involve straightforward deterrence theory. And there are also many ways to use nukes — they are not just ""big bombs dropped on cities,"" they can also be ""small weapons used tactically"" by the 1950s. That makes them seem less ""special"" to many military and even some political figures (Eisenhower and Nixon were both of the mind that tactical nukes were basically ""non-special"").

Some well-known and well-documented examples:

* Truman and the Berlin Crisis. Advisors recommended to Truman that he launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the USSR. Truman declined, though he did authorize moving non-nuclear assemblies to the region. 

* Truman and the Korean War. Could have used nukes. Some generals wanted to use nukes. Plenty of popular discussion about the use of nukes. Moved non-nuclear assemblies to the region, but opted not to use nukes. By 1949 Truman was very dubious about the utility of nuclear weapons in military conflicts and also very aware of the fact that he required international support to wage a conflict of this nature.

* Eisenhower and the Taiwan Strait crisis. Threatened to use nukes against China. Lots of talk at top levels of possibility of using nukes. Willingness by Eisenhower to potentially use them. Military advisors recommended them. Ultimately didn't need to use them. (This incident, as an aside, led to China starting their own nuclear program.)

* Ex-President Eisenhower recommended to both Kennedy and Johnson that they use nukes in Laos and Vietnam. Lots of people talked about possibility of using them in Vietnam at different levels. Ultimately neither President was interested.

* There was some discussion about possible use of nukes in the Nixon administration but ultimately a much lesser sort of pressure. Nixon himself was interested in nukes in Vietnam, and stated in 1985 that he considered using nukes four times during his administration (Vietnam, the Yom-Kippur War, the Sino-Soviet border disputes, and the 1971 India-Pakistan War... yeah, don't ask me what he intended to do with them, this is just what he told Time magazine). Much of the Nixon admin papers remains closed so it is hard to know more. What is interesting about Nixon is that he seems to have been the one interested in nukes, whilst his military people had internalized the idea that they were not actually all that useful.

* I don't know of strong pressures from the top on Ford, Carter, or Reagan to use nukes in any of their conflicts. I suspect there were no truly serious ones. By this point the Soviets have true MAD capability, and the Chinese have the capability to do real damage (though not MAD), so any possible use would have to be in smaller conflicts. This does not mean that the world was not ever _close_ to using weapons — we are speaking only on whether presidents were encouraged to use them by top advisors. The ""taboo"" was thoroughly in place at this point — if you were going to use nukes, you'd have to argue why nukes would be more useful in a given situation when they didn't appear to have been useful in previous ones. Again, this does not mean these were anti-nuclear presidents. Reagan did much to accelerate and encourage the nuclear arms race. But he didn't really contemplate striking first. (The Soviets were not always sure of that, though!)

* Lastly, G.H.W. Bush — during the first Gulf War there was explicit talk about the possibility of using them in Iraq. Basically it was implied that if Saddam Hussein set the Kuwaiti oil fields on fire, or used chemical or biological weapons against US troops, we might use nukes in retaliation (in a low-yield, tactical way — not targeting cities). In fact, we now know that Saddam _thought_ we would use nukes if they set the oil fields on fire... and set them on fire anyway. (Which is an interesting example of nuclear deterrence _not_ working, in a sense.) But the reality of these pressures seems to have not been extreme; Bush was not interested in using tactical nukes. 

* Though we are well beyond our remit in terms of the 20-year rule, it might be worth noting that there was much talk of using low-yield ""bunker-busting"" nukes in the GWB administration, and considerable funds applied to the question. Anecdotally I have heard military sorts of people talk about the advantages such a weapon would have in targeting underground facilities like Fordow. Presumably these discussions also took place at higher levels. Cheney, at least in public statements, said they were not interested in using nuclear weapons in such cases.

Anyway — the authoritative source on this topic is Nina Tannewald, _The Nuclear Taboo: The United States and the Non-Use of Nuclear Weapons Since 1945_ (Cambridge University Press, 2007). It discusses all of the above examples mentioned, and several others. "
713,AskHistorians,Why does New Jersey have no big cities? How'd it become so fragmented?,"To start, New Jersey isn’t exactly “fragmented” - it is, as you stated, [the most densely populated state in the union,](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2010/dec/density-data-text.html) and forms an integral part of two of the nation’s largest metropolitan areas, New York City and Philadelphia. City limits in the U.S. are often a poor way to judge size, anyways, considering that Mesa, Arizona [is larger than ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population)Miami, Atlanta, or Kansas City. Once you consider metropolitan areas, New Jersey seems a lot more prominent - [just within the top ten,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_statistical_areas) Newark, Jersey City, and Camden all appear as integral parts of some of the country’s largest metro areas. So really, city limits are a poor way to judge a city’s size, and in general it’s probably more accurate to look at MSAs or CSAs, combined statistical areas.

Historically, New Jersey was one of the first states to industrialize, and Newark, in particular, prospered tremendously from the growth of industry in the state. By 1930, its population had grown to over 440,000, making it the [18th largest city in the country](https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab16.txt), arguably a “traditional big city”. From that point forward, however, its population consistently declined until the 2010 census. So what happened? A combination of factors, the most obvious being deindustrialization and suburbanization, as Newark’s white population fled the inner city to more distant suburbs. [Here is an excellent series of maps that show this process in action.](https://www.nj.com/news/2017/07/how_newark_has_changed_since_1960.html) Of course, this was happening across the nation, but Newark’s heavily industrial economy made it even more susceptible to decline, and high racial tensions “accelerated \[changes in ethnic composition\] after the city was wracked by rioting in 1967.” ([https://www.britannica.com/place/Newark-New-Jersey](https://www.britannica.com/place/Newark-New-Jersey)) A similar shift happened in the Philadelphia suburb of Camden, [as it shifted from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey#Demographics) a predominantly white, industrial city to an impoverished, minority-majority community. There’s plenty of existing literature on practices such as redlining which disadvantaged minority residents and led to poor, minority-majority urban centers, and I won’t spend time outlining it all here, but it was far from a New Jersey-specific phenomenon - however, as a heavily industrial state, deindustrialization hit New Jersey harder than most, and so the urban decline was greater than most.

Aside from that - and this is just a hypothesis which someone more versed in the subject can affirm or refute - I’d imagine New Jersey’s status as a state that is in some ways essentially a New York/Philadelphia suburb has contributed to its relatively “fragmented” population, since the wealth and population is going to concentrate just across the state border, while smaller supporting communities spring up across the Hudson and the Delaware, respectively. Suburbs are rarely “huge cities” population-wise without space to sprawl, which New Jersey lacks, and even in those cases they rarely surpass or equal their “central city” in the public imagination. (The only that comes to mind are places like Fort Worth or Oakland, and even those are still rarely held to the same level as Dallas or San Francisco.) I mentioned Mesa earlier, because despite being the 35th largest city in the nation, it’s not the type of city that would come to mind as a “big city”, because it’s just a Phoenix suburb. City limits are misleading."
714,AskHistorians,How big were Asses in ancient Rome?,"You're looking for the as (plural asses), not the ass. The as was the Roman copper coin and their equivalent to the penny as the lowest form of currency. By changing the as-denarius ratio the Romans just were saying you needed to trade in 16 asses per denarius, not 12."
715,AskHistorians,"I am a 30 year old Incan running messenger. After years of service, my knees just can't take the abuse anymore. What are my options?","If you’re a chaski runner, odds are you know your way around the route you’ve been running - it’s quite likely you’ve been conscripted for your duties from the local area. Your *tambo* way station may be a few miles from home, but it’s likely not too far. You only need to pass whatever *qhipu* messages - or perhaps fresh fish for the Sapa Inca, maybe he asked for some for dinner! - from your tambo to the next one. Then you’ll pass it on relay-race style. You may be one of only a few people around with ready access to the royal road (Qhapaq Ñan) that isn’t military - the road is for imperial business alone.

As for what would happen to a middle-aged chaski, well, it’s likely there’s some land you can be working on - either your own, or otherwise you may be asked to fulfill your *mita* labor service to the empire by working on the royal estates or performing local maintenance on those way stations and roads I just mentioned. Food and security will be covered by the Inca from storehouses you pay into, and they’ll very possibly be quite sensitive to the needs of the household and community. Which is to say, if you’re the only male head of household the Inca will find other ways to get their mita, or else they’ll only conscript you when your fields don’t need a lot of attention. Planting and harvesting are both moments of “all hands on deck” for a village. Hopefully your community was...amicably brought into the Tawantinsuyu. But of course, if you were sufficiently recalcitrant, there’s a good chance you’d never see your family or friends again, having been completely atomized and sent to far corners of the empire to act as migrant workers on royal estates.

Now, as you get very old, you may end up taking on a job traditionally reserved for women - weaving. Hard for you to pass the chaqitaqlla (digging plow) into the ground, but you can drop spindle some thread for your wife or niece, and maybe even get passable at working the loom. Of course, there’s likely all manner of political negotiation and labor distribution you could while away your time with, too.

EDIT for sources: Okay, now that I'm awake, caffeinated, and questions have been answered, here's a couple good sources on Inca infrastructure:

John Hyslop's 1984 *The Inca Road System* from Academic Press of New York, and his follow-up in 1990 *Inka Settlement Planning* from University of Texas Press, are both excellent resources. Hyslop followed many of the old roads (traveling on a motorcycle, natch) and investigated/reviewed the chronicles to confirm.

John Rowe, in 1946 wrote for Julian Steward's *Handbook of South American Indians* with a chapter of about 150 pages called ""Inca Culture at the Time of the Spanish Conquest"". It is a classic, and still quite insightful for those curious about the ins and outs of Inca practices.

In another comment below, I mentioned a few good baseline resources to tackle Andean studies in general, and the Incas in particular. There's plenty more if you have particular questions!

Today the Qhapaq Ñan is UNESCO world heritage, stretching across six countries (Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and a tiny tip in Colombia) - there are more reports and information out there too. Happy to vet any sources that crop up in your own search for more information!"
716,AskHistorians,Why did the USA's founding fathers feel the Post Office was so important it needed to be in the constitution?,"This answer to some extent overlaps the nice answer already provided (while I was writing this one), but there's a few additional details here, so I thought I'd provide it anyway.

There are two important pieces of context necessary to understand how the power to ""establish Post Offices and Post Roads"" (called the ""Postal Clause"") landed in the Constitution.

The first thing to understand is that the Articles of Confederation (the interstate compact that preceded the United States Constitution) provided the federal Congress with the power to establish and regulate Post Offices.  So one immediate reason that the Constitution provided a Postal power to the federal Government was that it was already a power being exercised by the federal government going into the Constitutional Convention.  At least some of the founders were not pleased with Postal administration under the Articles, however.  For example, in a letter from John Jay to George Washington in 1789, Jay notes: 

>The Direction of the Post Office, instead of being as hitherto, consigned chiefly to a committee, and managed without much System, should I think be regulated by Law, and put under the Superintendence, and in some Degree under the controul of the Executive. The Public are not well satisfied on this Head, as Matters now stand, and there is but little Reason to expect any important change during the Existence of the present Government. The succeeding one will have an opportunity of doing a very acceptable Service to their Constituents by regulating the Post office in a proper Manner; and the more of such things they may have to do, the better. 

The Articles of Confederation provided only a power relating to Post Offices, but, during the Constitutional Convention, the founders discussed adding several additional related powers to the Constitution, such as adding a power to establish ""post roads,"" a power to ""cut canals"" (proposed by Benjamin Franklin), or a power to ""to grant charters of incorporation where the interest of the U.S. might require the legislative provisions of individual States may be incompetent"" (proposed by James Madison).  Of the debated powers, the only additional power that was actually incorporated into the Constitution, however, was the power to establish ""Post Roads."" More significant changes to the postal organization would have to await the First Congress's enactment of the Act of September 22, 1789 and the Postal Service Act of 1792.  But that's only a very narrow answer to your question.

The second and broader answer is that the founders conceived of the federal government as a government of limited powers.  This scheme is made explicit by the 10th amendment which provides that ""[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.""  That is to say, the United States Congress (and the federal government more generally) only has the powers given to it by the Constitution, and no others.  The Constitution contains an extensive list of so-called ""enumerated powers"" for the Congress, which includes the power to establish Post Offices and Post Roads, but also includes, for example, a power to ""regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes"", and to ""coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures.""  You may see a theme here, which is that many of the powers the Constitution provides to Congress relate to areas which necessarily affect the interest of the States collectively and that may not be adequately addressed by states acting individually.

So the ability of the Congress to establish Post Offices and Post Roads can be understood as another way in which the founders sought to provide the nascent federal government with a clearly enumerated ability to regulate and address areas that affected the interests of multiple states, which the delivery of mail unquestionably does.  For example, in the Records of the Federal Convention, during a discussion of whether to add additional powers to the clause, James Madison noted that the primary object of the clause, in his view, was to ""secure an easy communication between the States.""  In short, because the mail, by its nature, must travel between the states, the founders viewed it as a function better regulated by the federal government.

717,AskHistorians,"Coca-cola largely removed the cocaine from its formula in 1903, more than a decade before it was made illegal- why did they do it? Were there negative associations with cocaine at the time? How did its removal affect the drink's popularity?","One good source on this would be [Citizen Coke: THE MAKING OF COCA-COLA CAPITALISM](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Citizen-Coke/) by Bartow Elmore (Ohio State). I don't have my copy handy here at home, but the [dissertation on which it is based](https://libra2.lib.virginia.edu/downloads/7w62f853v?filename=X030865291.pdf) is available online. Both have a full chapter on Coke's use and sourcing of coca extracts (ch. 3 in the dissertation) that note "" Originally the Coca-Cola formula called for coca leaf extract containing roughly 3/2001h of a grain of cocaine per serving, but company president Asa Candler decided to eliminate the miniscule narcotic content by 1903 **in the face of growing consumer fears about the adverse health effects of cocaine addiction**."" (emphasis mine, p.131). Concerned about taste, however, the company replaced this with ""decocainized coca leaves"" and kola nut extract, which was internally called ""Merchandise #5."" The sourcing of this material-- really a waste product of the cocaine processing industry --is the focus of the book chapter, following the author's pattern of one chapter for each of the major ingredients (water, sugar, caffiene, etc.)

Later in the book Bartow notes that there was no real reason to keep the coca byproduct (deconainized leaves) in the formula except to maintain the ""secret formula"" recipe, stating that ""there seemed to be no real material use for the coca extract other than to protect the company's brand image."" They just wanted to keep the word ""coca"" in the product name. He draws heavily on Paul Gootenberg's  [Andean Cocaine: The Making of a Global Drug](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/115/4/1200/34416) for the context of this chapter. One interesting factor is that Coke did not own plantations in Peru or processing plants, so was buying on the wholesale market. By the 1880s there was so much global demand for coca that the security and price of that supply came into question, so by removing coca from the product (except for the near-valueless ""decocainized"" leaves) the soft drink company was lowering its costs and severing its ties to the licit coca market.

In an article that summarizes the arguments of his book, Bartow writes about FBN (Federal Bureau of Narcotics) files which ""...reveal how Coke worked with the FBN to secure exclusive access to legal coca imports into the United States after 1914 when the federal government criminalized coca trafficking. The FBN approved special exemptions in federal counternarcotics legislation allowing Coca-Cola to contract with the Stepan Chemical Company in Maywood, New Jersey, to purchase decocainized coca leaf extract, or coca leaf fluid leftover after cocaine processing. The FBN, however, aggressively denied other applicants seeking legal coca imports into the United States, including many rival soft drink companies. By restricting buyer access to coca leaves, the federal government helped to create a monopsony for Coca-Cola, thereby keeping prices for this exotic ingredient down. "" See  Bartow J. Elmore. ""Citizen Coke: An Environmental and Political History of the Coca-Cola Company."" *Enterprise & Society* 14, no. 4 (2013): 717-731. [https://muse.jhu.edu/](https://muse.jhu.edu/).

As for the response among consumers, I'd suggest looking at *For God, Country, and Coca-Cola* by Mark Pendergrast. I don't have a copy at hand but recall it covers the formula, consumer demand, and the rise of Coca-Cola in this period in great detail.

718,AskHistorians,What was sex like when most people lived in 1 room/1 bedroom homes?,"I've answered this before under my old handle:

They just had sex. Couples would have sex with their children or relatives in the bed, there wasn't the sense of taboo or privacy around it that we have today.

I'm also going to choose to interpret this as ""when did sex become private in Western Europe"" and I will draw on a [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2ebapq/when_how_and_why_did_the_view_on_nudity_and/cjxz33y) and a blog entry I just [published on the topic, here.](http://www.annalspornographie.com/?p=133) and from my book Annals Of Pornographie: How Porn Became Bad 



The term you are looking for is called ""the invention of privacy.""

The works and research in this field is somewhat obscure and highly complicated. The most important book, *La Vie du privee--The History of Private Life*--is nearly four volumes long. The other major (recent) work by McKeon is about 1000 pages and very difficult to read as a layman (or even as an expert...) and is called *The Secret History of Domesticity*

Prior to the sixteenth century in most of Europe, and well into the seventeenth century, there was no particular reaction, positive or negative about semipublic sex, nudity or sexual organs. These things were common, from what we know of surviving records in London, Paris, Florence, Venice, Milan, and other city records. For example, there were Cock and Hen bars in London, which would be equivalent to a singles bar today. In these clubs, what we would call nonpenatrative sex was on more or less public display, and indeed, it was common to see it in the streets as well. 

Part of the reason for that is because there was no police force to enforce public decorum as we have today. And even if they were, they would not necessarily have had the authority to do anything about public lewdness, drunkenness, or other misbehavior as we would see it. In fact, it took nearly a half-century after the establishment of the Metropolitan Police in London for them to feel as if they had sufficient authority to punish morality offenders (see the numerous King and Queen declarations on this, esp. Victoria's relation with the Police).

The larger part of it, however, had to do with 'the invention of privacy.' What I mean by that is that in the late middle ages and early renaissance, it was quite common for households to be one room, and in particular, to have one shared bed for the entire family. This meant that children would be in bed and in all probability witness or be aware of their parents making their siblings. Here's Ian Moulton:

>[Over the course of the seventeenth century] Bedchambers-and the beds themselves-slowly shifted from being common living areas (in lower-class homes) or sites for social gatherings (in upper-class ones) to being what they are today-private space for the single person or couple who sleep in them. Reading became dominantly private and silent rather than spoken and communal.

The shift happened because of two major reasons. The first is that building material became much cheaper and architectural knowledge became much more common, allowing the creation of multiple rooms, better heating, and what is termed 'the creation of the upstairs.'

The second reason is a little more complicated, and stems, essentially, from the Protestant Revolution touched off by Martin Luther.

Between 1100-1300 the Catholic Church tried to discourage concubinage and loose moral standards among the upper and lower classes, with greater or lesser success. In fact, it became one of their central concerns: surviving records of English Church courts indicate that sexual and marital cases made up for between 60-90% of all litigation. Although this was successful in many places, one of the places it was notably *unsuccessful* was in Rome, the capital of the Church and the center of the Christian world. This is something that was frequently satirized and mocked by humanist reformers such as Boccaccio and, of course, Aretino.

As Dabhoiwala notes in his Origins of Sex:

>Sex was central to the Reformation’s reshaping of the world. To Protestant eyes the Catholic church’s whole attitude to sexual morality seemed pathetically lax and dishonest. Its priests were lecherous parasites: the ideal of clerical celibacy was no more than a joke. [Church] courts were not nearly fierce enough in pursing sexual offender and punishing their moral sins… Particularly scandalous was the toleration [and regulation] of prostitution. 

Indeed, Dabhoiwala continues: “[Luther and other] protestants advanced a purer, more rigorous morality. The Catholic aspiration to celibacy was jettisoned as unrealistic and counter-productive… On the other hands, God’s many pronouncements against whoredom were to be taken even more seriously: all sex outside marriage should be severely punished.”

So, the general public did not really care one way or another about public display of private organs or sex. The Church did, but was not able to control the laity, thus helping Luther in his crusade and helping to create a sense of privacy in protestant culture. Look to my quotes from McKeon [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2ebapq/when_how_and_why_did_the_view_on_nudity_and/cjxz33y) to understand more on that topic.


That covers the Protestants, but what about the Catholic reaction and Counter Reformation?

Envoys at the Council of Trent pointed out that some of Luther’s critiques were correct: “citing information garnered from an extensive visition of Bavaria in 1558, [an envoy] painted a dark picture. The vast majority of the parish clergy was ignorant and infected with heresy. Out of a hundred only three or four were not secretly married or keeping concubines, to the great scandal of the faithful.” Furthermore, it was common for upper-class men to clandestinely marry or promise marriage to women of lower station to ‘get into their pants,’ and then, if she got pregnant, to deny ever having been married. 

The result was the *Tamesti* which stated that “whereas clandestine  marriages had previously declared valid, though blameworthy, all would be deemed invalid unless celebrated before a priest and at least two witnesses.” In O’Malley’s view “No single provision of the entire council affected the Catholic laity more directly than Tamesti… The approval and implementation of Tamesti meant that in the future the church recognized no marriages between Catholics as valid unless it had been witnessed by a priest.” The intention and effects of Tamesti were, in a way, feminist in the sense that they sought to protect and enfranchise women against being abandoned due to clandestine marriages. 

This debate, probably more than anything else, has had a profound impact and influence on our lives today. For example, in modern times we often consider anything that has to do with sex or sexuality as ‘private’ and something that should occur ‘behind closed doors.’ In the sixteenth, seventeenth, and even the early eighteenth centuries this was not necessarily the case (though it became increasingly so as time progressed). 

In fact it was not it uncommon for sexual acts to take place in a bar or in public, and witnesses would think very little of it.

Again, this was a period where entire families would share the same bed and children were likely to know just how their parents made new siblings. The splitting of the private and public world that happened as a result of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation had an impact on the architecture of the home and the attitudes around sex. Occurring first among the upper classes, who were likely already accustomed to formalized and public marriages. They then began to be adopted by middle and lower classes, slowly at first and then with increasing rapidity until public and private life came to be a cultural standard.

Of course, this is not to say that no one hid intercourse or tried to achieve privacy before this time period, but it was much different in cultural context.

**Edit:** do see below for /u/sunagainstgold 's discussion of pre -16th century European ideas. My discussion, and my research, is largely limited to Reformation and post-reformation Europe. Invention of privacy is my term, not someone else's, I use it to talk about the formalization and creation of the concepts of ""privacy"" and rights to/demands of it starting in the 16th century and carrying to the present day. And as I've noted in the last sentence, there were attempts to seek out private spaces, but these private spaces were not *privacy* as we would understand it.

719,AskHistorians,"Marco Polo is quoted to have said on his deathbed, ""I did not tell half of what I saw, for I knew I would not be believed."" What things may he not have described to the public and why?","Jacopo da Acqui's report of Marco Polo's last testament should be put in its proper context. His family members were trying to get him to repent and disown all the lies he'd written, to which Polo sneered that he had not told even *half* of what he'd seen.

Assuming the anecdote is true (or even if it's an invention by Jacopo, defending his subject, which seems just as likely), there are two ways to take it. First, if Polo told the other half, it would be realistic enough to make the whole story seem plausible. Second, the stories in the other half were *even wilder*.

Fortunately, we have ways to investigate both possibilities. Boring one first.

**Scribes Gonna Scribe**

The manuscript tradition of the Travels is a mess. It's maybe not as bad as Piers Plowman, but it's a mess. We don't have the original. There's no single surviving manuscript from which all others derive. Which is to say, there is at least something missing from/added to every existing version.

Some changes are surely accidental, or the result of translation problems. Others, though, are substantial omissions/additions. In those cases, it seems likely that somewhere along the way, a scribe/translator either thought the text needed that story, or saw that story and thought it did not belong for whatever reason.

One good example is the large void in the overall narrative, which occurs when Polo is basically hanging out in the East. Some manuscripts don't really say anything. Others explain that he was specially chosen as governor of a city for three years. Oh, and that he, his father, and his uncle pretty much single-handedly won a siege for the Khan by reinventing the trebuchet.

A passage like this one, especially since it was almost certainly added to some rather than omitted from the rest, suggests a couple of possibilities for reconciling skepticism/maintaining the book's veneer of ""plausibility,"" fully aware it was just a veneer and part of the genre.

First, it fills in a large temporal gap at least in part. Useful in and of itself. Second, it casts the Europeans in a *really* good light. It's usually thought that even when pointing out good qualities of non-Christians, medieval European travel narratives relate tales and descriptions in ways that emphasize their Otherness. Massaging the awesomeness of the Polos serves those ends quite well--especially useful in a post-fall of Acre world.

A lot of additions seem to point to scribes feeling that the version they had in front of them was just missing a few details. Like a description for how horse thieves or bar brawlers were punished will have the procedure for punishing murderers added to it in later recensions. If the scribes thought the story needed it, Polo's friends and family could well have thought the same.

But really what you're here for is shipwrecks and cannibals, right?

**Diamond Poop, or, 1001 Mediterranean Nights**

In [this earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5570ic/in_one_story_of_sindbad_the_sailor_and_in_marco/d88riob/), I discuss how one episode that Marco Polo recounts traces back in time to amazing 12th century Persian poet Nizami, to a 10th century natural history text in Arabic, to a 4th century Christian bishop, to...Herodotus. From Polo:

> Among these mountains there are certain great and deep valleys, to the bottom of which there is no access. Wherefore the men who go in search of the diamonds take with them pieces of flesh, as lean as they can get, and these they cast into the bottom of a valley...When the eagles [who also eat the deadliest snakes known to the ENTIRE WORLD] see the meat thrown down they pounce upon it and carry it up to some rocky hill-top...

> The people go to the nests of those white eagles, of which there are many, and in their droppings they find plenty of diamonds which the birds have swallowed in devouring the meat that was cast into the valleys.

The details of the story change (Polo's diamonds are Herodotus's cinnamon sticks), but the underlying ""plot"" is the same.

This matters for present purposes because it shows how stories like this one are circulating around the Mediterranean-Asian world, crossing geographic and linguistic barriers as though they didn't exist. Ibn Battuta, Marco Polo, any interested traveler might well have heard the same basic story, with different details (snakes? no snakes? Alexander the Great? Random peasants?) from multiple sources. Heck, the valley of the diamonds story will even eventually be recorded in *1001 Nights* (the messiest manuscript tradition yet), although the MS is more recent than Polo but the story was probably part of the collection beforehand.

The Mediterranean-Asian world was a world of stories. So in addition to whatever Polo did/did not see with his *eyes* firsthand, there's what he ""saw"" in the sense of having heard or overheard. And thus, the question becomes: what stories or what kinds of stories might we expect, that Polo nevertheless leaves out?

Looking at a 10th century Arabic text known as the *Marvels of India*, I'm going to suggest that what he left out includes shipwrecks and cannibals.

*Marvels of India*, like Polo and Ibn Battuta, is a collection of anecdotes, although it doesn't really attempt to be a cohesive travel narrative of any sort. The reason I think it's particularly useful for present purposes is that taken as a whole, the book is *really, really repetitive.* How many stories do you need that emphasize THIS FISH IS REALLY BIG?  (At least four in a row, at one point, to say nothing of elsewhere in the text). It's a mishmash of tales, of the ""1001 Mediterranean Nights,"" just like Marco Polo. (And yes, it includes the 'valley of the diamonds' legend.)

And some of the most common themes suicide, monkeys, snakes, REALLY BIG FISH...shipwrecks and cannibals.

Mind you, cannibals and shipwrecks both appear in Marco Polo's books. But not like this. The cannibals of *Marvels* sometimes have tails. Sometimes the book's author goes into *way* too much detail about how the cannibals cook their meals. And over and over, we read the trope--that survives to day--of the shipwrecked sailors on the island of the cannibal king.

In a world of travelers, merchants, and educated people across cultures (or the product of one author with a really thorough education), Marco Polo would have heard a lot of stories from a lot of people. One way or another, some of them wound up in his *Travels.* And one way or another, Jacopo da Acqui had his character Polo defend the ""truth"" in his own voice--whether that truth was what Polo saw--or what he had heard from someone who had heard it from someone."

It was not a black flag with a red dragon on it, as depicted in *Outlaw King*, but rather was shaped like the [Roman draco](http://www.fectio.org.uk/articles/draco5.jpg), a sort of windsock with an openmouthed metal head with red fabric attached to it. When turned towards the wind, the fabric would inflate and writhe. I have also found no evidence of those accompanying the banner wearing the same dragon on their tabards, as the Prince of Wales and some of his knights do in the film.

The banner was first used by the Anglo-Saxon kings simply as a royal standard. In 752 it was used by the king of Wessex in a battle against the Mercians, in 1016 against Cnut, and in 1066 at Hastings, [as seen on the Bayeux Tapestry](https://images.theconversation.com/files/140459/original/image-20161005-14227-1e7ovyz.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C11%2C1491%2C997&q=45&auto=format&w=496&fit=clip). It was only after the Conquest that it seems to have had a wider significance relating to the conduct of war. From Richard I (the first English king to revive the tradition) onwards, the banner appears to have been used exclusively against those considered to be rebels or infidels, associating it with *guerre mortelle* or Roman war, war without limits where no mercy had to be shown to enemies. The only legitimate targets of such war, according to medieval theorists, were rebels and infidels (though some, like Thomas Aquinas, considered rebels to be exempt from this). The banner was used by Richard I in 1191 against Saladin at Arsuf, Henry III in 1245 and 1257 against the Welsh (who he referred to as rebels), 1264 against the barons, Edward I against the Scots (who he claimed sovereignty over), and Edward III at against the French in 1346 (whose throne he claimed).

Though some historians have been dubious that the dragon banner declared mortal war, several of medieval chroniclers certainly saw it as such. John of Oxnead (d. after 1293) described it as 'a sign of death and great retribution', Matthew Paris (d. c. 1259) said that its use by Henry III in 1257 'threatened the total extermination of Wales', and William Rishanger (d. after 1312) said it was 'a royal banner that portends a sentence of death'. The confusion may arise because the kings often intended it more as a threat than a promise. Edward III only raised the banner at Crecy after the French first unfurled the Oriflamme (which had similar connections with signifying no quarter would be given). Henry III's 1245 campaign ended with a treaty and the 1257 expedition was delayed.

I wrote a [short piece about this for a Scottish newspaper just last week](https://www.thenational.scot/news/17262475.raising-the-dragon-outlaw-king-accuracy-under-the-microscope/), which has a bit more detail on the dragon's various appearances in the record.

721,AskHistorians,"For a country that had a huge Empire and access to all kinds of seasonings and spices, why is traditional British food so bland?","If one looks back to older recipes such as those presented in *The English Huswife* by G. Markham through to *The Scots Kitchen,* by F. McNeill we see a breadth of ingredients and cuisines available in our history. Additionally, British baking history is brimming with historical recipes. Plum cakes spring to mind, but a great many of our most celebrated bakes are quite old indeed.

So, what happened? The short answer is rationing. The system introduced in WWII by Lord Woolton did away with a large amount of spices, sugar, and other non-essential ""luxuries."" As biographied in *Eggs or Anarchy* by W. Sitwell, Lord Woolton had a delicate digestion that reacted poorly to rich or spiced foods. In addition to his own views, the wider strategic view that anything not strictly essential to sustenance was an unnecessary waste of shipping capacity meant that these spices disappeared quite suddenly.

Of course, the British people had to adapt to this new system. The government attempted to aid this by providing example recipes within the Rationing system. The Ministry of Food released many leaflets over the years of the war, which you can read in a collected format in *Food Facts for the Kitchen Front.* This, sadly, is where it all goes downhill. The famous examples of ""Mock Duck"" and other less favoured British foods are present. The instructions often told cooks to overboil food, and seasoning was limited in the directions. Spices were almost non-existent.

Now, I feel I have to note some successes here. Carrot Cake was born from these leaflets, as an attempt to make sweet cake with little or no sugar, using an easily grown native vegetable. Apple Crumble also made its debut in this era, as a simple dish that required less resources than a full Apple Cake. Since foraging and growing your own fruit was permissible, it was an option for many to collect apples for this dish, making it quite inexpensive.

Despite these few successes, a diet of unspiced, overboiled, minimally seasoned food using a limited selection of ingredients had been forced, unilaterally, upon a populace. Even fine dining establishments and upper class households were beholden to it. Lord Woolton intended for the system to appear truly equal and fair to all. Even the King and Queen famously greeted Eleanor Roosevelt with slices of National Loaf for afternoon tea. *The West End Front* by M. Sweet is quite a good book for looking at attempts by high end hotels and restaurants to continue to offer exciting meals to their clientele.

Since the Rationing was so all encompassing, and lasted from 1939 until 1955, it left a culinary mark on a generation. That persisted through the late 20th Century as ingredients, techniques and recipes gradually returned or were introduced."
722,AskHistorians,"How did ""Aryan"" come to mean blonde haired blue eyed white supremacists when the Aryan people were part of the ancient Vedic culture, who by geography would not have been white or blonde?","I would preface of course first to say that trying to find logic in racial pseudoscience is often an exercise in futility. Thinkers almost always contradict in some way as they each are, in the end, creating their own proofs for an untruth, and even single theories often have obvious points of contradiction and inconsistency. But in any case, that dispensed with, the term ""Aryan"" as we think of it in the strains of racial pseudoscience where it is most commonly associated with Nazism is most significantly a result of the writings of Arthur de Gobineau, a Frenchman with pretensions of aristocracy (self-styled as Comte de Gobineau) writing in the mid-1800s, and best known for our purposes for this work *Essai sur l’Inégalité des Races Humaines*. 

Gobineau wasn't doing anything particularly new in his approach to writing on ideas of race and his work reflected common ideas of a noble Germanic race which was superior to all, terms the ""Nordic"" myth, and which traces back at least another century to the writings of another Frenchman, Henri de Boulainvilliers, and which subdivided the people of France into the Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean types, placing the Nordics at the top, and exemplifying them as, put succinctly, the ""descendants of ancient Germanic tribes, the originators of all civilization, and the only peoples capable of leadership"".

Gobineau took this and expanded on it, but writing in the 1850s, added onto it new ideas which had entered into the intellectual milieu of the time, and one of these was the use of the term ""Aryan"", which although first applied in India, was a linguistic term created by a British official to describe the ur-language shared by a vast swathe of the globe, what we would now term Indo-European. The idea of Aryanness language was promoted by several figures before Gobineau, but he made it essentially his own with the way he melded it to racial thinking. The logic of course was quite simple, if the Nordics were the originators of all civilization, and Aryan language the roots of all language, presumably the Aryans and the Nordics were the same thing. But of course he doesn't stop there either, adding in ideas about purity of the blood and corruption caused by mixing of the races. 

Whites were the superior race, Aryans the best of the whites, and mixing with the inferior races - ""White"", ""Yellow"", ""Black"", which he based on the three sons of Noah -  risked the very existence of civilization itself. The purer the Aryan blood, the better the civilization, the weaker, the worse. Aryans had propagated far and wide - settling Europe, Iran, and India -  hence why traces were found even in the latter, but even in Europe, where the Germanics represented the purest specimen remaining, they faced great dangers of decline which Gobineau already believed to be well advanced and needed to be arrested quickly. Gobineau was hardly ignorant of the place of India in all of this, and in fact based much of his work on readings of the *Rig Veda* which he believed supported the story of Genesis. Figueria summarizes other Sanskrit literature he drew on thusly, using them as evidence for the eventual degradation of the Aryans in india due to dilution from long intermingling with the ""aborigines"":

>The *Mahabharata* bore witness to the manner in which Indian society had been invaded by foreign elements.9 Savage vices, absent from the *Ramayana*, appear full-blown in the history of the Pandavas, who had been raised to divine status in order to veil the blood sins of their mothers. In other words, Gobineau read the epics as chronicles of non-Aryan promiscuity and Aryan battles to avoid the dilution of their bloodlines.

This he held up as a warning for what Germany was going through, and the threat to Aryan purity of the Germanics, which they needed to work to stop.

Later thinkers built off this further. Ernst Haeckel's *The Riddle of the Universe: At the Close of the Nineteenth Century* would prove to be an especially influential one in his specific focus on tying in the Aryan Myth with Germanic nationalism and ideas of *Volk*, and the preeminence of the blonde, blue-eyed ideal, which of course are so closely entwined with the popular image of Nazi ideas which would come later. 

But perhaps none is a more important bridge between Gobineau and the Nazis than Houston Stewart Chamberlain, who wrote *Foundations of the Nineteenth Century*. An Englishman by birth, he was fascinated by *Germanness*, marrying Wagner's daughter, and writing German propaganda through the First World War. *Foundations* pushed the Aryan Myth heavily, and was a work admired by Hitler himself, and of many things, is known for being a key part of the attempt to demonstrate that Jesus was, in fact, not Jewish but of Aryan persuasion, which of course ties into the virulent anti-Semitism pushed by all of the writers mentioned here, Chamberlain being a key part in developing Hitler's belief that the Jews needed to be entirely removed from German society.

It also of course it worth mentioning the American Madison Grant who wrote *The Passing of the Great Race: or The Racial Basis of European History* which likewise played in important part in the propagation of the Aryan Myth, and played a key role in the creation of the eugenics movement in early 20th c. America.

But in any case, that is the rough summary of it all. ""*Aryan*"" was a term latched onto by 19th century thinkers for their writings on racial pseudoscience as it fit well with their ideas of a master race, a ruling class, which had once been spread far and wide. Gobineau, as did others, used esoteric and wildly ahistorical readings of texts and evidence to support this view, explain away incongruities, and place their Germanic ideal in the place of this master race in their way of thinking. Although India was a key part of the origin of the term ""Aryan"", these racial thinkers were careful to explain why India itself, of course, was not the exemper of the Aryan race, and instead held it up as an example of how far the white race could fall.

723,AskHistorians,"Where did the ""floor is hot lava"" game come from? I remember playing this game when I was a kid back in the 60s. How long has the floor been hot lava?","So the answer to this seems to be fairly unsatisfying, which is to say likely ""We don't know"". The combined efforts of several mods were unable to turn up more than a single academic treatment of the specific topic, a paper published this year by Tim Hwang (There are a LOT of papers about lava and the sea floor, though!). The broader concept of the game, that certain areas of the floor or ground are ""No-Go Zones"", can be found across numerous cultures and folk traditions and Hwang mentions several in passing, placing the ""Floor is Lava"" game into the same larger category as the familiar game of Hopscotch, which his own source traces back at least as far as the Roman Empire. 
Hwang also goes beyond only European games though, mentioning also a Kenyan game called *mtezo*, which is described by Wanderi as a 'ground avoidance game' utilizing ropes ties to trees or lianas to swing about and not touch the forest floor.

But of course, this doesn't tell us when the floor became *lava*, just that children have probably been avoiding the floor as long as they have been playing games. That particular permutation *seems* to be a development of the mid-20th century. The earliest mention Hwang has of avoiding the floor or else you'll get *burned*, comes from a Roald Dahl short story entitled ""The Wish"", although if we want to split hairs, the floor there is hot coals, not molten lava:

>A tremendous carpet. Bigger than the tennis lawn. Much bigger than that. He regarded it gravely, setting his eyes upon it with mild pleasure. He had never really noticed it before, but now, all of a sudden the colours seemed to brighten mysteriously and spring out at him in a most dazzling way. You see, he told himself, I know how it is. The red parts of the carpet are red-hot lumps of coal. What I must do is this: I must walk all the way along it to the front door without touching them. If I touch the red I will be burnt. As a matter of fact, I will be burnt up completely. And the black parts of the carpet... yes, the black parts are snakes, poisonous snakes, adders mostly, and cobras, thick like tree-trunks round the middle, and if I touch one of them, I'll be bitten and I'll die before tea time. And if I get across safely, without being burnt and without being bitten, I will be given a puppy for my birthday tomorrow

The story progresses with the protagonist's journey over the carpet, experiencing this small fantasy world that he created. In the end though it is the snakes that get him, not the coals, ""*this bare hand of his going right into the middle of a great glistening mass of black and he gave one piercing cry as it touched.*""

It is of course possible that earlier players of these avoidance games similarly imagined a fiery death would befall their failure to obey the imposed limitations, but the literary evidence for this, at least, is scant. And in any case, the clear growth and appeal of the game, again, Hwang sees as a phenomenon of the latter-half of the 20th century, at least in the US, tying it specifically to the changes in family life and home design, where the growth of the family room as a common and expected part of the American home created a space for children to play in the house that was rarely present in decades past. 

Clear evidence of the development of the game is lacking, and Hwang is careful to note that he ""offers a hypothesis rather than a proof"", but nevertheless he sees a clear, ""suggestive relationship"" between ""The Floor is Lava"" and post-war American family life. The combination of furniture to provide the 'safe zone platforms', the size of the room in comparison to a bedroom, and the casual 'social characteristics' of the family room all combined to make such a game ideally suited to the space.

So in short, children have certainly been avoiding a molten, melty-death on the living room carpet since the 1950s, but whether or not lava or some other fiery danger was what was to be avoided, these 'ground avoidance games' are a very old, and quite worldly, tradition for children through the ages. I will close with one addendum, namely that myself and other mods have been trying to see if we could find an older reference than Dahl *specifically* to lava, or at least a fire floor. No luck yet, but I'd welcome others joining in to help!

However, the authors of this paper do believe that it may be possible to play a short game of 'the walls are lava' if convection currents are taken into account, as long as the room it is being played in doews not have a ceiling and participants attempt to inhale as few gases as possible.

725,AskHistorians,"Are the old Disney movie's portrayal of racial groups (Dumbo's Crows, Peter Pan's Indians, ETC.) Only a modern controversy or did people have problems with them back when they came out too?","With apologies for plucking the low-hanging fruit:

*Song of the South* (1946), the movie so racist it has basically been disavowed by Disney, was also so racist that it inspired controversy even before *production*.

I'm hoping none of us have specifically sought to see it recently, but for those of you who also have never read a plot synopsis: *Song of the South* consists of four animated, animal-populated ""short stories"" wrapped inside a live-action narration/plot. The stories are taken from the *Uncle Remus* books written by Joel Chandler Harris, who gathered them from African-Americans living around Atlanta after the Civil War. Often violent and scary, many of the folktales in the books are allegories for the horrors of slavery and white masters. The Disney adaptation, on the other hand, picks light-hearted stories, matches them with joyful and cute animation, and turns the frame story into a recreation of the antebellum Southern fantasy (mansion of the slave owners, black sharecroppers in shacks, the stock characters of Mammy, Pickaninny, and of course the ""good slave"" Uncle Remus)--complete with a Magical Negro twist to make the white boy's family all good again.

This alteration was readily apparent to critics of the time. Walter White, the executive director of the NAACP, rather diplomatically commented:

>  Making use of the beautiful Uncle
 Remus folklore, *Song of the South unfortunately
 gives the impression of an idyllic master-slave
 relationship which is a distortion of the facts.*

White wrote this after the film's release, but he had been one of the voices in protest when news of an Uncle Remus adaptation leaked out in 1944. According to Thomas Cripps, these early efforts framed themselves as helpful--and it wasn't a stretch, since (as Cripps documents) World War II had served/was serving as a major turning point for black representation in movies (and complaints from the NAACP and other groups when Hollywood was seen to fail). So White, Alain Locke (a former Rhodes Scholar), and Hollywood writers Caleb Peterson and Leon Hardwick reminded Disney to be good about representation or risk massive protests, to avoid ""lowering black morale"" for the war and for America. Disney even initially hired a script doctor to redo the film, and he had plans of mixing the Remus tales with stories drawn from the WPA ex-slave narratives (no, really!). Ultimately, the company reverted to original plans.

The controversy was not quelled upon release. Matthew Bernstein compiled an impressive array of excerpts from contemporary reviewers and commenters. On one hand, you had (white newspaper) *Atlanta Constitution* reporter Doris Lockman's commentary on the film's Atlanta premiere:

>  [The crowd] ...saw the honest
 red dirt of Georgia, the weathered cabins that
 huddle on friendly mounds under tall pines, the
 dusty shabby old servitors of a kindlier day,
 focused richly amid the magic wrought from
 the homely philosophy of Joel Chandler Harris
 and moulded into reality in the facile fingers of
 Walt Disney and his crew... 

> It was everybody's
 picture. Grandmother, seeing it, could remem-
 ber the golden days of yesterday. Her
 daughter, beside her, reached for snatches of
 tales long sleeping and the modern ones realized restively that much has gone from life
 that could ill be spare.

In contrast, *New York Times* columnist Bosley Crowther insisted it was *by no means* ""everybody's picture"":

> For no matter how much one
 argues that it's all childish fiction, anyhow, the
 master-and-slave relation is so lovingly regarded in your [Disney's] yarn, with the Negroes bowing
 and scraping and singing spirituals in the
 night, that one might almost imagine that you
 figure Abe Lincoln made a mistake. Put down
 that mint julep, Mr. Disney!

Ann Tanneyhill of the National Urban League emphastically denounced the movie's ""black ,
fat, greasy, sweaty, laughing, grinning, eyes rolling, white teeth showing
predominantly, bowing, scraping hat in hand"" stereotype. NAACP leader Gloster Current rejected the joint stereotype-myths of the docile slave and that black people *liked* slavery.

And some people suggested further action was necessary. NAACP director White, in response to actually seeing the film, proposed that the organization create a screening or censoring branch to preview. Mary McLeod Bethune called for production companies to include a wider variety of non-white characters in movies with the prescient idea that this might affect overall attitudes towards people of color (she says ""minority groups,"" so, not just black people).

And so even while the harshest critics felt obligated to praise the movie's artistic achievements (probably a mixture of heartfelt and diplomatic, depending on critic), *Song of the South* was in all likelihood a massive economic failure even at the time. Certainly it has failed to provide Disney with the same financial and popular legacy as other wildly problematic movies (""where they cut off your ears if they don't like your face,"" anyone?).

Cripps concludes, ""*Song of the South* clarified movie politics as had no
other movie since *Gone with the Wind.*"" Protests over racial representation and racist stereotypes in movies are hardly an invention of the Internet age.

726,AskHistorians,"James Madison apparently drafted 19 amendments for the bill of rights, but only 12 passed through Congress to the states. What were these 7 amendments, and why weren't they approved?","James Madison didn’t propose 19 specific amendments; he proposed 9 in his address to Congress on June 8, 1789. His original numbering was broken down into which Article was being amended. He thought amendments should replace existing text or be inserted into the text rather than being added onto the end. So for example the bulk of what would become the Bill of Rights was simply his 4th Amendment as he thought they should all go “in article ~~2st~~ 1st, section 9, between clauses 3 and 4.” A single large insert of text was to his mind a single amendment.

This is why you’ll hear various counts of how many amendments he proposed. This is because he himself grouped them differently than in their final adopted form, and at various times different paragraphs were combined or separated into different amendments during debate. Arguably what became the 1st Amendment really should have been 3 different items; freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom to assemble are different rights. But Madison and later Congress grouped them together. This is why people often say he proposed 19 or 20 amendments instead of just 9.

Ultimately he proposed 9 amendments, of which most were reworked into 12 adopted by Congress. Eventually 11 of the 12 would be ratified, although one would take till 1992.

Here’s his 9 original amendments summarized.

1. Alterations to the preamble. Specifically to make clearer that all ultimate power derives from the people. This was rejected and not adopted by Congress.
2. Changes to wording in Article Two regarding the number of Representatives and how many people they could represent. If adopted this change would have capped House seat sizes at 50,000. Which would give us some 6,600 odd members in the House today had it been adopted. This one was approved by Congress, but never ratified by the States.
3. That pay-raises voted on by congress couldn’t come into effect until after the next election. This one was voted on and approved by Congress, but not ratified until 1992 when it became the 27th Amendment. 
4. What would become much of the familiar Bill of Rights. Freedom of Religion, Speech, Assembly, to Bear Arms, to not Quarter Soldiers, Fair Trial, Fair Punishment, from Search, Speedy Trial, and an Enumeration of Powers. These were reworked and regrouped into different arrangements. After debate and reworking this was approved and ratified. 
5. This was basically a proto-incorporation clause requiring the individual  *States* to respect rights of conscience, press, and trial by jury. This was rejected by Congress, although under current law this functionally exists 
6. This was largely what would become the 7th Amendment it offered rules to protect the civil law trial by jury, as well as guarantees for traditional common law. In the final Bill of Rights this was moved up to join the other court related amendments from part 4. This was approved and ratified. 
7. further enumeration of trial protections including details on juries, and grand juries. Parts of this was worked into the eventual 5th Amendment, and was approved and ratified. 
8. Further discussion of the enumeration of powers. This became the bulk of the 9th and 10th amendments. This was to be labeled Article 7. This was approved and ratified. 
9. Relabeling Article 7 in the Constitution to Article 8.

Most of Madison’s proposals were accepted. Of his 9 proposed amendments 1, 5, and 9 were rejected. 1 and 9 because the rest of Congress didn’t want to edit the Constitution directly, but to append amendments to it. 5 was rejected because they didn’t want to try and force rights onto the individual states which in some cases had such rights already. The other 6 proposed amendments were reworked into 12 amendments passed by Congress and sent to the states for ratification. Proposed amendments 1 and 2 failed ratification. So when amendments 3-12 were ratified, they became the common listing we know today, amendments 1-10, with what would become the 27th amendment becoming the last of his proposals to become ratified. 

Today of his proposal, most of it is in the Constitution. Outside some wording, and the constituency maximum requirements for House districts, there’s no major part of his 9 amendments that isn’t law today. There’s only 1 “missing” amendment, not 9.

727,AskHistorians,"For centuries, the Malleus Maleficarum was second only to the Bible in sales. Who was buying it? Up to that time, the church appears to have been skeptical of claims of magic or witchcraft, and the author had been dismissed as senile and crazy; what led to its widespread acceptance and promulgation?","> It is hardly disputed that in the whole vast literature of witchcraft, the most prominent, the most important, the most authoritative volume is the *Malleus Maleficarum (The Witch Hammer)* of Heinrich Kramer (Henricus Institoris) and James Sprenger. The date of the first edition of the *Malleus* cannot be fixed with absolute certainty, but the likeliest year is 1486. There were, at any rate, fourteen editions between 1487 and 1520, and at least sixteen editions between 1574 and 1669. These were issued from the leading German, French and Italian presses. The latest reprint of the original text of the *Malleus* is to be found in the noble four volume collection of Treatises on Witchcraft, ""sumptibus Claudii Bourgeat"", 4to., Lyons, 1669. There is a German translation by J. W. R. Schmidt, *Der Hexenhammer*, 3 vols, Berlin, 1906; second edition, 1922-3.

[...] In fact, ""it fastened on European jurisprudence for nearly three centuries the duty of combating"" the Society of Witches. The *Malleus* lay on the bench of every judge, on the desk of every magistrate. It was the ultimate, irrefutable, unarguable authority. It was implicitly accepted not only by Catholic but by Protestant literature. In fine, it is not too much to say that the *Malleus Maleficarum* is among the most important, wisest, and weightiest books of the world.

- Montague Summers, introduction to the [1948 edition](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=RPml42hWGBIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR14&dq=malleus+maleficarum&ots=Loxt74IIBl&sig=RLuklKHbsBs8ne2KV5UF2p2ZUcI#v=onepage&q&f=false).

You have to take Summers with a grain of salt: while extremely erudite in the subject of the occult, the Reverend's actual belief and tendency toward exaltation of occult literature can skew the perception of facts a little. Nevertheless, it does emphasize that the *Malleus* was extraordinarily popular, and for an extensive period of time. A lot of this had to do with utility and demand.

If you look at the volumes available to authorities on witchcraft in the period, you have works like Johannes Nider's *Formicarius* (1475); while this was popular and helped define the image and concept of the witch as we know it, this work was not geared toward either a lay audience or legal use since it was quite literally written as a teacher-student dialogue on the lives of ants. The section on witchcraft was actually absorbed into the *Malleus*.

And authorities at the period *needed* a work on heresy and witchcraft. Civil courts and authorities were under greater pressure to work with ecclesiastic courts and authorities to address both heresy and *maleficium*, and the framework of Roman Law which was highly influential on the courts of Europe required a certain amount of legalistic wrangling to deal with the contemporary issues of witchcraft. While the Protestant Reformation had not yet occurred, there were still schisms within the church, which inquisitors rooted out as heresy. H. R. Trevor-Roper in [The European Witch-Craze of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries](http://www.worldcat.org/title/european-witch-craze-of-the-sixteenth-and-seventeenth-centuries/oclc/426461901) writes:

> When the Dominicans pressed for inquisitorial power over witchcraft, the papacy had at first resisted. The old canons of the Church, and particularly the *canon Episcopi*, denied the reality of witches and forbade their persecution. Therefore, in 1257, Pope Alexander IV had refused these demands unless manifest heresy, not merely witchcraft, could be proved. But little by little, under constant pressure, the papacy had yielded.  The great surrender had been made by the French popes of Avignon, and particularly by the two popes from southern France, John XXII and his successor Benedict XII, who had already, as bishops in Languedoc, waged war on nonconformity in the old Albigensian and Vaudois areas. John XXII, who declared heretical the Franciscan doctrine of the poverity of Christ (so dangerously akin to the old Vaudois ideas), also, by his constitution *Super illius specula* of 1325, authorized he full use of inquisitorial procedure against witches, of who he lived in personal terror. For the next century and a half--until the Witch Bull of Innocent VIII, and indeed afterwards--the main effort of the inquisitors (although there were some spectacular 'political' witchcraft trials in France, Burgundy and England) had been directed against the witches of the Alps and the Pyrenees.

Summers gives a good run-down of some of the ""political"" witchcraft trials in his introduction to the *Malleus*; sorcery was effectively the civil counterpart to the ecclesiastical charge of heresy, and civil authorities could actually pass mortal sentences, which ecclesiastical courts could not--this was the standard inquisitorial practice, to hand over heretics to secular authorities for further persecution and punishment. This practice applied to all cases before the inquisition, not just the political ones, so as the *scope* of the inquisition expanded to include witchcraft, the need by civil authorities to address the question of witchcraft expanded as well. This brings us to Pope Innocent VIII, who in 1484:

> [...] issued *Summis desiderantes* at the request of two Dominican inquisitors, Heinrich Kramer (or Institoris) and Jacob Sprenger, who had worked in southern Germany and encountered some resistance in their search for heretics. The Bull formally removes all impediments to the completion of Kramer and Sprenger's mission.

- Edward Peters, [The Magician, The Witch, and the Law](http://www.worldcat.org/title/magician-the-witch-and-the-law/oclc/751378767), 170

Peters goes on to note that the Papal bull was not, in itself, remarkable - previous popes had issued bulls with much the same language and for much the same purpose, to authorize members of the clergy and clear away local opposition. However, two years after it was issue, it was included as the preface to the *Malleus Maleficarum* - a text Innocent himself had probably never seen - and in that context, being bundled with the book, gave the book greater authority, beyond even the area of Germany which most concerned the inquisitors. This in part helped its transmission, but the other part is the nature of the book itself. Peters 173-174:

> All scholars agree that the form of the work, that of a series of scholastic *quaestiones*, derives from handbooks for inquisitors, of which Eymeric's is the best example. Within the framework of *quaestiones* arranged into three major parts, owever, the work is intellectually inferior to Eymeric's and hardly to be considered ""scholastic"" in the original sense of that term at all. What is striking about the *Malleus* is its economic use of the *quaestio* form to bring together elements from all of the diverse sources that had provided elements of the new fifteenth-century beliefs in magic in the first place. The juxtaposition of these elements in a single, concentrated, tightly argued treatise of considerably greater length than any earlier work really constituted the basis of the popularity of the *Malleus* during the next two centuries. [...] In no other work are theology and law so tightly linked. Even if, as I have suggested above, the *Malleus* made no discernible impact on the prosecution of magicians and witches for nearly half a century, no comparable work approached its comprehensiveness until those of Bodin and Remy, Del Rio and Boguet, at the end of the sixteenth century.

The *Malleus* was not alone in its generation. Writings about witchcraft, even printed works, were extensive, with titles like *Tractatus contra Daemonum Invocatores* (1450) by Jean Vinet, *Fortalicium fidei contra fidei christianae hostes* (1467) by Alfonso de Spina, *Flagellum Maleficorum* (c.1490) by Petrus Mamoris. The *Laienspiegel* (1509) by Ulrich Tengler in particular was incredibly popular, because like the *Malleus* it was a legal work looking at the different aspects of witchcraft in regard to private, public, and criminal law; it went through fourteen editions. But the *Malleus* was uniquely suited to spread, because of its relatively early date, because it was organized in a manner useful to legal authorities, and because the spread of the printing press made it much more accessible to this ready market that was in demand for such a way. Judges and magistrates required a legal text for dealing with the problems posed by accusations of sorcery and heresy, and the *Malleus* was almost encyclopedic compared to other contemporary texts.

This, combined with the popularity of the *Malleus* and its relative accessibility also made it something of an authority on witchcraft which many subsequent demonologists would refer to, quote from, or cite as a reference; a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy where a book is popular because it is known to be popular. While there is a popular rumor that it was banned by the Church and placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, I haven't been able to confirm that with any of my sources at hand. "
728,AskHistorians,Why is Liechtenstein?,"I love Liechtenstein!

The short answer is three parts: **a late start**, **good alliances**, **not being a belligerent.**

**A Late Start**

First of all, you wouldn't consider Liechtenstein to be a ""country"" or even an ""independent principality"" by contemporary European standards until 1719. Before that, the area was barely occupied, and variously controlled to different degrees by the Holy Roman Empire, and was also traded around various dynasties and families for a couple of hundred years. That's why we don't think about Liechtenstein being captured in the Swabian War in 1499, or the Thirty Years' War from 1618-1648, for examples, because it wasn't Liechtenstein then. It was a couple of little hamlets and a castle or two. It doesn't even get a mention in the Wikipedia articles on those conflicts.

Compare this with Vatican City---which was either trying to control the rest of the peninsula or the whole world since about the 8th century, being controlled by the locals, or getting booted out to France---or compare with Malta, which has been occupied for 7,000 years and conquered by every one with a boat from the Romans to the Muslims to the Normans to the French. Plus the British got Malta for a signature in the Treaty of Paris. So yeah, a late start is reason number one.

**Good Alliances**

Things are pretty quiet in Liechtenstein during from 1719 onward until Napoleon starts conquering much of Europe. Most notably for our story his victories at Ulm and Austerlitz in 1805 lead to the Treaty of Pressburg (aka Bratislava), which pretty much shatters Liechtenstein's hope of maintaining their Austrian friends. Within a few months Napoleon is building the Confederation of the Rhine. This is an agreement among a bunch of conquered/nervous German princes to provide taxes and troops for Napoleon's future conquests. But in order to get the princes to sign up, a process called *German mediatization* was conducted in which various states were merged and properties handed over. In short, ""Ok, I'll join your confederation, but only if you declare my neighbor's house to be part of my house and you give me all their stuff.""

Maximilian I of Bavaria wanted to mediatize Liechtenstein as part of his deal to sign up for the Confederation, but Napoleon refused. The reason was because Johann von Liechtenstein---who was part of the negotiations back at the Treaty of Pressburg---really impressed Napoleon. So, Lichtenstein got be a co-founder of the Confederation and maintain their sovereignty.

The Confederation collapsed within a decade because Napoleon stopped winning all the time. And technically the French occupied the country for a minute there, but again because Johann and Napoleon were buddies it still operated pretty independently. 

Next up, Lichtenstein joins the new German Confederation until that starts to fall apart in the 1860s. The country gets a new constitution with some representative democracy, and officially declares itself permanently neutral. 

So what about the 20th century? The Austrian ties do create problems during World War I, and the Allies impose an embargo. Lichtenstein forms a monetary alliance with the ever-neutral Swiss to stay afloat. After the war, they sign a treaty with the Swiss to let them handle tons of their diplomatic needs elsewhere.

In World War II, Liechtenstein's alliances also come in handy. They remain neutral, even when the dynasty's hereditary lands over in central Europe get claimed by Czechoslovakia and Poland as they are reclaiming territory from the retreating German army. Liechtenstein also gave asylum to about five hundred German-allied Russian soldiers in 1945. They got them permanently resettled in South America. For a country that was struggling to feed its own, this was considered a great sacrifice. Other German-allied Russian soldiers that were granted asylum elsewhere in the world were repatriated to the USSR, and often executed.

No neutral country in World War II got consumed into a larger country, but Liechtenstein wasn't even able to join the UN. That's because there was a fear that the Soviet Union would pressure small states to leverage their votes. This may have further helped secure their identity as an independent actor for the rest of the 20th century.

**Not Being a Belligerent.**

You asked ""how did such a tiny nation not become totally absorbed and assimilated into the fold of a larger nation?"" The answer is that it basically did. Geopolitically, Lichtenstein is pretty much Switzerland. Culturally, it's pretty much Austria. Most of the Lichtenstein's history it avoided being consumed by another Germanic state by participating in confederations. Then it declared itself neutral, and managed to maintain that into the 20th century. 

Other modern micronations or would-be micronations have tended to get involved or traded about in conflicts. Andorra fought with the Moors, got passed around among various French, Catalan, and religious rulers, declared war on Germany in World War I, and got occupied by the French following unrest in their 1933 elections. In the Low Countries, only one of the Seventeen Provinces (Luxembourg) survives as its own country today. The rest variously split off to form the Dutch Republic, were divided up by feuding families, or became part of the kickoff for the Eighty Year's War. Most of the US Territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virigin Islands, Wake Island, etc.) were the results of conquests or land swaps or just purchases for the strategic military advantage.

**The TL;DR Summary**

Lichtenstein avoided becoming the name of a province in Austria because they got a late start being defined as a country by that name, because Johann I impressed Napoleon, because the confederations they joined held up long enough to keep them from getting conquered, and because they decided to stop picking sides well before the start of the 20th century. 

P.S. I'm tempted to rewrite this entire post in a James Burke style ""Because Johann was a smooth operator"" but you'll just have to imagine that.

729,AskHistorians,"In Hamilton, Aaron Burr has the line ""I hear wailing in the streets"" after he kills Hamilton, but Hamilton had a tarnished reputation and was unpopular at the time. Were common New Yorkers (or Americans in general) as distraught as the play would suggest?","This is a great question and reasonable to ask if you’ve watched the musical.  As the musical shows, that by the time of Hamilton's death, he underwent both a serious scandal following his own publication of the [95-page Reynolds Pamphlet](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-21-02-0138-0002) and his multiple public confrontations between other leading figures, like Adams and Jefferson. However, Hamilton was still a very-well known figure and his death was seen as a huge shock to not only New Yorkers, but many Americans spread throughout the United States.

By his death in 1804, Alexander Hamilton was a very well-known figure across America. First made famous for his participation in the victory at Yorktown in 1781, Hamilton rose through the public ranks quickly through the 1780s and 1790s. His political and legal career also kept him constantly in the spotlight, both by friends and enemies typically through the press.  People knew him not only for these accolades, but also as someone who was profoundly influential in drafting the new US Constitution and also was well-respected by George Washington, whom everyone still adored. So the shock and sadness, as described in the musical wasn't only shared by people who supported Hamilton, but a general sense of horror that such a well-known figure could be killed in a duel.

As [Ron Chernow explains in his biography of Hamilton](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292945/alexander-hamilton-by-ron-chernow/), ""When a handwritten notice of Hamilton’s death went up at the Tontine Coffee House, the city was transfixed with horror... Even Burr’s friend Charles Biddle conceded that “there was as much or more lamentation as when General Washington died... Unlike at Washington’s death, however, the sorrow was laced with shock and chagrin at the senselessness of Hamilton’s demise.""(1)

Hamilton's death gripped Americans everywhere.  Newspapers ran headlines going over the unexpected death and church bells rung out in cities like Philadelphia and Boston to mourn his passing. As Chernow, and other biographers explained, many factors led to this outpouring of support. Among them, Hamilton was only 47* when he died, he left behind a young grieving family with many several children, his history of service to America echoed in people's minds and his painful end at the hands of the Vice President enabled Hamilton to finally, ""achieve in death what had so often eluded him in life: an emotional outpouring of sympathy from all strata of New York society.""(2)

Biographers describe New York in July, 1804 as being in grieving as a city because they lost their 'most distinguished citizen.' The New York Common Council urged all businesses to be closed on the day of his funeral, which turned into a huge spectacle. Not only was the crowds huge for the procession, but New York militia came out to bear arms and do military drum rolls and ships in the harbor few their sails at half-mast. Chernow explained, ""It was the grandest and most solemn funeral in the city’s history to date."" (3)

Ultimately, the musical didn't exaggerate that New Yorkers and Americans in general were shocked at Hamilton's unexpected death and openly grieved together. 

*Hamilton's date of birth is in dispute. Some sources believe he was born in 1755 and others in 1757, which means he was either 47 or 49 when he was killed.

731,AskHistorians,Pedophilia of Catholic priests has occurred on a fairly large scale and is an increasingly well known occurrence in the modern day. Was this at all a problem (or a well known one) in Medieval Europe? How often would priests be known to break the Church's rules on sexuality?,"While I think u/sunagainstgold did a great job, I'd like to talk about this question in the context of one particular and very notable attempt at addressing this problem in the Middle Ages. 

St. Peter Damian, dubbed the ""Doctor of Reform"" in the 19th century, was a prominent reformer in the 11th century who wrote many letters and treatises on the issues of sexual immorality in the Church, with a particular emphasis on sodomy and pederasty. Pedophilia in the Catholic Church was absolutely a problem in the Middle Ages, and I would argue that Damian made it more well known than the Church at the time would've probably preferred. 

As the other commenter pointed out, the clergy were subject to a different set of laws than the laity. The clergy were generally exempt from civil law, and were instead subject to the Church's canon law. That said, the enforcement of that law was not always as strong as reformers like Damian would've preferred. Damian explicitly blames bishops and their lack of willingness to provide discipline, which he believes stems from a fundamental misunderstanding they had about their role in the Church. He believed bishops should act as teachers and spiritual guides, but many if not most bishops viewed themselves as princes or lords of the Church, treating Church property as if it were their own. This allowed them to rule as they saw fit, and the position was somewhat understandable as a vast majority of these bishops had bought their way into their position. Damian wrote letters to both Pope Nicholas II and Pope Leo IX to convince them to act on what he saw as a widespread problem, and neither Pope really did as he asked. Leo IX responded in a letter where he “appreciated and confirmed \[Damian’s\] findings of the continuous existence of deviant sexual behaviors and child sexual abuse within clerical ranks” (Rashid and Barron 2018) but he disagreed on how they should be handled. Damian believed offenders should be cast out of the Church, and Leo IX was hesitant to do so. He only deposed long-term repeat offenders. 

Damian, understandably, grew very frustrated with the Church leaders and their refusal to address the problem himself. He shifted his tone around the mid-11th century, suggesting that if the Church could not reform itself, then the laity was responsible for reforming it. His treatises ended up being widely distributed and read among both the laity and the clergy, although we must remember that most of the population at the time was not particularly literate, so it's difficult to say how far his messages reached. 

I would say it is difficult to estimate how large of a problem sexual abuse was in the Church since the stance of Pope Leo IX set a precedent for relatively lax punishments, and our only true records of these events transpiring come from others describing them or ecclesiastical court documents. Damian suspected, as do I, that the Church's primary motivation in not prosecuting these cases came from a desire to cover up the problem to keep the laity from judging the Church. Damian's adamant calls for reform and Pope Leo IX's response confirming that it was a widespread problem leads me to conclude that it was most likely worse and more widespread than officially recorded cases.

732,AskHistorians,"As I understand it, the earliest Christians expected Jesus to return imminently, or at least within their lifetime. How was the Church able to handle it, and even grow exponentially, when this didn't happen? At what point was this no longer the predominant expectation of new converts?","> How was the Church able to handle it, and even grow exponentially, when this didn't happen?

1 Thessalonians addresses exactly this problem: What do you say to Christians who are disappointed that Jesus hasn't yet returned? In chapter four, Paul addresses the Thessalonians' concerns about “those who sleep in death” \(4.13\). It appears \(based on Paul's reply; we don't have the letter to which he is responding\) that the Thessalonians had been given the impression that Christ's second coming was imminent; when members of the community died before Christ's return, the survivors worried that their fallen brothers and sisters would therefore be excluded from the new kingdom. Paul reassures them that

>we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever \(4.15\-17\).

In other words, there are contingencies in place for those who succumb to death before the end of the world. There is a plan, Paul reassures them, for an extended wait.

Paul also makes the timeline a little more vague. In the next chapter, he reminds the Thessalonians of a particular aspect of his earlier teaching, telling them that “about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night” \(5.1\-2\). That is, no one knows when the end will come, as like a thief it will come by surprise. This might strike you as somewhat surprising itself, as speculation about the end of the world typically includes all kinds of signs that indicate *when* the end is nigh \(cf. 2 Thessalonians 2, where Paul offers a number of signs \(one reason some scholars doubt its authenticity\)\). Why would Paul preach to the Thessalonians that the exact timing of the end of the world is impossible to predict? Well, if the world does not end when he says it will, he's going to have a lot of disappointed people. Better to be vague. This is sometimes referred to as “delayed eschatology:” The end of the world is DEFINITELY coming, but it's coming at some ill\-defined point in the future. That way, Christianity can have the end of the world as central to its beliefs without it dominating present considerations.

There were many other strategies employed, but these \(& the realized eschatology of Luke\) are the earliest & some of the most influential.

>At what point was this no longer the predominant expectation of new converts?

It's hard to say what the majority of early converts believed, as we simply don't have access to that sort of data. What evidence we do have –\- a handful of 1st century Christian texts –\- doesn't express too much interest in imminent eschatology. As 1 Thessalonians suggests, even the earliest converts were dissuaded from thinking of the end of the world as something that would occur soon. Similarly, in 1 Timothy there's lots of talk about establishing a church hierarchy, rearing children, planning for the future, etc. You wouldn't expect Christians to be doing those sorts of things if they thought the world was going to end next week.

That said, there's never been a point in Christian history when someone wasn't preaching that the world was about to end. Indeed, this sort of message is especially effective at attracting converts. The problem is that imminent eschatology doesn’t lend itself to the creation of the sort of enduring institutions that a religion needs to grow and prosper. There's an excellent modern example of this in Seventh\-Day Adventism \(see Lawson, “The Persistence of Apocalypticism Within a Denominationalizing Sect”\): Converts are drawn in with a promise of imminent destruction, but comparatively little is said about the end of the world among established members of the church. It's difficult to get people to plan and build and foster community if they think God is about to wipe everything away.

Rather than think of imminent eschatology as a Christian belief that was superseded, then, it might be better to think of it as a persistent Christian belief that is specifically targeted at potential converts. Telling people that the world is about to end is a great way to scare the crap out of them and get them to join, but the messaging usually shifts once they're on the inside. Hook 'em with the fire and brimstone, then give them their assignment for next week's bake sale."
733,AskHistorians,"Did the ancient Sumerians have any notion that they were the first ""civilization"". How did they perceive themselves, their neighbours and their history in regards to this?","This is an answer I gave to a similar question several years ago.

So I'm only gonna be talking about the Sumerians here. The only way that we are going to have any knowledge of what the first civilizations knew of their past is through written records. Writing first appears in Sumer in around 3000 BC, this is during the Uruk period (4000-3001 BC). At this time it was very much proto-writing and did not develop into a full written language until the Early Dynastic Period (2800-2500 BC)

It is not until the end of the Early Dynastic Period (2300 BC) that we see the emergence of the Sumerian King List which documents the kings of Sumer and gives us an insight into what the Sumerians may have believed about their past.

The King List, a collection of several sources, details the rulers of the cities of Sumer from the first antediluvian rulers to the last dynasty of Isin. The first king was Alulim, first king of Eridu. He ruled for 28,800 years. Now at first glance that may seem an unreasonably long rule and that is because it is. Alulim, the first king after the kingship descended from heaven created by the god Enki is clearly almost entirely mythical. This list of antediluvian kings ends with Ubara-tutu and the coming of the great flood that wipes the world clean.

The list resumes with Jushur the first of the dynasty of Kish. He ruled for 1200 years. 20 kings and 15255 years later we have En-me-barage-si who is the first king we have archaeological evidence for. He is dated from around 2600 BC from two pieces of alabaster vases found at Nippur which bear his name. Though he ruled for 900 years, a rather long time, it can be surmised that he is indeed real. He is mentioned also in the Epic of Gilgamesh alongside Gilgamesh himself giving credence to the thought that Gilgamesh is a historical figure. The King List continues into the time of rulers that can easily be verified such as Sargon of Akkad who ruled for 40 years and founded the Akkadian Empire. Thus we see the transition of the mythical into the semi-mythical and then verifiable history. But more on that later.

The Sumerian creation myth is important to note in this discussion. It recounts that the gods Enki among them created the first “black-headed people” (the Sumerians) and settled them in the land giving them the kingship and thus the first cities were created. A large part of the story is missing but at some point the gods decide not to save mankind from a flood which strikes destroying man and cites. Later the world is presumably repopulated.

In addition there is the “Debate between Summer and Winter” a creation myth from the mid 3nd millennium. This details the creation of the land and seasons by Enlil. In it he is seen to irrigate the land “guaranteeing the spring floods at the quay” and to begin the agricultural tradition of the land “making flax grow and barley proliferate.”

Finally and most interestingly for this topic is the “Debate between Sheep and Grain” another creation myth written in the mid-3rd millennium . The myth details a time in which sheep and grain were unknown to the land. The people “went about with naked limbs in the Land. Like sheep they ate grass with their mouths and drank water from the ditches.” The myth ends with the virtues of grain being extolled “from sunrise to sunset may the name of Grain be praised. People should submit to the yoke of grain.”

Therefore we can see that early history of Mesopotamia, the Ubaid period and before, is in Sumerian text seen in a divine light. The land was created by the gods as were the people and they were given cities and kingship. Enlil gave the people the summer and the winter, he gave them wheat and irrigation as Enki gave them kingship. Only in the “Debate between Sheep and Grain” is there indicated any knowledge of a time before sedentary agriculture. This myth clashes with that of the “Debate between Summer and Winter” though it is part of the same tradition indicating the lack of a unified view of their past. It seems that the Sumerians saw their past as part of a very real mythical tradition. Their kings begin as mythical figures and progress towards the non-mythical. The mythical and the non-mythical are closely linked in the Sumerian view of themselves and their past

I would conclude that the Sumerians did believe themselves to be not just the first civilization but the first people, it is part of their creation myth. In addition there was no knowledge in the way we would think of a hunter-gatherer life preceding their urban civilization. If there is any hint it exists as another facet of the extensive and contradictory creation myth of the peoples of Sumer.

735,AskHistorians,"If I were a sick legionary in the Roman army, come down with bad fever or stomach flu, and tomorrow is the big battle, would I be expected to fight like usual alongside all my healthy comrades?","Rome is a really interesting case to look at medicine in the military, because it's an important time in history where battlefield medicine actually pushed civilian medicine forward rather than the other way around. (Clarification upon request: *overall*, not just in terms of emergency medicine and wound treatment--things like preventative health and even, it seems, social attitudes towards physicians).

We do have to be careful to distinguish time periods within ""ancient Rome."" In *Man and Wound in the Ancient World,* Richard Gabriel points to a few key turning points in Roman history that spurred advances in medical treatment for soldiers, both during and outside of battle. This refers both to organization/personnel and to medical knowledge/skills.

For the Republican period as a whole, battle medicine seems to have been left up to individual people. John Scarborough points to influence from the Greek world that pushed Roman military commanders to hire and pay their own *personal* medical officers. How far down into the legion that care extended, had to depend on the individual commander. There are a lot of references in sources to soldiers treating themselves, but also to the occasional commander like Publius Scipio seeing to it that the physician treating his wounds also treated his soldiers'.

A major jump forward comes before and during the Gallic Wars, so around the time of Caesar. Our good friend Cicero indicates that soldiers could probably expect a medic to come treat their wounds, which indicates a step forward in terms of organizational sophistication:

> Moreover, we often see, when the wounded are carried off the field, the raw, untried soldier, though but slightly wounded, cries out most shamefully; but the more brave, experienced veteran only inquires for some one to dress his wounds

If this seems like a tangent, it's not quite: you'll notice Cicero's very classically Stoic perspective on gutting up, dealing with wounds, and carrying on. Would a *proper* Roman soldier let himself be stopped by a case of the sniffles?

Perhaps not, but he didn't always have a choice! Julius Caesar himself indicates this in Gallic War, VI:

> Sextius Baculus, who had led a principal century under Caesar (of whom we have made mention in previous engagements), **had been left an invalid in the garrison, and had now been five days without food.** He, distrusting his own safety and that of all, goes forth from his tent unarmed; he sees that the enemy are close at hand and that the matter is in the utmost danger; he snatches arms from those nearest, and stations himself at the gate.

(ETA: See /u/TangosWithNapalm's remarks below for a [deeper analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5ja310/if_i_were_a_sick_legionary_in_the_roman_army_come/dbfed37/) of this passage.)

At this period in time, disease among soldiers was hot on the consciousness of military commanders. Around then and through to the civil wars following Caesar's assassination, apparently diseases ravaged the ranks even more than usual. This helped push the next major innovation in Roman battlefield medicine: attention to the *prevention* of sickness.

By the full blossoming of the imperial period, especially in the first centuries CE, Roman military medicine was amazingly sophisticated for its day in terms of professionalization and official support, preventative health, and wound care--the sooner the better. Sanitation, exercise, and good diet were seen as vital to ensuring the most fit troops possible. Roy Davies even describes forts that had *indoor* exercise areas for maintaining fitness in bad weather. This focus on preventative medicine shows an emphasis on entering battle with the best, healthiest, fittest army possible. 

And when things went wrong, the Roman Empire was not about to throw away its valuables. One of the key planks of the newly professionalized military medical service was the inclusion of a hospital or convalescence area in military forts. We might see this as an institutionalization of what Caesar referenced: a place where sick or injured soldiers had *time* to heal, under professional direction, rather than being left to the chancey abilities (and existence...) of a local civilian population.

So while the Stoic underpinnings of the Roman worldview led to poetic proclamations and probably an underlying valuation on sucking it up, at least by the time of the Roman Empire, the military thought it best to go into battle with hearty and hale troops. Although *direct* references are scanty, and surely the line between ""sickness"" and ""health"" varied incredibly from person to person and needs-of-battle to needs-of-battle, there was definitely a point where Romans recognized it was better for everyone concerned to stay behind."
736,AskHistorians,"Did the Hanging Gardens of Babylon actually exist, and has definitive proof been found? Why is it the only wonder whose location has not been definitely found?","Yes, the current consensus is that the Hanging Gardens existed. Or, we know at least that the Assyrian kings did build extravagant gardens and could devise very elaborate, technologically advanced watering systems, as described by Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, and Philo of Byzantium. But, the classical and cuneiform sources provide many different, sometimes conflicting, details about the existence of various royal gardens. I'm personally a bit dubious whether there ever existed the ONE Hanging Gardens of Babylon: the classical literary traditions might be a conflation of a number of different stories about royal gardens in the East. But, Stephanie Dalley, a now retired assyriologist from Oxford University who has written [a book](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Mystery_of_the_Hanging_Garden_of_Bab.html?id=6IUivLRnGC0C&redir_esc=y) and various articles about the Gardens, has come up with a nice theory for the location of the Gardens that does reconcile the classical tradition somewhat with the archaeological evidence - although her theory does (and probably will) remain unproven.

Dalley thinks the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were located at the Palace of Sennacherib at Nineveh. Her reason for thinking that the Gardens never actually existed at Babylon is that many generally reliable classical authors, who describe Babylon to some length and who should be interested in exactly this sort of marvels, such as Herodotus (I.181), Xenophon (in *Cyropaedia*), or Pliny the Elder (*Nat. Hist.* VI. 123) never mention any gardens - even though they do describe the magnificent walls of the city. And, even more seriously, archaeological finds or cuneiform sources in Babylon give no signs of the Gardens. Notably, king Nebuchadnezzar, to whom the wonder was attributed by classical authors, says nothing about any gardens in the abundant inscriptions that record his building-works in the city. The famous classical descriptions of the gardens, from which we know them, come from:   

1. Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC), an engineer who wrote technical treatises, described the watering system of the gardens to some length; but we do not know what is his source.   
2. Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC, 10.1-6) quoting Ctesias of Cnidus, a c. 400 BC historian of Persia and Assyria; Ctesius’ works are lost but he’s generally considered a somewhat unreliable source.    
3. The geographer Strabo (1st century AD, XVI 1.5), who according to his own words based his account of Persia in e.g. written eyewitness stories of the officers of Alexander the Great. It’s not clear who is his source for the Garden of Babylon.  
4. The Jewish author Josephus (1st century AD, *Contr. Apion.* I 19-20; *Antiquities of the Jews* X 11.1), saying that he has based his knowledge on Berossus, a Babylonian priest who apparently wrote history in Greek in 3rd century BC; Josephus’ account is thus often considered the most legit     
5. Quintus Curtius Rufus (1st century AD, *History of Alexander* V 1.35), who’s description of the garden is thought to rely on Clitarchus, a late 4th century BC historian who compiled his own *History of Alexander* from contemporary eye-witness sources.  

There is an extremely handy [website](http://www.plinia.net/wonders/gardens/hg22.html) that has collected together all the classical sources in English translation. So, the thing to note here is that none of these people writing about the Garden of ’Babylon’ had ever visited Babylon, not to mention Persia, expect perhaps Philo, of whose life we know nothing. And, they’re writing about the old history and geography of a distant region, the languages of which they could not themselves speak; it’s a game of Chinese whispers in Greek, Aramaic, Old Persian, and cuneiform… Classical authors regularly conflate or are mislead by their indigenous sources and get details about both the Persian past and present wrong. For example, Josephus attributed the Gardens to Nebuchadnezzar, but he was also the most famous ancient Mesopotamian king known in classical antiquity who just becomes a short-hand for ”famous Eastern king who did lots of stuff”: quite a number of things that he never historically did get attributed to him in classical tradition. The Greeks also understood the history of Mesopotamia within a faulty framework of three successive monarchies, Assyria, Media, and Persia, completely omitting the Neo-Babylonian kingdom (which Nebuchadnezzar ruled), so they often keep getting names and successive rules of Eastern monarchs wrong. The Greek and Jewish tradition weren’t very good at keeping track of names of Eastern cities: they specifically mix up Nineveh and Babylon, something that also happens in the Biblical texts (e.g. II Chronicles 33:11 says that Assyrians took Manasseh captive to Babylon, which was at the time a ruin; it ought to say Nineveh).

So, it’s not difficult to accept that the classical tradition just got the location of the Gardens wrong. Dalley then further goes onto identify Nineveh as the location of the Gardens and the king of Assyria Sennacherib (705 BC to 681 BC) as their builder. One of the main reasons for this is that Sennacherib describes at length in his records that he commissioned engineering works to bring mountain water to Nineveh, in order to provide water for drinking and for a garden that he had built. There’s also an architectural relief in Nineveh by Sennacherib’s grandson Assurbanibal, which shows a lavish garden: [picture of the sculpture](http://cdn.biblicalarchaeology.org/wp-content/uploads/nineveh-garden.jpg), and here’s a [drawing](http://www.bibelwissenschaft.de/fileadmin/buh_bibelmodul/media/wibi/image/sw_WILAT_Paradies_2.jpg)where it’s a bit easier to see what’s going on. 

Sennacherib's garden has for long been considered as a sort of ’proto-type’ of the Hanging Gardens, but Dalley thinks we should in fact consider them as *the* Hanging Gardens. We should note that the Greek description for ’hanging’ gardens does not imply the same as the English, i.e. plants with their roots higher than the actual leaves and top. A close reading of the sources could indeed support a garden like the one described in the sculpture relief: a naturalistic landscape rising up in tiers ""like a (Greek) theatre"" (Diodorus Siculus): forest trees are planted in it in terraced levels, and water is brought into the garden along an aqueduct which is incorporated into the terracing. There’s also a decorative pavilion or small palace in the relief, which might correspond to the ""royal lodges of every description"" which Diodorus mentioned. The only issue is that there’s no devices of raising water in huge quantities to the garden, just how ”streams of water emerging from elevated sources flow partly in a straight line down sloping channels” (Philo). But, the relief is broken in the middle, and it’s possible that the picture did show some water-raising device, too.

So, [here’s](http://imgur.com/a/MN5dc) artist Terry Ball’s picture of the ’Hanging Gardens of Babylon’ based on Dalley’s instructions and the Nineveh relief. 

Dalley further backs up her argument by noting that Sennacherib conquered and destroyed Babylon to shambles during his rule, rendering the city completely deserted for some seven years; so, technically he was the ’king of Babylon’. And, Dalley thinks there might be some evidence that during this time Nineveh as Sennacherib’s capital was considered as ’New Babylon’, further explaining the later confusion. This is possible, but all this is bit shaky proof for Nineveh as the definite location for the Gardens. The Nineveh theory is mainly based on that sculptural relief, and it’s easy to make the literary descriptions and the very scarce historical evidence we have to fit the picture when we want to make it happen, considering how much room for speculation there is. Her theory is lovely and certainly works, but we should note that there were other lavish gardens in Mesopotamia that might have just as well been the source of the classical tradition; the kings quite liked bragging about gardens and engineering works in public inscriptions. For example, the banquet stela of Assurnasirpal II from Nimrud described his engineering works that brought mountain water to his garden at Nimrud, and the huge party he held when the work was completed, entertaining more than 69,000 people with extravaganza. 

TL;DR: Some gardens definitely did exist in Mesopotamia; to what extent they were THE Gardens of Babylon, is open to interpretation.

737,AskHistorians,"How did a provocative dance like belly dancing come out of conservative Islamic countries? If it was pre-Islamic, how did it survive centuries of conservative laws for women?","My experience is with Egyptian dance, but I suggest looking into the research by Sahra C. Kent (Sahra Saeeda) and Heather Ward (Nisaa of St. Louis). Sahra does a seminar series called Journey Through Egypt in which she discusses Egyptian culture and dance and how dance has evolved from local social dance to stage performance, and Heather Ward is the author of  *Egyptian Belly Dance in Transition: The Raqs Sharqi Revolution, 1890-1930.*

Modern Egyptian belly dance has evolved from the dances of the Awalim ( female singers, dancers, musicians who performed for the lower and middle classes in private residences) and Ghawazee, dancers who performed for the rural populations in public. Awalim, while being of a similar social class to the Ghawazee, were held in higher esteem because they performed in private, higher class residences, whereas Ghawazee performed in public.

In the 1830s, King Muhammad Ali banned public performances by these two groups, as well as prostitution in urban areas, and when they were able to return decades later, the lines between the two blurred.

In the 1890s, the new style *raqs sharqi* (what we know as belly dance) developed with the advent of entertainment halls.

Costuming and movement styles would evolve with influences from the film industry and western influences such as ballet. I'm sure Mahmoud Reda, one of the founders of the Reda Dance Troupe, had a large influence on the evolution of this movement as he studied multiple forms of dance, including ballet, and trained many dancers over the course of his life. According to Nada El Masriya, there isn't a professional belly dancer in Egypt who hasn't taken at least some foundational ballet. You can see it in the terminology and movement vocabulary currently taught.

I would also say that the Reda Troupe had a large hand in bringing the dance styles to the rest of the world, via the Reda Troupe and his and Farida Fahmy's involvement in the Egyptian film industry, which featured a lot of oriental dancers, such as Tahiya Carioca, Samia Gamal, Soheir Zaki, and Nagwa Fouad.

You have to understand though, that Egypt has a very complicated relationship with its native music and dance forms. They aren't exactly viewed as high art by many people. And dancers can often be viewed as ""loose women."" Like, they may want a dancer at their wedding, celebration, etc, but they would never want their daughter to become a dancer. And even professional dancers (native, not western ones) will be sure to distance themselves from the Awalim and Ghawazee traditions because of stigma.

I won't speak about Orientalism, as I haven't done a ton of research into that area at this time.

It is important to note that homestyle dance and stage performance are very different. While they share some movement vocabulary, belly dance for the stage, depending on the style, does tend to be more seductive, because you are portraying a sort of fantasy, or playing a character. But the seductive nature of it will vary depending on your audience.

I am an Egyptian style dancer who has been studying for the last 8 years with various native Egyptian and Western teachers, and I have taken the first two levels of Sahra C. Kent's JtE series and have sat in lectures by Heather Ward."
738,AskHistorians,Someone who was a slave as a child could have been in their 90's when MLK Jr. was active. Did any former slaves get to see or meet him?,"I initially wrote this in response to a comment which was then deleted. But I think I it is sufficiently detailed to be a top-level post. 

as /u/ckley said.

[Sylvester magee](https://books.google.com/books?id=bLEDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA10&dq=America%E2%80%99s%20Oldest%20Citizen%20Dies%20in%20Mississippi%20at%20130%22&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q=jefferson&f=false) was *allegedly* the last living person to have been a slave when he died in 1971.  I say allegedly because this is solely based on his accounts. He had no documentation proving his birth as a slave or his participation in the civil war (or of his age as the case may be).   Although not strictly historical, standard practices relating to super centenarians require some documentation of age, lest someone merely claim they were born in 1880 and say they're the oldest living person. 

Eliza Moore was the last known person to have been *documented* to have been born a slave when she died in 1948 at the age of 105.  As of the 1860's she had been documented as being the slave of a Dr. Taylor in Meigs Alabama. [A text of her obituary](http://files.usgwarchives.net/al/montgomery/obits/emoore.txt)   She would have been 20 when she was emancipated. 

Alfred Blackburn of North Carolina died in 1951 at the age of 108, he was allegedly the last living person in North Carolina to have been a slave, and the last person to have received a confederate pension in north Carolina. (he served as a manservant to an officer in the confederate army). 

[Cudjoe Lewis](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/barracoon-cudjo-lewis-zora-neale-hurston-last-slave-ship-survivor-book-life-story-published-a8335776.html) died in 1935 at the age of 94-95 and is believed to have been the last survivor of the transatlantic slave trade, having come to the US in 1860 on the last slave boat.  Another person who was on that boat, [Sally Redoshi](https://www.history.com/news/last-slave-ship-survivor-redoshi-clotilda), lived till 1937 and had been a 12 year old in 1860. 


What can we draw from these examples?  


In 1954-55 when Martin Luther King Junior rose to prominence in the civil rights movement and led the montgomery bus boycott. The last documented slave had died four years previously.     

We can reasonably assume that there are some individuals who were born  as slaves in the late 1850's up through the early 1860's and emancipated as children, and were ""undocumented"" as it were.   But these people would have had virtually no memory of being slaves, and would have been 95-100+ at the time MLK first became a public figure.   

How many are possible?  

[According to US Census data](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-09.pdf)   .08 percent of the US population is between 95-99, and .1 is 100 or older.  So we can very roughly assume that even in the modern era, 1/1000 people live to be centenarians.  This is the deep end of the gene pool. 

  In the 1860 census there were 3.9 million slaves. If we make a ridiculously generous assumption and say that 1/1000 would live to 100, that means as of 1960, the top end for surviving slaves would have been something on the order of 3900 people spread across the entire US south. really, that's way off because the 3.9 mil is ALL slaves from 0-the oldest living slave at the time, and we're looking at only a tiny percent of slaves to begin with. Realistically, it was probably hugely less than that.  Dozens if not single digits. 

In any case, most of these people would have had zero memory of being slaves themselves, having only been 4-5 when the civil war ended."

I have a couple of earlier answers related to medieval depictions of hell before Dante. They both describe how post-1000 depictions of hell are firmly rooted in very early Christian texts--the Apocalypse of Peter, Gospel of Nicodemus, and so forth:

For what it's worth, my answer about Satan as the ruler of hell is one of my all-time favorites.

I hope these are helpful!"
740,AskHistorians,"Since WWII, nazi iconography has been symbolic of evil and villainy in western culture - especially in entertainment. What was the iconography of evil in culture before the nazis?","In western culture, there is loads of imagery from the Bible--Babylon, Jezebel, serpents, the colors red and black. I want to focus, however, on two broader themes.

*Part I: Monsters*

We live in an age where you can buy a [cuddly Cthulhu](https://imgur.com/a/nFwc8jw)--a [cuddly *pink* Cthulhu](https://imgur.com/a/QEYuhuD)--a [cuddly Cthulhu *with a children's book*](https://imgur.com/a/DHrhSXb)--so I think we tend to lose sight of the, well, monstrosity of creature-type monsters (as opposed to the human variety).

But monsters were the code that the authors of apocalyptic tracts used to portray enemies and oppressors:

> Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea.

> ...There before me was a fourth beast—terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.

> While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully.

> ...The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.

In Revelation, John does give us four ordinary people on horses. But he picks up the beast theme of Daniel 7 to describe Rome, this time:

> I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.

And more to the point for present purposes, the beast in Revelation doesn't just represent evil. It's also used to make otherwise-mundane imagery become evil:

> There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls.

(This is, of course, also a case of Babylon being used to highlight Rome as evil.)

Medieval iconography is also keen on monsters illustrating evil. We're more used to the [Paradise Lost](https://imgur.com/a/EYC3RVj) Satan and his heirs (looking at you, *Lucifer*). For medieval Christians, demons and the devil were monsters. The nuns at the Rupertsberg [illuminated the Antichrist](https://www.medievalists.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Hildegard_Bingen_Scivias_214v_Five_Ages_Antichrist.jpg), for example--the Antichrist, who most legends would make out to be a human being, yeah? We're also got plenty of [devilish monsters](http://ica.themorgan.org/icaimages/1/m153.019ra.jpg) on hand.

But devil iconography brings me to the second topic I want to look at--one I am not happy about, at all.

*Part 2: ""The Jews""*

Yes, the comparison here is to the 21st century use of [Nazi](https://youtu.be/EC9Pkz9dPMU?t=185) [imagery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yys5iioLUNw), so this doubly or triply sucks.

But it's another case of associating something with The Jews to mark it as bad.

To be clear, I don't mean Jewish people/people who happen to be Jewish. (No, they just get to suffer the consequences.) I mean ""The Jews"": the racist European-American Christian *invention* of a cabal that...well, whatever they're doing, it's evil.

First, iconography.

To the 12th century, illustrations of Jewish men generally [denote them by hat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/GermanJews1.jpg) (from Herrad von Hohenburg's *Hortus deliciarum*, which sadly means Garden of Delights instead of Garden of Delicious Things). But as ideas of a Jewish ""race"" started to coalesce, Christian artists evolved the stereotype of the [""Jewish"" nose](https://imgur.com/a/IGCoELo).

By the late Middle Ages, [Satan and demons are depicted with ""Jewish"" iconographical features](https://imgur.com/a/YIUGo2J). Yes, mixed in with monstrosity. Association with The Jews makes the *devil* appear more evil--not the other way around.

Early modern witch hysteria gives us another example. In point of fact, witchcraft is usually an accusation levelled against Christians. But that doesn't stop artists from [adopting ""Jewish"" features to signal that a person is a witch](https://www.medievalists.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Pagan-Traces-in-Medieval-and-Early-Modern-European-Witch-beliefs.jpg).

Second, conspiracy.

20th century American conservatism (20-year-rule, people) has a very, very strong anti-internationalist streak that draws on anti-Semitic associations at nearly every turn. The slight scuzziness you probably sense around the edges (or not so edges) of the phrase ""international banker,"" for example, doesn't go back to Banker being the profession that gives you the most money setting out in *Oregon Trail II*. 

For paleoconservatives' long-running fear about the US losing national sovereignty (no, really), they adopted The Jews as a quick and dirty way to express *just how evil* the people threatening to take over were. (The association of Jews and banking also goes back to the Middle Ages).

And in the early 20th century, at least, you had Jewish bankers...and then also, you had--in the words of conservative evangelical and fundamentalist Christians--""Jewish Communists."" Because ""The Jews"" were even used to make Communism seem more evil.

This didn't stop with World War II, either. Henry Ford might have distributed copies of *Protocols of the Elders of Zion* in the 1920s, but Mary Davison wrote *Profound Revolution* in 1960. And in the abominable *Left Behind* books, not only do they even turn their Rockefeller expy into a Jewish man, but they make him responsible not just for the new world order, but for their Antichrist.

Obviously there's a lot more to be said about the history of anti-Semitism, and Christian fantasies of Jewish association with evil and the devil. I've tried to concentrate here on examples of Jewish stereotypes used to make other things seem more evil, rather than just negative stereotypes in and of themselves."
741,AskHistorians,"Why didn't Saudi Arabia claim the title of Caliph, considering that they own the Two Holy Cities, and have significant economic, military and political clout?","A Caliph is an individual able to command the respect of the Muslim community.  As such, the theological differences between Saudi's Salafi Islam and other Sunni sects created a non-trivial obstacle to reconciliation.

The Kingdom of Hejaz had the authority to make such a claim, given the legitimacy of the Hashemite dynasty.  As you may be aware, they were the custodians of Mecca and Medina for a thousand years, and to this day have a reputation for good character.  Jordan is still ruled by the Hashemite dynasty, and is known for accepting huge numbers of refugees from neighbouring Arab countries during times of crisis.

While it may be tempting to assume that the Muslim heartland is just Arabia, this is not true.  Jerusalem is the third holiest city in Islam, a region Saudi Arabia never controlled.  Jerusalem is regarded with great fondness by most Muslims, and the al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock in the old city are sacred places.  Similarly, many places in Syria and Egypt have great cultural and historical significance for Muslims.  Damascus was the capital of previous Caliphates, and has long been a centre of Islamic learning.

To be recognised as a legitimate Caliph, in the traditional sense of unifying Muslims in their heartland, one really has to influence Palestine, Syria, and Arabia.  Saudi has never done that, while preceding Caliphates have.  The fractured state of the Middle East after the fall of the Ottoman Empire meant that nobody has been in a position to invoke the title with much seriousness.

One should understand that while the Hashemites claimed the title in the 1920s, during that era the region was in a state of flux.  It was possible that a Hashemite dynasty could have assembled a successor state from the ashes of the Ottomans.  But this did not happen.

During the First World War letters were exchanged between Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, and Lieutenant Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, British High Commissioner to Egypt.  The boundaries discussed would essentially have included most of Arabia, Iraq, Syria, and Palestine.  In that case the Hashemite dynasty could have legitimately claimed to be a Caliphate.  But the British government had made various promises to various parties in order to acquire as much support for the war as possible, and as such did not honour their negotiations with Hussein, who became King of Hejaz instead.

The Hashemites not only have Meccan pedigree, but they also briefly controlled East Jerusalem and the West Bank in Palestine in the aftermath of the first Arab-Israeli war.

Saudi Arabia could have claimed to be the Caliphate if their power extended to unify the Muslim heartland: inclusive of Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Egypt.  But though the House of Saud is undoubtedly super rich, they have never been powerful enough to force the issue.  Even if they did, their dynasty does not have the legitimacy of the Hashemites.

In conclusion, many have claimed to be a Caliph, but in order to become the Caliph you must unify the Islamic heartland; which is far more than just Mecca and Medina.  Saudi Arabia has never been able to do this, and has never claimed this as its intention either."
742,AskHistorians,"In Brazil, pretty much no one acknowledges the Wright brothers invented the airplane. Most say it was Santos Dumont who did. Was that really the case?","Santos Dumont's first flight of a powered heavier than air plane [was in 1906](https://www.aiaa.org/SecondaryTwoColumn.aspx?id=15163). The Wright Brothers were in 1903-1905.  

People had been flying for many years before this. Balloons and gliders were well known and in widespread use. What no one had done before then was to fly a heavier than air plane in a controlled, sustained, flight. This is different from just 'hopping' where you only attain flight for a very short period of time. Some people discount the 1903 Wright Brothers flights as 'hopping' since the longest only 59 seconds and they had the advantage of strong winds. However, b[y 1904 they had flown in a circle for the first time](http://www.wright-brothers.org/Information_Desk/Just_the_Facts/Airplanes/Wright_Airplanes.htm) in history and by 1905 they were flying for over half an hour at a time. That is clearly powered, controlled, flight.  

Dumont's first flights in 1906 were much like the Wrights first flights. Short, straight flights that lasted for under a minute. However, by 1907 he [had built a plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos-Dumont_Demoiselle) that was clearly capable of sustained controlled flight. 

What the ""Dumont First"" proponents often allege is that because the Wright Brothers[ used a launch rail their flight does not count](http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/12/10/brazil.santosdumont.reut/). Dumont's plane took off using it's own wheels. The Wrights did not [add wheels until 1910](http://www.wright-brothers.org/Information_Desk/Just_the_Facts/Airplanes/Model_B.htm). 

Personally, I don't think it matters much who was first. They both basically developed their crafts on their own and each made contributions to the future of air travel and each was building on the backs of people who came before them. 

Scientific American has a [pretty good run down](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientific-american-debunks-claim-gustave-whitehead-was-first-in-flight/) of the different claims for First Flight if you're looking for more info.

743,AskHistorians,How did Joan of Arc -- an illiterate 16 year old woman -- convince an army to follow her?,"With much thanks to /u/Pytheastic ([go upvote!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/bxi6a9/how_did_joan_of_arc_an_illiterate_16_year_old/eq77j97/)), I'd like to write an answer more focused on this specific question. :)

The simple answer is that Joan had the support of the king, but that's pretty much running a shell company on my part. If I had to sum things up, I would say ""religion and prophecy,"" but that also is not very interesting in and of itself.

**Joan as Holy Woman**

From Joan's own testimony at her trial, it is easily apparent that she was deeply immersed in the religious culture of her time. The saints most important to her are the most popular ones, she's right with the new trend in angels, she's sold on the rising importance of devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus.

This is important because Joan fits firmly in the context of the early 15th century as a holy woman and prophet. Her visions and auditions anchor her in a tradition going back to the mid-12th century of women who used the message that they spoke and acted based on direct revelation from God. 

In Joan's time, *some* people are starting to question the validity of holy women's claims. The initial questions themselves, though in some ways the culmination of a longer trend, are highly political as a result of the Avignon papacy and (especially) the Great Schism (ca1378-1415). In other words, they are very much tied to ecclesiastical politics.

On the ground level, what we find is much more ongoing confidence in women's revelations. 14th century saints and visionaries Catherine of Siena and especially Birgitta of Sweden are *all the rage*. People even start attributing to Birgitta texts that she didn't write; she's that famous and popular even among the literate classes. Birgitta (and Pseudo-Birgitta) becomes especially well-known for two things that transcend the literacy barrier: prophecy and a set of prayers.

Not everyone, but a whole lot of people, took Joan absolutely seriously as conveying divine messages directly. In very particular, Charles VII was raised in an environment where his parents firmly believed in the prophetic powers of holy women. Charles VI had given audience to Jeanne-Marie de Maillé; and Isabeau, to Marie Robine (a peasant, by the way). 

And this was, of course, the key issue at her initial and nullification (rehabilitation) trials: were Joan's fake or real; demonic or divine...according to the political beliefs of the judge or witness. For a demonstration, turn to no less a contemporary authority than French ""theologian &c"" Jean Gerson (uh...he was Really Important; roll with it), who is infamously on the record as opposing the legitimacy of holy women...but wrote dramatically in support of Joan.

**Joan and Wonders**

Kelly DeVries, who is basically *the* authority on Joan as a soldier and commander, stresses the importance of religion in the accounts of Joan's contemporary supporters as well as her own (*Joan of Arc: A Military Leader*, but especially ""A Woman as a Leader of Men"" in *Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc*, which is, well, about this question's precise topic). He's right, although his account is based on Joan's full career, including her victories. Which, again, is a liiiittle bit of a cop-out.

I want to go back to the 15th century mindset again, to look at the overall supernatural cosmology of the era. Well into the early modern era, there's no real divide between what we would call ""religion"" and ""magic."" (Indeed, ""religion"" doesn't even have our meaning until the 15th century.) As with belief in revelations from God, people live in a world of wonders and miracles and saints and supernatural creatures. But as seen with growing concern with witchcraft and questions about holy women's sincerity, the boundaries are just starting to be sketched out by some people.

This is especially apparent in Joan's case. The wonders associated with her don't really have a division in what she relates about other people's support of her. They *do* have a divide in the mindset of her interrogators--and, because Joan is frakking *awesome*, she knows exactly what they're doing and keeps pace. (Seriously, read Dan Hobbins' translation *The Trial of Joan of Arc*. She's great.)

A big one is Joan's knowledge of and then the discovery of ""her sword"" in a church dedicated to one of France's most important saints. The finding of a blessed object has major precursors in the Middle Ages, especially associated with the Crusades. In the 15th century, that was more important than ever. The *physical reality* of objects was critical to how people saw the world and religion in a way it wasn't earlier. Second, the cult of relics and saints was, you guessed it, critical in a way it hadn't been earlier. (Think of Mark Twain's remark about there being more shards of the Holy Cross in the world--in the 19th century still!--than there could have been in the actual cross.)

According to Joan herself, people also told stories about a prophecy they associated with her and a tree/forest near her home in Domremy. But in her own words, what people said to her about this was just linked to her performing wonders. This probably included a miraculous power to heal, which was also heavily tied to holy women/living saints in late Middle Ages. (There are stories about men, women, and children all trying to touch Joan, which seems suspiciously, I don't know, *biblical*. And yes, at a time when there was much more preaching of the Bible directly.) 

The tree was associated with fairies and local children performed May Crowning-type playing/ritual activities around it, although Joan insists she never believed any of it and never engaged in a lot of the behaviors her judges asked her about. Of course, they lie WILDLY when they write up the articles of condemnation. On one hand, they say Joan admitted to various things when she categorically had not. On the other, though, they exaggerate the various behaviors and beliefs they had asked her about earlier. And, unsurprisingly, they exaggerate according to particular patterns that align with the question of fake or real, demonic or divine.

So people associated Joan with the general performance of miracles and wonders.

**Hans Böhm**

Okay, obviously a man, obviously German, and not obviously a few decades after Joan. However, Böhm is a crucial parallel for a few reasons. Even venturing further into the very slowly increasing fear of witches, Böhm--a shepherd from Baden-Württemberg--essentially launched an entire revolt against unjust conditions based on his own prophecies and visions of Mary.

People were ready to heed prophecy that called to them--and did.

**Conclusion**

Joan was awesome; she promoted her awesomeness; she did so in a way that grew out of the religious culture in which she lived and believed."
744,AskHistorians,I am a governor of a village at the height of Genghis Khan's empire. What should I expect to happen after I submit peacefully to Mongol rule?,"You're right, the ""most correct"" answer is **""it depends.""** But, let's sort through some hypotheticals... you mention that you're a governor, meaning that your town must be significant enough to warrant having one, and therefore probably has enough in the way of defenses to potentially make it annoying and costly to capture. You say you're surrendering peacefully - let's presume that mean that essentially the Mongols say ""Hello, we're here, now submit."" And your response is to immediately throw open the city gates and reply, ""I thought you'd never ask, come in for some tea!"" And finally, let's just go ahead and assume that you are not personally responsible for whatever reason the Mongols went to war against your kingdom in the first place.

You and your city are, more likely than not, going to be fine. You will face a tribute payment, yes. But especially if you're one of the ""early birds"" who crosses over before it has become ""bleedingly obvious"" that your kingdom is going to be on the losing side - and *especially* if you can get some of your kinsmen already on the Mongol side to vouch for you - you might be looking at fairly low levels of relative taxation. Let's take a look at a case study - the Mongol conquest of Khwarazmia:

# Background

The Empire of Khwarazm existed across much of Persia, extending from the mountains of Aghanistan and Uzbekistan to the shores of the Black Sea, and including Transoxiana, Ferghana, Sistan, Khurasan, and Iraq-Ajemi. It was, in a word, *huge*. It was also a very young empire - having been won and formed in 1200 CE, it was only \~6 years older, in fact, than the Great Mongol Nation (*Yeke Mongol Ulus)* forged by Genghis Khan in 1206. In fact, across much of the first two decades of the 13th century, it was still far from a settled affair, and major fighting had only stopped in many of the regions as late as ca. 1215. As such the ruler of this Turko-Persian empire - variously styled as the Amir/Sultan, and self-styled the Shah (though the caliph in Baghdad rejected this presumption) - was every bit the brash conqueror-king with delusions of grandeur.

&#x200B;

The Mongol and Kwarazmian forces came to learn about one another existance right about this same time - the mid-1210's, albeit via radically differing means. The Amir of Kwarazm, having learned of a ""Golden Empire"" that he'd known as *Kitay*, far to the East that was wealthy beyond reckoning. Thus he dispatched an embassy/trade mission to go see what was up - since his men had informed him that there were disturbances in the region that threatened to undermine the lucrative supply of trade goods that transited his own territories. What they found after months of travel and entering the plain approaching the Central Capital of Jin, Zhongdu (mod. Beijing) was devastation beyond reckoning - a city so large as they'd never imagined with 40 foot high walls encompassing a region of more than 15 miles laid to absolute waste. The bleached, rotting bones of the city's dead stacked and strewn across the landscape in such great number that, at first, some in the party had mistaken the first sighting of whiteness coving the ground as an unseasonable snowfall... until the smell hit them. That was the first encounter of the Khwarazmians with the Mongols, or at least their handiwork.

For the Mongols of Genghis, it was a significantly less amazing affair. Having made war of the Kara-Khitan kingdom (AKA W. Liao), that had been usurped by an old enemy of the Great Khan - a Naiman called Guchlug - the Mongol pursue their defeated foe across the border and into Khwarazm territory, and they'd taken careful note of what they found. Genghis was greatly interested - a powerful state, and one far enough away to not pose an immediate threat, whose rulers had given him no cause for vengeance - in other words: a potential trading partner for the Silk Road goods he now controlled one terminus of.

After a round of negotiations, a deal was struck, and the Great Khan dispatched a vast caravan loaded with every manner of luxury - camel furs, silks, gold, silver, tea... you name it. And some 450-500 merchants and traders loyal to the Mongols, though primarily Muslim, and foreran by an Indian emissary bearing a letter of friendship to Amir Ala al-Din Muhammad II:

>​I have the greatest desire to live in peace with you. I shall look on you as my son. For your part, you are not unaware that I have conquered North China and subject all the tribes of the north. You know that my country is an ant heap of warriors, a mine of silver, and that I have no need to covet other dominions. We have an equal interest in fostering trade between our subjects. \[... I invite trade between our two peoples so that\] henceforth the abscess of evil thoughts may be lanced by the improvement of relations and agreement between us, and the pus of sedition and rebellion removed.

It was not, however, to be. Fatefully, the Mongol caravan’s route passed through the Khwarazmian province of Syr Darya, and its regional capital Otrar. The governor of Otrar was Inalchuq, a relation of Amir Muhammad’s mother. It was he who stopped the caravan’s procession and, after meeting with their ambassador and the othe heads of the group, order them all detained. The stated reason was that one of their number – a man Inalchuq had known previously – had supposedly addressed the Governor without his title, Ghayir-Khan. It would become quickly obvious, however, that this was little more than a convenient excuse, and that the governor in fact simply meant to seize the caravan’s rich cargo for himself. Upon taking the Mongol caravan captive, Inalchuq send a message to his Amir, telling him that he had captured a host of Mongol spies, and proposing their immediate execution. Whether because he actually believed his governor’s accusations, or – rather more likely – that he saw this as a chance to seize the goods for himself without need to pay it back, the Amir agreed to the execution of the entire party, and that the stolen goods be taken to Bukhara and sold.

In spite of this egregious offense – the killing of a Mongol ambassador was one of the most serious possible offenses, as was the theft of the Khan’s goods – Genghis as yet was willing to make a final attempt to avoid all-out war. A new embassy was sent to the Khwarazmian capital, this time consisting only of one Muslim and two Mongols to demand an explanation from Amir Muhammad for this egregious breach of international etiquette. Perhaps, after all, the Amir was blameless, and the blood lay on the offending governor’s hands alone. If that were the case, the ambassadors demanded, Muhammad must turn over the governor of Otrar to them in chains, to be taken back to Mongolia and face the Khan’s justice. At this, Muhammad balked – he would do no such thing, and the fact that these three foreigners had the audacity to stand before him making such demands was an insult to his station and power. Especially insulting to him was the fact that the lead ambassador was a Muslim – like himself – yet paid his service and loyalty to this heretical barbarian king. Muhammad II’s response was swift and damning: the Muslim ambassador was executed on the spot, and the two Mongols were instructed to ride back to Mongolia and inform their king that if he wanted his treasure back so badly, he’d have to come and take it, if he could. Yet before they were allowed to leave with their lives, the Amir had their beards shaved off – a sign of extreme humiliation – and the executed ambassador’s head sent with them in a box. All this was in 1218... the Mongols rode out for Khwarazm in early 1219. They'd arrive that autumn.

From the Secret History of the Mongols:

>\[Genghis\] rode past the settlement of Alai, taking with him his Merkid wife Khulan Khatun as companion, and leaving his brother Ochigin in command of the Great Camp at Avarga. The first army he sent out was commanded by Jebe, behind them he sent another led by Subedei, and behind them a third under Tokhuchar. Sending off these three commanders he told them: ‘Ride off to the outside of the Sultan’s armies and wait them until I arrive. Then you’ll attack from your side when I strike from mine.’

Though at first the Mongol armies rode past Kwarazmian cities without stopping or attacking, their mere presence had the – perhaps foreknown and intentional – effect of breaking most of the populace’s will to put up any resistance.  In droves, the populations fled to the Mongol lines to submit, and bringing with them yet further information about the fracture-points within the military and political situation of the enemy empire. Elsewise, they fled in the opposite direction – toward the nearest great city of the region: Bukhara. As far as the Mongol commanders were concerned, that was actually the better outcome. Just as they had done to the Jin Empire in the east, they now used terror as a means to stretch the supply limits of this sedentary society to, and then past, its breaking point. If they would hide behind their walls, as the Jurchen had done and as these Persians surely would as well… well, then best to fill those walls to the brim with useless mouths and grasping hands. Better to deplete the cities’ supplies and pillage their fars well ahead of the first mongol arriving at the city gates. The border towns under the command of Amin al-Mulk were thus taken and plundered, and the governor himself fled to the prince Jalal al-Din in an attempt to bolster each other’s forces against the Mongol advance.

OK... so now having established the relevant groundwork, let's get into the meat of your question..."
745,AskHistorians,Why are the French so good at protesting?,"To put it simply, the French - and particularly the people of Paris - have a long history of political protest, born out of conditions that made protest (as well as rioting, looting, and mass violence) both necessary and effective. 

Prior to the Revolution of 1789, the main form of protest in France (urban and rural) was the subsistence riot. Food insecurity was rampant in early modern France: until the early 18th century, every few decades a major famine would arise that killed off hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of people - at a time when the entire population of France was around 20 million. The last of these occurred in the winter of 1709-1710, killing around 600,000 people (3% of the population). These crises were generally triggered by abnormal weather events leading to bad harvests, but exacerbated by mismanagement of resources, and of course by wealth inequality. Grain shortages led to high prices; high prices meant that the majority of the working population, who already spent a significant portion of their income (as much as 50%) on bread, couldn't afford to eat. So, of course, people rioted. 

Subsistence riots were generally based on the notion that there was a fair price for grain, and that it was the responsibility of the king (and his proxies) to enforce that fair price. This wasn't incorrect: there was no free market in grain in the early modern period (experiments in free trade e.g. in 1774-75 didn't end well), and provisioning was legally the king's responsibility. Shortages and high prices were thus interpreted as a failure of royal authority, forcing the people to take things into their own hands. While looting did occur during these riots, it was less common than what is called ""price fixing"": taking goods in exchange for what the crowd determined to be a fair price. So while these protests were a survival tactic, they were also explicitly political: they were responding to a perceived failure of the government to do its job by taking that authority (distributing grain, setting prices) into their own hands. 

The subsistence riot was both a rural and an urban phenomenon, and was the primary form of political protest in rural areas anytime supplies were low and prices were high. While subsistence riots did occur in urban areas, city-dwellers - and especially Parisians - were not limited to a single form of political protest. They learned early on that they had numbers on their side, and that they could leverage the power of massive crowds to achieve specific political goals. These goals were varied, by they generally involved supporting one governmental faction over another - e.g. the Parlement of Paris against the royal ministries. While France may have been an absolute monarchy, Paris was a mishmash of jurisdictions with overlapping claims to authority - in which the ability to mobilize the crowd was often more important than traditional claims to authority. In the 1770s, people rioted in support of the Parlement - which led to the old Parlement being restored. In 1789, the popular finance minister Necker was dismissed, and the people rioted to have him reinstated - you know the rest. 

The people of Paris had numbers on their side: in the eighteenth century, Paris was one of the largest cities in the world, with between 500,000 and 1 million people. Those numbers are vague not only because of the lack of a formal census, but because a large chunk of the population didn't reside in the city permanently: people came and went, looking for work as day-labourers or servants, often resorting to begging when there was no work to be found. These people had little to lose and were hard to identify, given their lack of ties to their neighbourhoods, so they made excellent rioters. 

Additionally, eighteenth-century Paris had fairly high literacy rates, making it easy for rioters to share their grievances and coordinate with one another. Hand-written placards were posted all over the city at any given time: some advertising goods and services, some sharing conspiracy theories (the ever popular ""famine plot""), some making threats to the police, and so on. The police performed extensive surveillance in the hopes of preventing these protests, but ultimately they were massively outnumbered, and their reach was limited. Their rank and file were also not opposed to joining the rioters' side when it suited them - this was what happened in 1789, leading to a total breakdown in police authority. 

Essentially, by the time the Revolution came, the French - particularly within Paris, but outside of it as well - had a long tradition of violent, coordinated political protest. Moreover, over the course of the eighteenth century that tradition had modernized; it had mobilized to serve more diverse political ends than subsistence, and begun to adopt the language of nationhood and individual rights popularized by the Enlightenment. This combined with the poor harvests and political upheaval of the late 1780s to create the Revolutionary moment, but it didn't end there, as we have seen. 

Now I'm obviously an early modernist and can't speak much to the post-1800 world, but I do nevertheless see a common thread linking the popular uprisings of the Old Regime to those of the nineteenth and twentieth (and now twenty-first) centuries. Even under the most repressive of governments (monarchists don't @ me) the French people had a keen sense of what they were owed, and were willing to take it by force if necessary. Over the years they developed and refined their tactics for doing so, using whatever tools were at their disposal - the written word, the urban environment (cobblestones make great projectiles!), the sympathy of local authorities. 

Moreover - and I'm not as informed about this so maybe someone with a background in modern history can chime in - in modern era, participation in protest movements has become something of a rite of passage for French youth. While popular protest is generally a working-class phenomenon, among students and youth the class dynamics are a bit different. Young people protest not just against their oppressors but against the idea that they must necessarily become oppressors themselves - a phenomenon most evident in 1968 but present earlier and later as well. Young people will pretty much come out to protest no matter what - because they believe in the cause, of course, but also because that's what young French people do; it's part of their culture.

746,AskHistorians,Where would a middle or upper class black person store their wealth during the early 20th century. Were banks segregated? Could my money go “missing”?,"Segregation of banks would, of course, depend on the laws of the state you were in, but even outside of the regions that existed under the apartheid regime of Jim Crow, the early 20th century is notable for being the point when African-American banking began to take form. Legal segregation may not have existed, but common beliefs that African-Americans had no assets meant that few financial institutions had any interest in catering to them. Focusing on Chicago, for instance, in 1900, there were only seven African-Americans who identified themselves on the US Census as 'bankers', and no banks which were considered 'black' but over the next few decades that began to change.

The First Binga Bank was established in 1908 by Jesse Binga. He was a wealthy African-American realtor who had the personal financial assets to essentially create a bank out of thin air. Rumor plagued him about the real source of his wealth, as his wife was the sister of a notorious gambler, John V. Johnson, but Binga was a self-made man who had made smart investments in land and property, and settled in Chicago, home to a fast growing black community. His bank wasn't specifically aimed at catering to the black community, and in fact the majority of his customers were white, but it was nevertheless an important step, both in the *equal* treatment of black customers, and the simple presence of black-owned financial institutions within the black community.

He would see several more branches open up, and although the first black bank in Chicago, he was quickly followed by a several more including R.W. Hunter & Co. Bank and A.W. Woodfolk Bank. These institutions provided openings into finance that had been cut off to black persons, and also brought in stability to those communities. R.W. Hunter, in his promotion of his own company, proudly proclaimed it to be ""a substantial enterprise, owned, controlled and actively managed by Colored men and women [that] has developed into an important asset of Chicago.""

Back before the FDIC, banking - of any color - wasn't always a guarantee in those days though, although the racial aspect certainly brought in further dangers. The R.W. Hunter Bank had expanded quickly, but then started to suffer and was floated by a loan from the A.W. Woodfolk Bank, which didn't prevent it from going bankrupt. The Woodfolk Bank, in turn, was a target during the 1919 Race Riots in the city, which saw one of its properties firebombed. The resulting run on the bank from frightened investors and depositors shutting it down, although it ended up in receivership, not total closure, under P.W. Chavers, who continued the commitment to ""serve African Americans in such a matter as to instill greater confidence in black banks and bankers, produce progress for his race, and accumulate wealth for himself and his family."" 

Binga's Bank would survive longer, but as with many institutions worldwide, couldn't make it through the 1929 Crash and ensuing depression. The 1920s would also see the biggest advancement, under the leadership of Chavers, with the accrediting of the Douglass National Bank, which was the first African-American bank to be nationally chartered, allowing it to put into circulation US banknotes with the signature of the bank President, Anthony Overton, a source of immense pride within the community at the time. It too, though, would fall victim to the Depression, clawing through for a few more years before closing up shop in 1932.

So anyways, to wrap things up, the early 1900s saw a rise of black banking, not just in Chicago, although that was the focus here. Wealthy African-Americans were able to put up the capital to begin these institutions, and they provided banking colorblind services, as well as employment opportunity in finance, both things which white-owned institutions generally failed to do. The institutions were honest, as any other bank, at the least, but they suffered from the instability of banking prior to the FDIC, and a number of them went under; in some cases as a direct result of racial animus, and in others from the simple mundane sort of failures that can impact any bank. While they existed through, they were an important backbone of the African-American community, not only providing deposit and investment opportunities to black persons of Chicago, but also an important point of community pride and stability.

747,AskHistorians,"Were there Americans who pushed back against sacrifices the average citizen were forced to make during WW2 (ration books, limits on gas, ECT.) In the same vain that we are seeing today with measures taken to combat Covid-19?","I can't answer for Americans, but I can for British: some absolutely were.

People generally complied with the letter of the law, with some black-market activity, but would often skirt its spirit. Expensive restaurants didn't need ration cards at the start of the war, it was possible to be sent care packages from relatives abroad, and wealthy housewives had a much easier time skirting the labour-board mandates of 1941 than poorer women. Bear in mind that, as of Dec 1941, women under 50 were (in theory) conscripted into some form of war work. In general, wealthy housewives were able to get out of working or volunteering outside the home for more than a few hours a week, and some were even able to keep employing servants. The party season was severely curtailed for the upper and upper-middle classes, but New Year's 1942 still featured a gala at Grosvenor House that apparently would not have looked very out of place aside from meager portion sizes pre-war.

There were also a number of sacrifices that, while in theory were equal, affected groups very differently. Clothes rationing was hard on everybody, but Utility garments tended to wear out much faster than more expensive ones, which meant the poor tended to go through their ration cards faster.

Mass Observation diarist #5427 specifically mentioned that she was considering getting her car retrofitted to use a different kind of fuel, costing the equivalent of $6,000 today, *just* to get around the gas restrictions; unfortunately for her, the gas restrictions came with a ban on most types of non-essential driving, so she dropped the idea.

Finally, many of the restrictions, like with COVID, were only recommendations and not law. There were recommendations, at least in the winters of 1941-2 and 1942-3, to use minimal fuel to heat fires in houses. Some people delayed heating their homes in October for weeks longer than others, and some continued to heat multiple rooms (central heating was pretty rare - rooms were heated individually) during the winter.

The biggest example of a recommendation that failed was the evacuation of children. Millions of children were evacuated from the cities into the countryside early in the war, but it generally went poorly. Urban (mostly poor) children suffered severe culture shock and often just wanted to return home, and parents often wound up wanting to take their children back. Most children gradually found their way back home within a few months or a year, and did not re-evacuate when air raids started.

748,AskHistorians,How can we attract more Historians/researchers of lesser known/niche subjects to this kickass sub-reddit so that we have more answers to questions asked?,"Funnily enough, the problem is actually the opposite. We have a bunch of fantastic flairs in all sorts of niche topics ([check out our range!](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/flairedusers)), but many of them tell us that they never get any questions in their field and are losing interest in the sub. Meanwhile, a few flairs in the most popular subject areas (Ancient Greece and Rome, Medieval Europe, WW2) don't have enough time in their day to answer all the questions they get. 

And then there's a couple of really mainstream and obvious fields that get loads of questions (US presidents, US labour history, 20th century US history), but for some reason we haven't been able to attract or hold on to our flairs in those areas. We have a system to alert flairs of questions in their area of expertise, but for some questions that rise to the top, we know they're just not going to get a good answer.

749,AskHistorians,"The United States Second Amendment starts with ""A well-regulated militia..."". What was intended by the phrase ""well-regulated"" if the right extends to gun owners who are not part of an organised group?","This is both an important question, and, as many other respondents have noted, also a thorny one.  While I appreciate the citation of Heller as a strong indication of modern interpretations of the history of the phrase “well-regulated militia” as seen through legal eyes, both the controlling and dissenting opinions have found dissent.  Since much of the origin of that dissent falls outside of the historical realm (and long discussion of it would violate our 20 year rule), I’d rather leave that for now and look to some historian’s interpretations, and see if that helps illuminate your question.  

(Apparently I was had typed this up this morning that comment may have been removed for that reason, so sorry if I am responding to a phantom post now)

Just as a caveat, though: Clearly this is a question that has sharp divides, and the context of the way the question is framed today might itself be seen as ahistorical.

As noted above, there is a well-established concern that a militia stood in contrast to a Standing Army, which was seen as the “tool of a tyrant.”  But one of the ways to answer this question about the militia specifically is to examine the historical context of what constituted a militia (and here I am focusing on the period before the Revolution) versus what did not at the time, since colonials did react to armed citizens taking up “defense” differently in different contexts.

In general, for a militia to be “well-regulated” it would have to have been mustered out by colonial authority, specifically the colonial Governor.  Other groups that owned individual weapons and “mustered out” on their own – even if was regional and massively popular – were seen not as proper militias but as illegal actors or vigilantes.  On the eve of the American Revolution in South Carolina, there was a set of vigilante groups in the western backcountry that eschewed the courts and decided to muster themselves out and attack outlaw gangs.  This “Regulator Conflict” of 1767 was not seen as a proper use of militia but instead as a criminal activity, although people in the Western backcountry saw it as simply a necessity due to lack of governmental protection afforded to people by the governments along the coast.  (I should note that western backcountry uprisings and “taking law into their own hands” is a subject worthy of an entirely other thread, one can go back to Bacon’s Rebellion as an example.) The eerie parallel is that the regulator conflicts presaged some of the complaints American Revolutionaries would have after the implementation of smuggling offenses being tried in the military Vice-Admiralty Courts – there were too few courts, too far away, although in some ways the complaints were polar opposites – the backcountry decried the lack of convictions of criminals, whereas the Vice Admiralty Courts were seen as tools of oppression, placing colonials who (in the colonials minds) were doing minor civilian infractions being sent to military Tribunals.

So not every group of citizens arming themselves and engaging in “defense” was seen as well-organized.  Also, some historians have argued there is evidence in the early Republic that the second amendment was not seen as an individual right.  I am specifically thinking of an essay in the collection edited by Saul Cornell, Whose Right to Bear Arms Did the Second Amendment Protect? – and I apologize as I do not have the book on hand and a quick google search didn’t help me find the list of essays, but I’ll come back later and append if there is interest – but one of the early essays in the book cited the example of George Washington’s experience with the Whiskey Rebellion – not only, as mentioned in a previous response, drummed out the militia to deal with the uprising, but he also ordered disarmament of the Rebels.  Therefore, the author concluded, the second amendment was not was not intended to reach beyond the militia mustered by the government.  However, the point of that text was also to show other historians who had differing interpretations as well.  It’s a good resource to examine some of the historiography of the debate.  One of the co-editors, Cornell, is famous for making an argument that the two legal methods of viewing the second amendment (individual or collective) are both not quite right, and there is a third view entirely.  Since I have not read his book on the matter – only an abstract and reviews – I cannot comment on its veracity, but as he is a rather esteemed scholar on this debate you may find it of interest as to how the framing of the debate today may be in and of itself flawed when we ask these questions.

However, one needs caution.  I want to point out that some historical books need to be avoided.  I myself was influenced at one time by a book that was highly lauded but ended up being upended.  One of our great modern scandals involving the Bancroft Prize happened when in Emory professor Michael Bellesiles published Arming America, which tried to argue that the American value of gun ownership was more a locus of Pre-Civil War America and not a phenomena rooted in colonial, Revolutionary, or Early National America.  As a new Assistant Professor, I personally tailored some of my lectures around what was seen then as groundbreaking new scholarship.  As you might guess, it ended up that the book was an embarrassment – indeed, a lot of the evidence was simply fabricated – and it led to the Bancroft Prize being rescinded.  (I think this is the only time that has happened.)

One other area worthy of investigation is to recognize that the idea of what constitutes a militia evolves as well over time in America.  Since this goes beyond my period of expertise, and I am not specifically a military historian, I will let my colleagues tackle this if they wish, but I would point to the fact that Congress has defined the militia differently over time, and as pointed out in another response, the rise of the National Guard codified the militia in a way that was clearly different from colonial understandings.  You might wish to look at the The Efficiency in Militia Act of 1903 passed by congress to get one such example.

One last note:  Because of the politicization of the gun issue, the diminishing role of the militia in United States defense and the rise of the Professional (standing) Army has often been treated in a bubble.  But I would argue that you can see parallels in other American institutions as well, where previously services that were volunteer or privatized and sometimes scattershot begin to be seen as disorganized, unresponsive, or ill-equipped to handle the challenges of an expanding population and urbanization over time (and particularly by the late 19th and early 20th centuries) and that expanded roles for government organization and professionalization are called for:  The evolution of city watch and Sheriffs to the Robert Peel model of policing that is the foundation for much of our structure of modern police forces; there is a similar evolution from volunteer firefighters into modern professional Firefighters.  Since Police, Military, and Fire response all entail safety and all have had somewhat similar evolutions into professionalization and government institutionalization, looking at the way who is tasked to do these behaviors – and who is prohibited – may provide insight into how control over these institutions have evolved without stepping on the second amendment political landmine.

750,AskHistorians,"Did East and West Berlin share water, sewage, gas and electricity networks? How did this work in practice? Who controlled supply and was it ever used to their advantage?","> In his introduction to Funeral in Berlin, Len Deighton mentions that East and West Berlin shared their water, sewage, gas and electricity networks. It makes sense that you can't just suddenly split these networks (especially water and sewage) into two, but I'm interested to know if this continued until unification and how this worked in practice. How did charging work?

He appears to be mistaken. The separation of East and West Berlin's underground utility networks (electricity, water, town gas/natural gas, and sewage) began during the period of the Berlin Blockade (June 1948-May 1949) amid heightened tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. This process was mostly completed by the early 1950s, save for a minority of the sewage network as, presumably, separating, blocking, or re-routing a certain number of the large underground sewage tunnels that happened to pass in between the two halves of the city was logistically difficult. Although West Berlin invested in its own sewage treatment plants, most of the sewage that West Berlin produced was actually disposed of by sewage farms located in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) just outside the boundaries of the city, and East German authorities never disrupted this arrangement. During the Berlin Blockade, however, sewage was disposed of by dumping it into the Spree and Havel Rivers for want of sufficient electricity to run the pumps to the sewage farms.

After the 1971 Berlin Agreement, which reduced tensions, East Berlin and East Germany formally agreed to process a certain proportion of solid waste originating within West Berlin; before, this waste had been disposed of in the city itself by incineration.

During the Berlin Blockade, the separation of utilities was not yet completed, and electricity to West Berlin was cut off by Soviet authorities as the generating plants were still in their zone. Fuel such as coal, in addition to food and other supplies, had to be flown in to keep West Berlin's lights on as all road and rail links had been severed. After the end of the blockade in May 1949, East German power stations began to supply West Berlin with electricity again, but authorities in West Berlin had committed by that point to becoming independent from the East in this regard. A new power station, funded with Marshall Plan aid, was opened in December 1949. On 21 September 1950, the last power lines to East Berlin were turned off, and the West Berlin power station assumed the entire electrical load for the half-city.

The city of Berlin took over the task of municipal water supply from individual consumers' wells in the 1870s after the unification of the German states, and shifted drawing water from a point on the Spree River at Stralau to plants above and below the city. Berlin is located in an *urstromtal*, or glacial valley, and West Berlin chiefly relied on groundwater processed through a water treatment plant. The rapid consumption of this water, as it was estimated that only ten to fifteen percent of runoff actually re-entered the water table, began to become a problem in the 1960s. Efforts to restore the level of groundwater through natural sources, such as the utilization of groundwater that infiltrated into the area of West Berlin from outside the boundaries of the city, and the conservation of water, were deemed successful by the 1980s.

By the 1950s, West Berlin was independent in the production of town gas (before the widespread usage of natural gas, gases derived from coal or oil were commonly used for for domestic heating), but in 1985 secured a spur of the Soviet natural gas line that supplied East Germany.

The land border between East and West Berlin was essentially sealed in May 1952, leading to a transformation of the public transit networks in each part. The remaining sewer tunnels between East and West Berlin proved to be an attractive route for escapees, many assisted by a secret organization of West Berlin university students known as the Girrmann Group. It is estimated that as many as 300 people used the sewers to escape East Berlin between 1961 and 1989, but by the early 1960s with the Berlin Wall being constructed, the prospect of escaping through the sewers became ""increasingly dangerous;"" the sewer entrances were patrolled by the East German secret police (*Stasi*). Telephone communication for ordinary citizens was cut between the two Berlins, and was not completely re-established until the mid-1970s.

> Even then the two Berlins were not totally isolated from one another, but the extent of remaining contacts was very limited: postal service, a teletype connection between the police forces, telephone connections between the transit systems and the fire departments. Western subway lines that traveled under Eastern territory without stopping, a train system in the West operated by the East, Eastern water serving a few corners of West Berlin, and sewage flowing freely under the Wall wherever gravity so dictated. The result was a need for a few discreet technical discussions and an occasional skirmish over fees or sovereignty. The thaw in East-West relations in 1970 led to a resumption of telephone service, a few more opportunities for people to cross the wall, and negotiations to share supplies of electricity, gas, and garbage.

751,AskHistorians,Were Africans generally aware of where slave ships were taking people? Was there any mythology surrounding this?,"One of the points that Joe Miller makes in *Way of Death* is that for newly enslaved Africans bound for the Americas, the horrors of the trans-Atlantic journey had already begun in the African interior. Those designated for sale to Europeans endured a forced march to the coast that was (a) terrible in pretty much every way; Miller estimates that about a quarter of new slaves died *before they even reached the slave ship* (b) long. The second part is especially relevant here because the journey would have taken the slave caravan through quite a bit of inhabited territory, including stopping in the occasional village. There was ample opportunity for rumors and gossip to spread among the slavers, the slaves, and the village hosts. And, equally important, there was ample opportunity for the new slaves to escape. Not only does this point to another means of news transmission, it offers another example of African awareness of white slavers' involvement and agendas. In Angola, for example, the area of Kisamba actually because quite well known for local rulers being willing to shelter fugitive slaves to keep them out of Europeans' hands.

Unfortunately, most contemporary documentation of the experience of Atlantic-bound slaves in Africa--almost all of it from Central Africa--comes from Europeans. (West Africa is a little more complex situation in terms of long-distance trade, because the trans-Saharan trade to the Maghreb and the Near East was centuries old--and white Europeans had no qualms about dealing with Arab traders instead of white ship captains if it made the better profit. This was probably a fairly small fraction of European involvement in the African slave trade, but the trans-Saharan trade overall adds a layer of complexity). That said, there are a few reasons to take seriously some of the European reports about central African slaves' perceptions.

First, as slavers, the involved Europeans had at least some interest in slaves being able to work. A related concern that emerges on both sides of the Portuguese imperial Atlantic, is the web of behavioral/emotional/physical symptoms called *banzo* (sometimes *banzamento*), which seems to mean an enduring melancholia with a sense of longing and loss mixed in. A Portuguese petition from 1689 notes:

> Once they [new slaves] were branded with the royal stamp, they become absorbed by thoughts about their fate in Brazil and become *banzado*, which causes many of them to die. (trans. Ferreira)

Definitely as time went on, the fate of slaves across the Atlantic was deeply entrenched along the African slave coasts. The (Portuguese) governor of Luanda around 1800, Miguel Antonio de Mello, was keen on mustering ""Brazil!"" as a psychological weapon to enforce obedience still in Africa. The Luanda authorities even threatened local *slaveowners* with the forced deportation of their slaves if the owners ""let"" them misbehave in public.""There is no other punishment so deeply felt and feared,"" Mello noted, ""as being sent away to America."" He also made the connection between deportation to Brazil and the condition of *banzo* among slaves. 

As if slavery wasn't bad enough--as if disease and malnutrition and injury and abuse wasn't bad enough--as if deportation wasn't bad enough--it is apparent that up and down the central African coast, at least, different peoples nurtured variations on the same essential fear of the white slave traders. Specifically: cannibalism.

Different versions of this fear are recorded (by Europeans). The slaves passing through Luanda, it seems, were aware of one malicious rumor/belief that white people sought to cook/fry Africans and extract oil from their dead bodies. At Cassanje, further inland, the fear was straightforward murder and consumption. And Francisco Damiao Cosme, the leading physician in Angola in the late 18th century, recorded a range of gruesome terrors from the different populations of slaves he encountered. Some feared that white people wanted to turn the insides of deported slaves into cheese. Others believed their bones would be ground up and used as gunpowder.

So even though these are the records of Europeans and not the words of Africans, the underlying similarity yet topical differences points to the spread of rumors, enduring over a *long* frame of time. Accusations/fears of cannibalism against other groups of people, anthropologists recognize and historical research tends to confirm, are typically rooted in a view of that group as ""barbaric"" or uncivilized in some way. (Although this point is most commonly raised with respect to European views of various island peoples, I recently read a stomach-churning article on accounts of outsider cannibalism in medieval Islamic sources--including a picture-perfect occurrence of the ""shipwrecked sailors stranded on a desert island and taken before the cannibal king"" topos! [Reference here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5yzqeo/were_africans_generally_aware_of_where_slave/deutchv/).)

But in the context of sub-Saharan African religious beliefs, there seems to be something more at work. A frequent belief in African traditional religions, such as among the Wimbum people, is a close connection between witchcraft (here *tfu*) and actual or psychic (soul) cannibalism. This connection, I think, helps drive home just how *real* the psychological terror of ""America"" and the white traders could be among Africans who believed they were facing it, might face it, or--if they were the few and lucky--had narrowly escaped from it.

752,AskHistorians,"What and whom made the U.S. so opposed to socialized healthcare, when most of the rest of the world has adopted it?","Oh, hey, something I can respond to! To clarify, I'm a third year Health Care Administration major, so my answer will be to the best of my ability. 

National health insurance actually began in Prussia in 1888 under Otto von Bismarck. This was done partially to ensure that he had a healthy army, and also to appease those decrying poor social conditions. Prussia was able to implement state-run medicine because it was a very centralized government. The US, especially before WWI, was much more decentralized, and the federal government simply didn't have the influence, the money, or the incentive to roll out such a massive undertaking. When World War I broke out, nationalized health care began to be demonized as a ""Prussian menace inconsistent with American values"" (Starr, 1982). It's around this time that the term ""socialized medicine"" began to be used in a derogatory fashion.  

As for who opposed socialized care, the American Medical Association (AMA, no, not that AMA) was one of the most vocal detractors of nationalized health care. Seeing it as a threat to medicine as a private practice and a business, the AMA worked to kill several potential laws that during FDR's presidency that would have implemented a nationalized health care system beyond Social Security (Shi, Singh, 2017). When Truman ran on a campaign to ensure a nationalized health care system in 1948, the AMA ran the most expensive lobbying campaign up to that point comparing nationalized health care to communism. You can guess how well people took to anything related to communism in the 40's. 

Another factor that entrenched private health care in America was indirectly due to WWII. When Congress passed wage freezes to prevent hyperinflation, businesses began offering health insurance as compensation for lost wages and as a workaround the law. When the Supreme Court upheld in 1948 that this was a legitimate part of union-business negotiations, the American health insurance landscape was very firmly entrenched in the private sector. From here on out, most citizens polled said they preferred their employer being their source of insurance. In 1999, only 18% said that they would prefer to rely on the government rather than their employer for insurance(Commonwealth Fund, 2000). 

Hope that helps some. If I can answer any questions, I'll do so as well as I can. AMA (yeah, that AMA, this time).

753,AskHistorians,"When exactly did the Amish choose to socially ""stay"" in a certain time?","The Amish did not choose to ""stay"" in any given time. Instead, when a new technology comes along they ask questions about how it will affect their community, tradition of self sufficiency, and values. 

For example, you might be surprised to learn many Amish communities have a telephone or two, but they do not belong to anyone. Instead, they'll be in a booth shared by many families, and used by necessity only. If they had phones in their homes, they might be inclined to call their neighbor up the road to check how the new baby is doing, instead of visit in person, or spend their time socializing on the phone instead of spending time with their family.

The story is similar for the technological conveniences present in many Amish communities. Diesel generators, solar panels, lead-acid batteries, and pneumatic tools are all regularly found, but they pay close attention to how they use them and their affects. You might have electricity (off grid, naturally) in your store to power cash registers and lights, but still use oil lamps in the home. At work, it enables your livelihood, but at home it's an unnecessary distraction.

For a much more eloquent explanation, see here: https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/cultural-practices/technology/

For further reading I highly recommend _The Amish_ by  Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, and Steven M. Nolt (cited in the above). It's a fascinating read, it debunks most of the myths around the Amish way of life and does a good job of explaining their processes and traditions.

754,AskHistorians,"When Hitler and his entourage visited Paris in 1940 they drove around in open top cars, Hitler sat in the front seat, they didn’t block off the streets, and there was only a small group bodyguards. We’re they not worried about security, sabotage, or even a Franz Ferdinand type situation?","In early June 1940 it became clear for Charles de Gaulle and Paul Reynaud that the invasion of Paris was imminent and that fighting for their capital would only delay the inevitable fall of the city. With the city's suburbs already being targeted by the Luftwaffe and fearing to see their historical Capital ending up like Warsaw, which had resisted German invasion in 1939 and ended up heavily destroyed, they made the decision to abandon the city and go South. Their decision left Paris open for the Germans, avoided the great loss of cultural heritage and spared thousands of civilians and military lives.

Millions of people across France were also heading South or West in an attempt to escape German occupation. Paris was no exception, with abandoned cars, empty stores and apartments. A great motivator for the exodus of the local population were fears of massive air raids. How many people left Paris is uncertain but it could be as high as two thirds of the population. Roads became so crowded that the remnants of the French Army had difficulty moving across the country amongst the mass of refugees.

German troops eventually walked into Paris on June 14th 1940.

A known lover of Art and Architecture, Adolf Hitler was pleased and excited to visit Paris himself, even more than when he had visited the fallen Warsaw. Paris was a city he had been reading about since his younger days at Vienna and Munich, even before his fighting in WWI and his involvement with politics. In that triumphant moment for the German Reich, he was not only a conqueror but also a tourist. With that mentality, he formed an entourage composed of not only Military men but also people he deemed would share his appreciation for the City of Lights and its beauties. People like his architect Albert Speer, whom he expected to inspire in his plans for the rebuilding of Berlin, and the sculptor Arno Breker.

On 23 June, Hitler and his entourage left the battle headquarters at Brûly-de-Peche, also known to the Nazis as Wolfsschlucht I, near the Fench-Belgium border at around 3:30 a.m, landed at 5:00 a.m North-East of Paris and entered the city before 6:00 a.m. The Führer had pragmatic reasons for visiting Paris at such early hours. He wanted to keep interactions and contact with locals to a minimum as to reduce the risk of an attempt on his life, to facilitate his movement through the empty streets and to avoid creating any kind of drama by him being there. He proceeded with visiting multiple landmarks, didn't stop to eat or rest and was on his way back to the airfield two and half hours after he entered the city, finally taking off around 9:00 a.m. In that way, the ruler of Nazi Germany managed to visit the conquered city virtually unnoticed.

To summarize, when Adolf Hitler visited Paris in 1940 he didn't concerned himself with setting up a huge security detail because of the following reasons:

- His visit was unannounced;

- The population of Paris had vastly left the city in fear of air raids and trying to avoid being under German occupation;

- Hitler arrived and left within two and a half hours.

- His visit occurred before the majority of Paris residents left their houses.

For these reasons, the risk of an attempt on his life was minimal.

755,AskHistorians,During cold war both KGB and CIA had high ranking moles inside their organisations. Is it known which side did better job at infiltrating their opponent and getting sensitive information as cold war progressed?,"The two things to consider here are the Soviet dominance of human intelligence and a far superior Soviet counterintelligence units. So I will answer in two parts.

Soviet human intelligence vastly outpaced the CIA during the early to mid Cold War. The Soviet Union recruited young, ideologically motivated, foreign nationals (those in target states) with a high potential to reach important government positions. When many of these agents reached those positions it became clear that the CIA, MI5, and MI6 were not even under siege but instead had already become thoroughly penetrated. Author Wilderness of Mirrors, David C Martin says that ""[the CIA] was utterly ignorant of Soviet espionage operations."" Agents in the employ of the Soviet Union often installed themselves in the organization's core structure before rigorous internal counterintelligence programs were instituted. This means that the infiltrators were trusted members of the team and with this status that effectively exempted them from scrutiny, the Soviet Union knew of the vast majority of high profile intelligence operations against them before they could even leave the planning board. A good example of this is Operation Gold, a plan to dig a tunnel underneath East Berlin in order to tap regional Soviet military cables. But before the tunnel was even made, a man named George Blake compromised the operation, effectively opening up the plan and the agencies behind it to manipulation through misinformation. It is my view that the CIA was only kept in the game by strong counterintelligence agents like James Jesus Angleton and William King Harvey, but mostly Soviet walk-ins or defectors. Many of the CIA's counterintelligence victories were achieved through defectors like Walter Krivitsky and Michael Goleniewski.

In terms of counterintelligence programs, the early Soviet model was also far superior. Naturally, secret police, surveillance, and counterintelligence all come easily with a totalitarian, autocratic government. This enabled Red Army units like SMERSH (a name that amounts to ""Death to spies"" in Russian) to have free reign in convicting and killing spies as they were created as an external organ to existing Soviet military/intelligence structure. They were so effective because they targeted any threat to information security, both real and imaginary which resulted in the executions of many innocents.

So, as a brief answer to your question: during the early Cold War, the balance of power in intelligence (and counterintelligence) heavily favored the Soviets.

756,AskHistorians,"In the 1940s, the Superman radio program had him taking on the KKK. How was this received, nationwide, particularly in the south? Superman has an association with ""all-American"" values; had that already been established by this time?","I researched this event extensively for my first novel and I'm happy to share what I found.  
  
The program you're talking about was *The Adventures of Superman* which aired from 1940 through 1951 and was sponsored by Kellogg's Pep Cereal (that's going to be important in this story later). Keen comic book historians will note that this show began airing a mere two years after Superman's first comic book appearance in 1938 (Action Comics #1). This shows just how quickly Superman, and the whole concept of superheroes, had risen in popularity (in the wake of Superman, you had Batman, the Human Torch, Namor, and many lesser known debuts before the '30s ended). By the mid-40s, the entire nation was obsessed with superheroes and, of that group, Superman was king. 
  
Of course, one of the biggest reasons for Superman's rapid rise of popularity (and superheroes in general) was WWII. In every iteration (comic book, newspaper strip, radio show), Superman battled Nazis and Axis powers and bolstered the morale of American boys and girls nervous about the fates of their fathers and brothers overseas. It was the perfect combination, a villain so powerful and evil it could only be met by a hero with superpowers.  
  
And then the War ended in 1945 and the creators of these superhero stories were faced with a dilemma. Whom would the most powerful beings in the world face now that Hitler was gone?  
  
Enter human rights activist and author Stetson Kennedy. Kennedy wanted to expose the inner workings of the Ku Klux Klan to the world and so infiltrated the Klan and recorded everything he witnessed. (It should be noted that the Klan during the '40s is considered the Second Klan, and was different from the Klan of the '60s or the Klan of the 1800s. The nation was greatly divided in their opinions about the Klan and many associated the Klan with fascism) Kennedy took all of his notes exposing illegal activity on the part of the Klan to the police, however the local police refused to do anything about it, reportedly because the Klan had infiltrated the police force.  
  
And so you had a group of writers looking for a new villain comparable to the Nazis and an activist wanting to expose a group many saw as fascists in America. It was a match made in heaven.  
  
""The Clan of the Fiery Cross"" was a fifteen part series that aired in  1946. In the story, an Asian-american kid named Tommy Lee needs Superman's help as he and his family are facing opposition from a mysterious group that wears hoods and terrorizes the minority community. In the series, the writers used the information given to them by Kennedy, including code words, strategies, etc. and built a villain that was recognizable to their audience. And the audience loved it.  
  
And the Klan did not. The Klan petitioned Kellogg's to order the writers to stop the series or drop the show all together. But the reaction of the public was so unbelievably positive, Kellogg's denied the claim. This would prove to be a fatal blow to the Second Klan. The entire organization fell apart on a national level and, from the '50s through the '60s, any Klans that rose up were local groups with no true national leadership. And when the Klan rose up, they faced a reality that America now viewed them as comic book status villains instead of the freedom fighters they had hoped to portray themselves as.  
  
One trivia item of note, you talked about how Superman had as association with ""all-American"" values, and you probably think of the phrase ""Truth, Justice, and the American way."" The tag on, ""The American way,"" wasn't included in the radio show and only became part of the Superman vernacular until much later.

757,AskHistorians,"My Chinese girlfriend eats leftovers for breakfast. I find that odd growing up in the South(Louisiana), where all we eat for breakfast is ""breakfast foods"", bacon eggs etc. When did traditionally associated breakfast foods become a thing in America? And how regional are these breakfast foods?","While there's been some good information posted here to some other links, I figured I would mention one other thing.  Members of the colonial gentry ate meals quiet a bit more lavished than your average person.   A great example of this (because the sources still exist) is George Washington's Mount Vernon. 

Breakfast was usually served around 7:00AM and prepared by slaves and usually summoned by a bell. [The diary of Benjamin Latrope, who visited the estate in 1796 gave us some interesting insight into what the Washington's served their guests for breakfast](http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/dining-at-mount-vernon/). Breakfast consisted of tea, coffee, and a variety of meats (some even served cold). Other visitors also had breakfasts which heavily favored meat, including ham, cold corned beef, red herring, and cold mutton.  They also were usually accompanied by fresh vegetables. 

Strange as it may seem, chocolate was also sometimes served for breakfast, but usually just when guests arrived.  Washington desired to be a very generous host to his guests.   His accounting books also give us a lot of insight. In 1785, Washington outlined that he's been receiving hundreds of visitors a year and that he feels compelled to honor them with his hospitality.  This included paying for all their meals, which was very expensive.  In this year, he paid for 584 breakfasts (and 757 dinners!).  Hog meat was the meat most used during this year, which they used 16,000 pound of it just for guests -- and none of these figures include his own family members of the cost of feeding the servants and slaves of his guests.

edit: spelling"
758,AskHistorians,"Everyone knows about Roman slavery, and the Transanlantic Slave Trade. But how about slavery in Medieval times?","I'll let someone who is more knowledgeable about Mediterranean slavery answer some of this, but I can tackle a few of the other portions of your questions.  But to be clear, my main area of knowledge is Britain.  So while a lot of this can apply across Europe, keep in mind that I'm mostly talking about Britain.

That being said, Britain wasn't a cultural outlier, and during the height of the medieval slave trade it was very much tied in with the continent so it can provide some insight.

**The Treatment of Muslim Slaves**

Muslims (or Saracens as they called them) were treated as an ""other"" by the Anglo Saxons, but the relationship was complicated.  On the one hand, you have Synods denouncing Saracen practices, but on the other hand, Anglo Saxon medicine included materials that could only be acquired from the Islamic world and you had pilgrims like Willibald travelling to the Caliphate and you even had corrupted Arabic script appearing on the coinage of King Offa of Mercia.

The relationship between the two groups was a weird one.

But that being said, for reasons that will become clear as we go on, it's unlikely that if there were Muslim slaves in Britain they would have been treated all that differently from other slaves.  So I'll just focus on slavery in general.

**Christian Slavery**

In your question you said that you heard that ""slavery mostly died out in medieval Europe among Christians.""

That is half true, but it obscures a very important fact.

Slavery prospered for quite a long time under Christianity.  It was practiced since the early days of the Conversion, and continued to be a very common practice through to about the 11th century.  In fact, entire post-conversion cities based their economy on it.

Many times the Scandinavians take the blame for this practice, but that isn't factually accurate.  Europeans were enslaving each other long before anyone came aviking.  What the Scandinavians did was allow the European slave traders to tap into a much larger market, thanks to their extensive trade routes.  And the West responded to these new markets with wild enthusiasm.  In Britain, as an example (as that's what I'm most familiar with) we see records of enslavement going in every possible direction.  Everyone was enslaving each other, or at least trying to.  And that includes the Scandinavian ""Vikings.""  The Irish records, in particular, speak of how they managed to defeat enslave Scandinavian settlements on the island.

So that's a long way of saying that this wasn't a ""pagan"" practice, and the spread of Christianity didn't lead to it dying out.  In fact, even 500 years after the conversion we still see slave trading cities in Britain.  Bristol, for example, continued to have a thriving slave market into the 11th century.

**Becoming a Slave in Christian Society**

Raiding and wars were a common way to be enslaved in Christian Europe, but not the only way.

Even medieval legal codes made it rather easy to find yourself enslaved.  For example, in Wessex, if you were a thief your punishment would be a 60 shilling fine.  No biggie. But if you brought the stolen goods home to your family... well, under the Laws of Ine you and your whole family would be enslaved.  Permanently.  This was a particularly brutal considering that a wife couldn't bar her husband from bringing things home. So if you were married to a thief, you were at tremendous risk.  It also lead to strange outcomes like infants being enslaved for their father's crimes, which was something that really enraged Archbishop Wulfstan.

You could also find yourself enslaved because of a bad harvest.  We see records of entire communities selling themselves into slavery to a wealthy landowner who just happened to have enough food to feed them  (and given the practice of Food Rent, I can virtually guarantee that they grew the food they were given in exchange for their freedom... which is an extra-special level of awful).  And again, these people were Christians.

Slavery was big business and everyone, including the Christians, wanted in on it.

**The Rights of Slaves in Christian Society**

Now, as for the rights of slaves.  They pretty much had none.  Eventually certain laws were enacted in England that regulated the practice... kind of.

For example, you could be ransomed out of slavery.  However, the slave owner had the sole choice of whether or not to ransom you home and at what price.  Furthermore, if your family couldn't or wouldn't pay your ransom then you were stuck.  You couldn't ransom yourself because, unlike slaves under systems like the Code Noir, you couldn't work for wages yourself.  You had no income, period.

As for your well being, that's rather ugly too.  For the first year of your enslavement you have some protections.  If you die during that first year, your family can demand a weregild (it means ""man price"" and is basically a wrongful death penalty).  The thinking goes that for that first year your family had an interest in your life because they might be able to ransom you back, but after that year passes, they no longer can claim a weregild.  Which means that the slave owner no longer has to worry about paying them an expensive penalty if he kills you.  So good luck.

And if your slave master is mistreating you... Tough luck. You don't have legal standing to raise a complaint to the authorities.  You're a slave.

Slaves could also be sold overseas, which was catastrophic because it meant you had pretty much no hope of ever being freed and getting home.  Early on this seems to have been a rare occurrence, perhaps to deal with particularly unpopular members of the community.  But with the rise of the scandinavian slave trading routes, suddenly there was a lot of money to be made by selling slaves overseas.  So rather than it being a rare occurrence, it become common.  It also made ransoming very difficult because now a small villager from an impoverished kingdom would have to compete on an open market with a vast trade network that included the frigging Byzantines.

**The Social Status of Slaves in Christian Society**

There was a heavy layer of judgment laid down upon slaves.  In the early days, if you read of any complaints regarding slavery it was about how terrible it was that Christans had Pagan masters.  They never complained about Christians owning Christians, or Christians owning Pagans.  The crime they were complaining about wasn't the slavery, it was the paganism.

Well, as paganism came to an end in western Europe, they had a new line they were drawing.  Worthy vs unworthy.  Archbishops lamented how there were slaves who were ""unforworhte"".  Basically, undeserving.  Which, naturally, indicates that there were deserving slaves.  And reading the letters and sermons you get a picture of who was undeserving of being enslaved.  They were virtuous, but more importantly they were *well born*.

It follows, therefore, that the people who deserved slavery were pretty much everyone else who found themselves in that situation.  So pretty much everyone who wasn't noble and completely innocent.

This means that in addition to having virtually no way to get out of being enslaved, and having no legal rights, and being completely at the mercy of your master...  you also have everyone, including even the Archbishop, clucking their tongues and talking about how you deserve your fate.

As you can imagine, there wasn't any social mobility available for slaves outside of manumission, and they were treated pretty badly.

And again, these were Christians doing this."
759,AskHistorians,I am an Ancient Greek mercenary and I just refused to rape/plunder a city we conquered. How would my fellow mercenaries see me? Will I be mocked for making this decision or will I get a reputation for being honorable?,"We have a couple of detailed accounts of settlements being sacked by Greek mercenary forces, which gives us an impression of what these events would have looked like on the ground. 

The most reliable is Xenophon's eyewitness account of the capture of a fortified town of the Drilai in Cappadocia by a force of Greek and Thracian mercenaries cut adrift by the death of their paymaster in 401 BC. These mercenaries were making their way home, relying on plunder for supply, but also looking to pick up what riches they could. Traversing the territory of the Drilai, they soon identified a vulnerable place and planned their assault (Xenophon, *Anabasis* 5.2.13-27). The attackers first unleashed a barrage of arrows, javelins and stones on the battlements, causing the defenders to abandon their positions. That signalled the beginning of the assault proper:

> Agasias the Stymphalian, putting aside his arms and wearing only his tunic, climbed up, then pulled up another man, and meanwhile another had made the climb, so that the capture of the stronghold was accomplished, as it seemed. Thereupon the peltasts and the light troops rushed in and **proceeded to snatch whatever plunder each of them could get.**

Xenophon himself, however, who commanded the mercenaries, noticed that the defenders were gathering in their citadel and preparing a counterattack, so he held back most of the hoplites at the gate as they tried to get into the town. It soon turned out that his caution was justified:

>  After no long interval a shout arose within and men came pouring forth in flight, **some carrying with them what they had seized,** then soon a number of men that were wounded; and there was a deal of pushing about the gates. 

But he questioned the fleeing men and found that the force mounting the counterattack was not very impressive. He figured his men would be able to handle the challenge, and stopped holding them back:

> Then Xenophon ordered Tolmides the herald to proclaim that **whoever wanted to get any plunder should go in.** At that many proceeded to rush into the gates, and the crowd that was pushing in overcame the crowd that was tumbling out and shut up the enemy again in their citadel. So everything outside the citadel was seized and carried off by the Greeks.

The town of the Drilai was sacked and burned to the ground. Most of the people got away unscathed, however, because the Greeks could find no way to assault their citadel. The situation was very different in the Phoenician settlement of Motya on Sicily just 4-5 years later, when a Greek coalition army under Dionysios of Syracuse completed a mole across the bay to their island city and stormed it with siege towers. There was no safe haven left in Motya, and so the inhabitants defended their homes to the death. For days they withstood the Greek onslaught, fighting in the alleys and on the roofs of their houses. When a night attack finally broke their resolve, the scene that unfolded was horrific:

> Dionysios' entire army burst into the city, coming also by the mole, and now every spot was a scene of mass slaughter; for the Sicilian Greeks, eager to return cruelty for cruelty, slew everyone they encountered, sparing without distinction not a child, not a woman, not an elder. Dionysios, wishing to sell the inhabitants into slavery for the money he could gather, at first attempted to restrain the soldiers from murdering the captives, but when no one paid any attention to him and he saw that the fury of the Sicilian Greeks was not to be controlled, he stationed heralds to cry aloud and tell the Motyans to take refuge in the temples which were revered by the Greeks. **When this was done, the soldiers ceased their slaughter and turned to looting the property;** and the plunder yielded much silver and not a little gold, as well as costly raiment and an abundance on every other product of felicity. The city was given over by Dionysios to the soldiers to plunder, since he wished to whet their appetites for future encounters.

-- Diodoros 14.53.1-3

I'm citing these sources at length because they give a real sense of the chaos. Both among the Drilai and at Motya, the scene is one of soldiers essentially running amok, often ignoring their officers, disregarding their own safety to satisfy their urge to steal and destroy. The attacking army would break down into uncontrollable masses running this way and that. Buildings and walls would be torn down to allow safer entry and retreat; fire would be spread either by accident or on purpose; the people in the city, terrified and desperate, would either mount their last hopeless defence or do what they could to avoid becoming a victim. There was practically nothing a commander could really do to control any of this. He was generally reduced to unleashing his men and letting them do as they wished - especially if he wanted them to believe that service under him would be worth their while.

This is the context we need in order to answer your question. Within this grotesque spectacle of violence and destruction, who would notice an individual soldier who refused to rape and pillage? Who would even see that soldier, let alone care that he was not taking part? In order to be noticed, he would practically have to go around screaming ""Look at me! I am not killing or stealing! I refuse to kill or steal!"" And even then, most of his fellow mercenaries would probably be too focused on getting their own share of the loot to give our conscientious objector a second thought.

Indeed, in a typical sack there would probably be many soldiers who effectively didn't take part - either because they were too concerned about the enemy, because they were being held back on purpose, or because they simply didn't have the means to get into the city before everyone and everything inside had been captured or destroyed. As Xenophon says, many went in at the call of the herald - but not all. Some would keep themselves out or be left out. The only response they were likely to get from their fellow mercenaries was ""better luck next time"".

On the other hand, since many Greek mercenaries had to go without pay (or served on promised pay) for long periods, it would have been difficult for a mercenary to survive if he refused to steal. How else was he going to pay for his grain? There were no supply officers in Greek armies, and it was not considered a commander's duty to supply the troops - merely to supply them with a market where they could buy their own food and other necessaries. Mercenaries were therefore in constant need of either coin or human or material possessions they could sell in return for coin. So while many troops might be left out of the sack of a city or town on each occasion that a town was sacked, it would be extremely unlikely that any Greek mercenary would refuse to take part in such actions on principle. The less opportunity he had to take part in a sack and enrich himself, the more keen he would be for the next chance to pillage. If your commander was the type to try to ""live off the land"", that would require you, too, to support yourself with plunder. And there was nothing wrong with that in the eyes of the Greeks; after all,

> It is a law established for all time among all men that when a city is taken in war, the persons and the property of the inhabitants belong to the captors.

-- Xenophon, *Education of Kyros* 7.5.73

In short, if you refused to plunder or rape on one occasion, your companions probably wouldn't notice in the midst of all the chaos that accompanied the sack of a city. But if you stuck to your refusal as a matter of conscience, you would likely starve, and the fellow mercenaries who buried your remains would probably think you made a very strange choice the day you decided to become a mercenary."
760,AskHistorians,"During WW2, many famous artworks (e.g. Mona Lisa) were hidden to protect them. Are there any that never resurfaced and could very well be hidden in a grandmother's basement today?","It's a misconception that most of the artworks hidden or stolen during WW2 are truly 'lost'. It's certainly the case that many paintings, sculptures, rare books and antiques were 'expropriated' (looted) by the Nazis, on a small scale from individual Jewish families, and on a large scale from the museum collections of occupied countries. However, the process of expropriation was usually well-documented, and the locations of looted works were, more often than not, easily traced.

&#x200B;

The [Art Loss Register](http://www.artloss.com/en), the international body which maintains a list of all stolen and missing artworks, estimates that about 200,000 works were stolen during WW2, but of those, around 170,000 have been recovered, with [30,000 still missing](http://world.time.com/2013/11/07/the-top-10-most-wanted-missing-art-works-from-world-war-ii/). Today, reputable museums will consult the register before acquiring something for their collection, if there is even a possibility that the piece might have been looted during WW2. (Source: me, I'm a curator).

&#x200B;

Perhaps unsurprisingly, those works which are still missing tend to be the ones which were stolen from private collectors, or art dealers; such as Raphael's *Portrait of a Young Man*, stolen from a Polish family, and a Klimt portrait originally in the possession of a Viennese Jewish collector. That said, most 'lost' works are lost only in the sense that they are no longer with their original owners, or the owners' descendants - the actual locations of the works are frequently common knowledge, as was the case with several pieces in the possession of [Horst Wächter](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/26/nazi-art-stolen-poland-returned-horst-waechter), the son of Otto von Wächter, Nazi governor of occupied Poland. Similarly, Klimt's famous 'golden' portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, which was expropriated from her family after the *Anschluss*, was openly displayed at the Belvedere Museum in Vienna for decades, until Bloch-Bauer's surviving niece successfully mounted a legal challenge to have it returned to the family.

&#x200B;

Large museums had - and still have - systems in place for controlling their inventory, its condition and location. For example, during the German occupation of Paris, the *Jeu du Paume* courts near the Louvre were used as a kind of depot or staging post for looted artworks from French museums and private collections. Ostensibly working under the orders of the  *Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg*, or ERR, the Nazi taskforce established to oversee the expropriation of cultural treasures, the French curator and art historian [Rose Valland](https://artresearch-service.com/rose-valland-art-spy-at-the-jeu-de-paume/) was responsible for taking an inventory of all the artworks which passed through the *Jeu de Paume*. Unknown to the ERR, Valland (a) spoke excellent German, and (b) was an agent of the Resistance. She made secret copies of the inventories, which would subsequently allow most of the works which passed through her hands to be recovered after the war. Furthermore, she passed information on to her Resistance contacts relating to the shipment of artworks by rail, so that they would not mistakenly be blown up during sabotage operations.

&#x200B;

That said, there are  - as OP asked - definitely still hidden caches of looted art to be discovered. It is highly likely that many missing paintings are locked away in Swiss bank vaults, which is thought to be the fate of the Raphael portrait mentioned above. In 2012, a collection of over 1400 artworks was uncovered in the Munich apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt, a collector and art historian who was being investigated on tax evasion charges. Gurlitt was the son and grandson of notable art historians, and his father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, had collaborated with the Nazis on the expropriation and movement of 'degenerate' modern art, much of which he appears to have 'purchased' for himself at a fraction of the works' real value. Thanks to his part-Jewish ancestry, the elder Gurlitt was not prosecuted after the fall of the Reich, and claimed that his art collection had been destroyed during a bombing raid... which was taken at face value, until it showed up in his son's apartment, almost 70 years later. It is possible that we may see another 'Gurlitt' in our lifetimes, although as the period moves out of living memory, art historians will be increasingly reliant on archival records, and luck, to make these discoveries."
761,AskHistorians,"In 797, Charlemagne sent an embassy to the court of Harun al-Rashid. 5 years later, the embassy would return with numerous exotic gifts from Baghdad, including an elephant. Do we know of the Abbasids' side of this tale?","As far as poor Abul-Abaz (Abu al-Abbas, Abul-Abbas, &c) who walked from Baghdad to Germany is concerned, there's no Abbasid side of the tale. But we can still talk about lions and cheetahs and polar bears! So, why?

Menageries were a major aspect of what we call ""performing kingship"" (or sultanship, in this case) in the Middle Ages. Possession and display of exotic animals was a marker of highest status all around the world! Even non-kings wanted to get in on the act.

You might think of the polar bear swimming in the 13th century Thames on a long chain. Or the giraffe sent from the Swahili city-states to India and on to China in the 15th century. When Spanish colonizers made it to Tenochtitlan, [they interpreted Moctezuma's collection of exotic animals as a royal menagerie, too](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/58jcd4/were_humans_included_in_moctezumas_zoo/).

The joy and prestige of menageries was just as true for Islamic rulers at least from Umayyad days. But you would not have seen the equivalent of a polar bear swimming in the Tigris, nor been the 17th century Norfolk woman named Mary Jenkinson, who was in the habit of petting the lions in the Tower of London. (That story does not end happily.)

No, in Abbasid Baghdad, exotic animals were reserved for the sultan at his palace. Yaqut al-Rumi in the 12th century says that the menagerie area also included an aviary and a hunting park. Later sources suggest that menageries weren't just open-environment Jurassic Park-type free-for-alls, but included stables, fences, and other structures for animals' and keepers' protection.

Unfortunately for us and Abul Abbaz, Arabic sources tend to say a lot more about animals *incoming* than *outgoing*. For the Abbasid era, they also tend to still be in Arabic which I do not read. So I hope it is okay if I draw from near-contemporary Turkey and from Mamluk rule to give some flavor of what animals might have come to Abbasid Baghdad from Indian, Arabia, Central Asia, and Africa.

In 1258, the Ilkhanate infamously sacked Baghdad. In 1263, the Golden Horde proposed joint anti-Ilkhanate action with the Mamluk rulers. Along with a whole mess of other diplomatic gifts, they reached out to signal their sincerity with:

* elephants
* giraffes
* Arabian stallions
* multiple kinds of donkey
* what Donald Little refers to as ""racing camels"" and boy do I want to know about medieval camel races now
* Arabian racehorses, specifically

Oh, and also various armour and clothing and other accoutrements for the animals, of course.

(Animal clothing was A Thing in the medieval world. Medieval Arab veterinary writers are deeply unhappy with the owners of hunting dogs keeping them warm in clothing of fine brocade instead of in leftover scraps. In the case of gifts, of course, we are thinking something along Indian wedding dress lines...probably not so much for hunting dogs.)

Al-Maqrizi, visiting a royal menagerie in 9th century Turkey (shortly after Charlemagne's day), was very impressed with the animal selection and hence with ruler Khumarawayh:

* songbirds (discussed at some length)
* elephants
* tigers
* cheetahs
* giraffes
* horses
* camels
* donkeys

and--as we might imagine poor Mary Jenkinson had once believed--a pair of lions who were especially beloved by and tame for the sultan.

So we have no words from an Abbasid zookeeper weeping at the loss of their elephant to the Frankish barbarians (as contemporary Arabic sources would have it), or of their family devasted by losing a member to the expedition north. 

But we can paint a lavish picture of the animal world of early medieval rulers, and of sultans taking the time out of a stressful day to pet their lions."
762,AskHistorians,"'Michael' was the most popular boys name in the US every year except one from 1954 to 1998; is it normal for one name to be so popular for so long? Are there any theories behind its popularity, or why it faded?",I’m curious what the most popular name was that single other year?
763,AskHistorians,How did Medieval kings gauge the military potential of their neighbours before acting against them?,"I may not be able to give you a complete answer as I am not able to speak intelligently on the levy system to which you refer. Hopefully another qualified individual can go into more detail on this subject. However, I am familiar with how the Byzantine Roman Empire of the Late Antique, and Medieval period waged war and hope to shed some light on how they went about, and thought about sizing up their enemies during this period. 

The Byzantine Romans were extremely conservative in their military exploits, and only risked direct engagement when odds were much in their favor. In this sense, it didn't matter how many troops their opponent could field in total, they would avoid superior forces, destroy smaller ones, use attrition and ambushes to wear down their opponents and find other regional players or rivals to attack at opportune times. 

To quote the emperor Maurice (who reigned a little before your time period, but the point remains the same for later emperors and generals)
> 
> Warfare is like hunting. Wild animals are taken by scouting, by nets, by lying in wait, by stalking, by circling around, and by other such stratagems rather than by sheer force. In waging war we should proceed in the same way, whether the enemy be many or few. To try to simply overpower the enemy in the open, hand in hand and face to face, even though you may appear to win, is an enterprise which is very risky and can result in serious harm. Apart from extreme emergency, it is ridiculous to try to gain a victory which is so costly and bring only empty glory.

And another, 

> A wise commander will not engage the enemy in pitched battle unless a truly exceptional opportunity or advantage presents itself.

Later on, in the 10th century, the Emperor Nikephoros Phokas instructs on how to gather information to ascertain if open battle can be risked, 
> 
> It is imperative first to find out the number of the enemy host and above all what kind of equipment they have, by means of spies, deserters, and prisoners. If the enemy force far outnumbers our own both in cavalry and infantry, avoid a general engagement or close combats and strive to injure the enemy with stratagems and ambushes. The time to seek general engagements with the enemy is when, with the help of God, the enemy has fled once, twice, or three time and are crippled with and fearful, while on the other hand our host is obviously confident and their thoughts of valor have been awakened. Avoid not only an enemy force of superior strength but also one of equal strength, until the might and power of God restore and fortify the oppressed hearts and souls of our host and their resolve with His might hand and power. And when this love and compassion of God is stirred by the intercession of the all-celebrated Mother of God, when She secures Her people's victory for the third time, from that moment on they need not flinch or recoil in fear, be the enemy twice the number of our host. 

The religious language not withstanding it is important to note that Nikephoros will not engage an equal or larger enemy but avoid confrontation, ambushing and harassing, until the most opportune time. Only then will he attack, and if the enemy's morale and will is broken the numbers do not matter.

To further expand on these stratagems, we have another source by the soldier and general Nikephoros Ouranos, who also wrote in the 10th century.

> The commander of the army must first make investigations through spies, prisoners, and deserters and find out the situation of each enemy area, of their villages and fortresses, as well as the size and nature of their cavalry forces. When he is well informated about all these matters, he must take into account the time of year, and he should make incursions and raids with due allowance for the season and the accessibility of the areas.
> 
> [while on the march] he should give order to the officers that each of them must detach one hundred or 150 of his light infantrymen and convert them into cavalrymen to accompany the cavalry force…. Similarly, forty or fifty of the kataphraktoi should be set apart, who will leave their heavy armor and that of their horses with the baggage train and head out with the other light horsemen. When the army approaches the enemy region for which it set out, the general guiding the army, or the doukator, must above all be quick and alert to send men out and secure information from prisoners through whom he will acquire accurate knowledge of the region. 
> 
> It often happens that one or two days before the raid is launched, a body of reinforcements from somewhere else comes to the enemy, while the spies, deserters from the enemy, and captured prisoners coming from the place a week or three to four days previously are unaware of what has happened there one or two days before. 

Nikephoros is describing that the light infantry and heavy cavalry (kataphraktoi) are converted into light cavalry (prokoursatores) to supplement the numbers of light cavalry during the march, bringing the numbers of light cavalry to between half and a third of the total force. While marching through enemy territory, the light cavalry split up into three groups, left, right and center. This formation frequently moves out to raid for provisions, but also prisoners, spies and anyone else that may provide useful information. It is also interesting that Nikephoros takes time to point out that new information is needs every few days, and after a few days a source can no longer be relied on. Based on this we can infer that the Byzantine Roman army on the march was mounting these types of maneuvers every few days, if not more often. 

If contact with the enemy was made, the light cavalry would harass and bombard the enemy viscously while the kataphraktoi were readied. If the enemy were turned to flight, they were pursued in good order. If the enemy was steadfast, the light cavalry would pull back, hopefully enticing the enemy force to pursue into an ambush or a kataphraktoi charge. The feigned retreat being one of the Byzantine Roman's favorite tactics of this time period. If the enemy remained in good order and with great numbers the light cavalry could pull back with haste, notifying the rest of the force and organize a general withdrawal until circumstances were more favorable. 

Overall, we can see two primary points, first, is that a good commander would only engage an enemy force if the conditions were favorable to him. It didn't really matter how many levies to enemy could field in their entirety, with superior intelligence and mobility, the Byzantine Roman army could take advantage of most situation, and refuse battle if no such opportunity was available. The second point is that, given the right circumstances and good generalship, a much smaller force had nothing to fear from a much larger one.

764,AskHistorians,Why Has French Culture Almost Died in Louisiana But Thrived in Quebec?,"Before responding about the specific issues in Louisiana, I would (as an anthropologist) like to point out that while Language is very important for cultural retention it is only part of what we'd identify as a community's culture. In other words, there are a lot of French (and Spanish, Canary Islander, Native American, West African, Irish, Italian, German, Jewish, Basque, etc) traditions and threads of cultural heritage in Louisiana even if relatively few still speak fluent French.

So let's talk about French communities in Louisiana. First, it is important to recognize there is not just one French community/demographic in Louisiana. Very broadly speaking there were two - people who came directly from France and were a mix of lower nobility (often younger sons with no hope of inheriting much), merchants, and people of lower classes hoping for new opportunities (ex: casket girls.) Most of these Louisiana French (often called Creoles) were either in the countryside as planters and slave owning plantation owners or in New Orleans, which was the seat of political, economic, and social power. Then you had the Acadians who had originally settled in Acadia. Cajuns (also known as Acadians) were the peasant French who first moved to Acadia (modern day Nova Scotia) before being forcibly exiled by the English and settling in large numbers in the rural swamps of Louisiana between 1765 and 1785. By 1865, this group had split into the genteel elite Acadians and the lowly peasant Cajuns (Henry 1998.)  Isolated and stigmatized by the French elite of New Orleans and Anglo newcomers, Cajuns continued to develop a unique culture separate from the rest of the state.

Then, in 1868 the so-called ""Carpet Bag Constitution"" outlawed French in Louisiana. This was part of reconstruction that was happening throughout the South after the Civil War. And to be clear there were some fantastic aspects of this new constitution including rights for the newly freed black populations in Louisiana. Those rights were strongly fought for by communities of color in the state (see [this amazing poster](http://images.nypl.org//index.php?id=05_062&t=w)) who were influenced by other successes in places like Haiti. But the French aspect of this was a huge shift. The constitutions of 1845 and 1852 required laws to be written in both English and French.  By '64 that requirement was dropped but you still couldn't bar anyone from political office due to language and the constitution was published in French, German, and English. So in '68 this was a fairly big change as part of efforts to get Louisiana in-line with the rest of the country, which was at least at the higher political levels mostly Anglophone. In New Orleans, the shift in power and economic dynamics meant if you wanted to stay relevant you had to learn English to work with the influx of outsiders who were now politically and economically important.

But to some extent, Cajuns were far enough removed from the big city that they were able to retain a rich culture of art, folklore, music, language and dance that was transmitted orally through Cajun French from generation to generation. The 1879 state constitution reversed the requirement for primary school to all be in English, allowing Cajuns to attend public schools (when they could get to them) that taught children in their first language.

Then in the early 20th century, Louisiana undertook an aggressive effort to Anglicize Cajuns. They were forbidden from speaking Creole French in schools, encouraged to adopt more “American” last names, and to give up traditional lifeways. The state constitution of 1921 required all public schools to be in English and there were renewed efforts to get Cajuns into schools. One of the reasons they had been able to retain their culture and language was isolation but that isolation went hand in hand with poverty and lack of access to roads, electricity, or schools. In some areas this disconnect lasted as late as the 1960s. But in the 20s there was this effort to *anglicize* the nation, which followed on the heels of WWI and was common in many other areas of the nation. A shared unified and homogenous identity as Americans required selecting specific cultural traditions and connecting that with ancestry, language, appearance, etc. Anything that wasn't WASPy lost out in this cultural imaginary of American identity including French traditions in Louisiana. (If you want to learn more about Louisiana law and the French Language [this review article](https://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev)is great.)

However, that's not the end of the story. In the 1950s, a movement began within the Cajun community that rejected this Anglo-hegemony and reclaimed their culture as a source of pride. In 1968, Council for the Development of French in Louisiana ([CODOFIL](https://www.crt.state.la.us/cultural-development/codofil/)) was established to preserve and promote Cajun culture. Part of this included marketing Acadian lifeways to tourists. Cajun pride was further bolstered with the election of the initially very popular, though very corrupt, Cajun governor Edwin Edwards in 1972 who ended up serving four terms. Increased exposure led to regional and eventually national interest, which cities such as New Orleans and Lafayette successfully turned into tourist pulls. Cajun tours, villages, crafts, music, dancing, and food are now popular tourist attractions that generate large amounts of money for those regions. But as equally important, Cajuns are now proud of their ethnic and cultural heritage and little stigma remains. In 1976, South Louisiana audiences cheered as presidential candidate Ronald Reagan announced he had been appointed an, “honorary Cajun c\*\*nass,” though some of the older generation winced at the term (it is an ethnic slur.)  It seems that as the French elite and Anglo middle class began to realize the money making potential and academic interest in Cajun heritage they were willing to set aside age-old stereotypes and biases in order to make the most of this new opportunity. Today, we're seeing a modest revival of French language and attempts to retain some of the culture in concerted ways that actually have some funding.

One great resource that gets state funding is this website and set of resources on Louisiana Folklife: [http://www.louisianafolklife.org/](http://www.louisianafolklife.org/) . They have essays written by scholars (including some anthropologists that I know), photos, videos, maps, and lots of other great resources. If you want to explore you'll likely find some interesting ways that French culture has been retained in Louisiana not just through language.

So TLDR: there were specific legal and cultural efforts to Anglicize French cultural communities in Louisiana due to various political and social events such as Reconstruction and WWI.

765,AskHistorians,"In the Sherlock Holmes stories, Holmes has a little band of “street Arabs” (homeless kids) he pays to be his eyes and ears. Was giving a homeless kid a sixpence to run an errand commen back then, or does this just show how “bohemian” Holmes is in the stories? Why are they called street Arabs?","Hi! Thanks for your questions. My answers this time around are going to be a little sketchier than usual, because a lot of my books are in my office, and my building and my university library are both shut down, so I don't have access to many of my usual sources. So those of you who think that my responses tend to be longwinded can breathe a sigh of relief!

I don't think I have to go into too much detail about child poverty in Victorian England. Suffice it to say that it was endemic, widespread, and absolutely heartbreaking. As the ""outdoor relief"" of charity gave way to the ""indoor relief"" of workhouses and Ragged Schools over the course of the 19th century, the measures being taken to try to care for the staggering number of poor children in some cases only made things worse. And much of that has to do with how the poor were seen and treated.

The term ""street Arab"" has its origin in Thomas Guthrie's influential 1847 ""First Plea for Ragged Schools,"" describing the awful plight of children in Edinburgh by comparing them to, among others, Arabs. Because I really can't put it any better, here I will extensively quote Lindsay Smith's 2008 article about the way ""street Arabs"" were depicted in photography:

>The by no means inconsequential coinage of the term 'street Arab' in Thomas Guthrie's 'First Plea for Ragged Schools', first published in pamphlet form in Edinburgh in 1847, makes the correlation between the child and a bestial other, between city and desert:

>""These Arabs of the city are as wild as those of the desert, and must be broken into three habits, - those of discipline, learning, and industry, not to speak of cleanliness. To accomplish this ... hard words and harder blows are thrown away here. With these, alas! they are too familiar at home, and have learned to be as indifferent to them as the smith's dog to the shower of sparks."" (30)

The association is clear: the people, including the children, on the street are associated with the figure of the racial Other, someone who is almost sub-human, associated with dirtiness, poverty, and criminality, an object of pity but also revulsion. Guthrie also tells the story of an orphan child in Africa coming out of the desert to a missionary (the implication is that a kindhearted missionary would help the child), making an appeal to the reader that such a story""will prove as successful with kind hearts at home"" (31). But Smith demonstrates that this framing carries a condemnation of the ""street Arab"" as well, the implication being that they are failing to be authentic, that they are a poor likeness of a ""real"" Arab, out of place in the British world but not the real thing, either, someone with no proper place or status.

For a mocking portrayal of this figure in the public imagination, check out the poem [""The Arab,""](https://www.bartleby.com/360/9/143.html) in which Charles Stuart Calverley imagines a conversation with an ""Arab"" who the reader soon realizes is a street vendor, selling newspapers and offering to polish the speaker's shoes. It's worth noting where the speaker tells this ""Arab"" that his skin color is not from his ethnicity (""due to nature"") but from blacking shoes: his low-class work has made his skin match that of a ""real"" Arab, at least in the eyes of the speaker (as has, it seems, his rough life, as the child always has ""at least one black eye""). Pretty tellingly, despite his pity for the ""Arab,"" the speaker gives him nothing and sends him away, filled with disgust: ""Flee, child, flee!""

*Crime and Punishment in Victorian England* describes the infamous slum of St Giles: ""Here, as in Whitechapel, Shoreditch, the Ratcliffe Highway and other places where survival is a struggle, many of the children seen 'fluttering in rags' are taking their first steps in criminal careers that may one day get them imprisoned, transported, or worse. These 'street arabs' are to be seen 'in vast shoals' at the street markets, loitering with clear intent by shops whose wares are displayed in the street and doorway and prowling in districts in which it might be possible to steal fruit and comestibles from costermongers' barrows..."" (etc.) ""Some children have been sent out to steal--often at the tender age of only six or seven--and some are hungry, while others are egged on by their mischievous friends"" (14-15). As is too often the case, the association of poverty with crime was absolutely ingrained in the Victorians, and often grinding poverty only became visible to other classes when it entered into their lives in the form of crime.

To answer your other question, it was not at all uncommon to give money to people, adults and children alike, to run errands. ""Casual"" work was becoming increasingly common in Victorian cities, and often people would survive by doing such odd jobs. Look no further than the child Scrooge pays to fetch the turkey to Bob Cratchit's house. Scrooge is rather more generous than Holmes, it seems, as he gives the boy ""half-a-crown,"" five times the sixpence Holmes offers. While I don't have on hand the going rates for casual work, I have found sixpence to be a pretty common price asked for small tasks performed for the middle class, such as holding a horse, carrying luggage, or wrapping a purchase in paper.

Edit: I've since heard that faculty and PhD students can still use the side door to the library to access books, so at least I've got that going for me, which is nice."
766,AskHistorians,"The Incas were able to construct one of the ""greatest imperial states in human history"" without money or markets. How did the Inca Empire function without money?","  he older answers cited below are good, I might add a couple of thoughts from an archaeological perspective. The short answer is that the Inka did not need currency to operate or expand. There were items like finely-woven textiles and Spondylus ornaments that probably had convertible value, and were often given by elites to other elites, but were not really money. La Lone (1994) once described the Inka economy as “supply on demand”- or one that met institutional goals rather than the motivations of a market economy.

The Inka state functioned by what we (most historians and archaeologists) understand to long-standing cultural conventions related to reciprocity. This study relates to a larger body of literature in economic anthropology (among other specializations) that study the ideas related to “gifts”, particularly how they create obligations to give, to receive, and to repay, sometimes in the absence of (or in spite of) a monetary system.  

The Quechua word (one of the most common languages spoken within the Inka empire) is *ayni*, which implies that when people are give something, they are entitled to receive of comparable value back (i.e., balanced reciprocity). So a common situation is that various community members might help a family till a potato field and, at a later date, that family might then later help various people sheer and store their llama wool. These obligations are often phrased in the language of kinship, relatives being expected to help other relatives. This turn taking is sometimes called *mit’a* in Quechua and is still practiced across many highland portions of the Central Andes. One of my favorite books that beautifully details the subject (among others) is *The Articulated Peasant* by Enrique Mayer.

The Inka were among the last in a long line of indigenous polities that interacted with local populations using familiar idioms of kinship to appropriate people’s labor and resources (see Silverblatt 1988). There were several different taxes and obligations, the most relevant is one called *mit’a* service, levied on able-bodied males. Mit’a service was usually scheduled to coincide with agricultural downtime and included a range of activities from construction projects to military service.  This helped the Inka commission the building of road networks, large estates, and conquer or reclaim lots of new agricultural land. The latter is quite critical, as the Inka would commission the building of many terraced fields, and the agricultural resources of these fields was reserved for the Inka state. In some cases, the Inka would relocate entire populations (called mitmaqkuna settlers) to work on newly claimed lands. These agrarian staples would be stored in storehouses called qollqa, and reserves used to support the Inka themselves, other laborers, the military, etc., and the Inka kept a careful accounting of their resources using khipu (for an example, read Urton and Chu 2015).

The Inka, in turn, were expected to repay local communities for their labor. They did so in several ways, including displays of hospitality and generosity. Organizing festivities- replete with food and beverage- for the commoners was frequent. The archaeological site of Huanaco Pampa is a good case study. This was a large architectural site surrounded by qollqas, but most of the pottery was related to the brewing and serving of corn beer (*chicha*)- suggesting it was the site that helped to provision or host these festivals (Morris and Edwards 1985).

The advantage of mit’a labor taxation (called corvée labor elsewhere) is that, in theory, it doesn’t require people to give the state their own agricultural resources. Giving the state, say, 10% of your food or money in a lean year but be the difference between life and death. But giving the state a month of work during the time that doesn’t interfere with the planting, harvesting, canal cleaning, etc., tasks avoids this problem. By claiming or reclaiming land that wasn’t being used (again, in theory), the Inka allowed (friendly) people to keep their ancestral fields in return for their labor. Their labor would simply be directed toward securing new sources of food, corn beer, textiles, and other supplies for the state.

An early Inka historian, Cobo (1979: 234), wrote, “One thing that should be pointed out with respect to the amount of tribute that they brought to the king, and it is that there was no other rate or limit, either of the people that the provinces gave for the mita labor service or in other requirements, except the will of the Inca. The people were never asked to make a fixed contribution of anything, byt all of the people needed were called for aforementioned jobs, sometimes in larger numbers, according to the Inca’s desire...”

Murra (1980) discusses how labor taxation was probably changing by the time of Spanish contact, but that is a different subject. If you would like to read about the Inka in more detail, my recommendation is D’Altroy’s recent book *The Incas*, which shows all the signs of being a new gold standard in the archaeology of the region.

Hope this helps some. To sum up, the Inka didn’t develop from a tradition that used money as we know it, and instead relied upon taxing people’s labor rather than their wealth to realize their imperial ambitions.

767,AskHistorians,"Modern depictions of Cerberus often look like a three-headed Rottweiler. Is this a result of modern perceptions of ""tough"" or ""guard"" dogs, or did the Romans have a specific breed in mind when they described this creature?","""There...in the palace of greedy Pluto, the savage dog \[Cerberus\] frightens the shades; tossing back and forth his triple heads, with terrible baying he guards the realm. Around his head, foul with corruption, serpents lap; his shaggy mane bristles with vipers, and in his twisted tail a long snake hisses. His rage matches his shape. Soon as he feels the stir of feet he raises his head, rough with darting snakes, and with ears erect catches at the sound..."" (Seneca, *Hercules Furens*, 782f)

That is not a dog you want to mess with - nor, in fact, a dog at all. Cerberus was a monster who just happened to be dog-shaped. As such, he was never associated in art or literature with any particular ancient breed. He tended, however, to be represented more or less as a Molossian hound, the classical world's default guard dog.

Molossians were huge, deep-chested mastiffs (you can get [an idea of what they looked like from this](https://research.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=365531001&objectId=467443&partId=1) famous sculpture). Although their name referred to the tribe in northwestern Greece said to have first bred them, Molossians weren't anything like a unitary breed; the name was probably applied to any suitably large and ferocious dog.

Molossians were originally bred to hunt boar and guard flocks. In the Roman era, however - besides their occasional service pulling chariots in novelty races - they were famous as guard dogs. In Petronius' *Satyricon*, the vulgar freedman Trimalchio has an enormous Molossian guard dog named Scylax (""Puppy""), which terrifies the protagonist. Not all guard dogs were Molossians; the unfortunate guard dog [buried in Pompeii](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dog_in_chains_cast_Pompeii_Museum_Boscoreale.jpg), for example, was smaller and leaner, as was the fierce critter represented in the famous [""Cave Canem"" (Beware of dog) mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beware_of_the_dog#/media/File:Dom_dramaturga.jpg) in the same city.

Several other ""breeds"" are well-attested. The so-called Indian hounds, valued by the wealthy for their hunting prowess, were thought to have tiger blood (this, it was thought, explained their rarity; the tigers supposedly ate the dogs as often as they mated with them). Laconian (Spartan) hounds (which probably [looked like this](https://www.pinterest.com.mx/pin/398005685791717803/) Roman pair) were famously swift, and were used to run down hares and deer until the mid-imperial era, when they were replaced by the Gallic vertragus, an ancestor of the modern greyhound.

The favorite pet dog, however, was the thoroughly ridiculous ""Maltese."" In the Roman world, this was the stereotypical pet of the rich (and especially rich old widows). The poet Martial wrote a famous poem about a Maltese named Issa (""Missy,"") and several wealthy owners immortalized their lapdogs with miniature tombs. There's an especially interesting example in Athens, complete  with a life-sized sculpture of a [rather overfed little dog](http://www.ekathimerini.com/231352/gallery/ekathimerini/in-images/roman-era-sarcophagus-with-dog-sculpture-goes-on-display-in-athens) (in this case, not a standard ""Maltese"") with a jeweled collar.

Since no variety of Greek or Roman dog was as unitary as a modern, pedigreed breed, it is hard to find a modern equivalent for any given type. Molossian hounds were probably the size of large modern mastiffs; my mental image of them resembles the modern Turkish Kangal (likely because so many of those have chased me over the years). Laconian hounds seem to have looked like whippets. ""Maltese"" lapdogs apparently resembled modern Pomeranians more than the modern Maltese dog.

Whether Maltese or Molossian, the Greeks and Romans associated none of these dogs with wolves, as I discuss in [this older answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/d2n3xn/did_the_ancient_greeks_understand_that_dogs_were/ezwblq0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). And Cerberus, with his terrible baying heads and venomous tail, was identified with no earthly creature; his pedigree, after all, was pure monster."
768,AskHistorians,What happened to all the little Kings when all their little Germanies became the German Empire?,"The scope of this question runs from 1866 with the defeat of the Austrians in the Austro-Prussian war of the same year through to the split of Germany in 1945 after Hitler's defeat.

As a side note before I begin, the 'little' German nations, such as Hanover, Saxony, and Bavaria were not inconsiderable nations in their own rights. That Prussia, through the will of Bismark, was able to unify them under one flag was due in part to a nationalist zeal ignited in the post-Napoleonic period, and also in part to the declining influence of Austria/Austria-Hungary in the corresponding period. There was a desire by the rulers of the smaller constituent parts of the Germanies to avoid outright conquest by Prussia, as well as a desire to enact social reforms without a revolutionary bloodbath that had swept up France in 1792. The 1830 and 1848 revolutions stoked German liberalism and nationalism, and it took all of Bismark's political acumen to convince the disparate German nation states that the Prussian constitution and military might were worth binding under, vis-a-vie Austrian hegemony (which is why the Prussians fought the Austrian-Prussian war).  

Prussian desire for hegemony arose after the 1815 Vienna settlement in part because Prussia feared Austrian, French, and Russian encirclement. The treaty had two outcomes that would shape the rest of 19th century German history: 1) The establishment of the German Confederation, made up of 39 independent states, and 2) the treaty had ceded territory on the Rhine to Prussia. This had put Prussia under considerable internal strain, as geographically, culturally, and politically the west of the new nation was far removed from the Berlin Prussian monarchy. Napoleon's sparking of nascent German nationalism during his conquest of the Rhineland was fanned by the liberalisation of Europe during the period 1820-1848, which the Austrians under Metternich attempted to suppress. Prussia was kept in check by Austrian military and political supremacy  during this period, but as Austria lost political prestige Prussia began to reassert herself, especially when Otto von Bismark became Prussian Chancellor in 1862. Prussia, with the suport and aid of Austria, fought the 1864 Second Schleswig war against Denmark, which gave them control Schleswig-Holstein. Prussia then went to war with the German Confederation, led by Austria, in 1866, with led to the defeat of the Confederation and then to it dissolving as a political entity. in 1867 the Prussians unified the northern german states into the North German Confederation, which had a federal constitution with Prussian monarch as the head of state.

The German empire was formally declared at the Palace of Versailles on 18th January 1871, at which point the independent principalities and kingdoms of the North German Confederation, led by Prussia, merged with the south German kingdoms and principalities. At this point the various independent entities that had formally been part of the Germanies became states within the new German Reich, with their own laws, customs, and state legislatures. Central authority in the empire rested with the Emperor and the Reichtag, though the democracy that Bismark, the Prussian prime minister, envisaged was of a limited form, with ultimate power resting in the hands of the German Kaiser, who was also the King of Prussia.

Initially the 27 constituent states that formed the newly unified Germany were left to manage their own internal affairs without too much interference from Berlin, as Bismark did not wish to empower the Reichtag with too much power. Over the course of the period between 1871 and 1900 the German state centralised federal control in the hands of the civil service through the State Secretaries, with the effect that even though there was near-universal suffrage in Germany for most adult males, the power of their elected representatives was muted when compared to the bureaucrats who controlled the affairs of state at the behest of the Kaiser.

The effect for the 27 state rulers was that their pre-1871 powers were constrained by the 1871 German constitution. All states sent deputies to the the upper house called the Bundesrat, and although all states were nominally equal in the eyes of the law, as Prussia was the largest state in terms of both population and size they had 17 of the 58 seats, which meant they had little difficulty in obtaining the majority they needed to pass favourable legislation.

One key area the 27 states maintained their own control was the armed forces, so that the larger states, such as Prussia and Saxony, had their own armies, which in turn was modelled on the Prussian army. This had the consequence that during WW1 many regiments were led, or had a titular head, by members of the royal families from the various states.

In terms of the pre-1871 monarchs, Saxony's monarch Fredrick Augustus III abdicated in 1918, turning Saxony into a free state in the Wiemar republic; the same happened with Bavaria, and by the declaration of the armistice on 11th November 1918 all the monarchs who remained in power after 1871 had been removed from power in favour of republican ideals. The reasons for the loss of power are varied, ranging from a general disdain for support of Prussian policies during WWI (in the case of Bavaria and Saxony), to a ground-swell of desire to reform the country after the catastrophic defeat caused by the allies. The monarchical principals of power were discredited in the eyes of the German public by the actions of the ruling elite during the war, even to the point where the Bavarian's sought a separate peace with the allies.

Dues to this, many royal titles were abrogated in 1918, with all temporal power being transferred into the hands the people. The Wiemar government did not removed smaller titles, though, and those landowners, including the Prussian Junker class, were still classed as nobility through the Wiemar and Nazi governments. The fall of Germany in 1945 resulted in a complete overhauling of the governance of Germany in the East and West, with the nobility loosing all their privileges in the process. It is also worth remembering that many of the Prussian noble houses were absorbed into present day Poland and the Baltic states, were their estates were seized by the Communists and turned over to state control.

So, in summation to your question:
Most of the German monarchs, Dukes, and princelings of the pre-1871 era were allowed to remain as heads of state of their respective German state (much like a US governor). Due to the actions of the various monarchies during WW1 when the German Republic was declared in 1918 the states transitioned from monarchies and hereditary rulers to directly elected state legislatures, and the former monarchs either went into exile or were settled into civilian life.

769,AskHistorians,"How would I, a man who can't seem to grow facial hair, fare along my peers in late 19th century western Europe?","This is an honest and good question. Thank you for asking it. As with almost anything, it will depend on the exact time period, your social class, your employment and your geographical location. Speaking extremely broadly, in western Europe and the United States, **male facial hair grew in popularity as the 19th century progressed, peaking in the 1870s, then declined toward the end of the century.**

There are two principal sources that I would point you to: Rebecca Herzig's fantastic 2016 book *Plucked: A History of Hair Removal*, and a 2005 paper by Christopher Oldstone-Moore, entitled ""The Beard Movement in Victorian Britain"". This was published in the Autumn 2005 issue of *Victorian Studies* and is almost exactly what you're looking for. Oldstone-Moore subsequently published a 2015 book entitled *Of Beards and Men: The Revealing History of Facial Hair* that is also worthwhile but less focused on your particular subject.

Herzig's book is necessary because it provides historical and social context that Oldstone-Moore doesn't have the space to give, even in a 27-page journal paper. 

The bottom line is that from the 1840s onward, the beard (and facial hair in general) is seen as a representation of inner qualities of white, Western manliness. This is socially important in a society that is rapidly industrializing, because someone who works in a factory or behind a desk might not have other physical signs of his inward qualities. A beard was seen as a definitive sign of manliness, contrasting to the feminine face, and it was a sign of whiteness, the European ideal, because as white American and European writers frequently pointed out, beards were uncommon in Asia and among American natives. (They conveniently ignored Africans.)

T.S. Gowing's 1854 *Philosophy of Beards* was [reprinted a few years ago as a humor/satirical work](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2014/12/beards_history_and_theory_of_male_facial_hair_and_comedy.html), but in its time, it used much of the same language as pro-beard authors and publications that were published seriously. (I can't speak to how Gowing intended his work.)

The same year that Gowing's work appeared in print, an article entitled ""The Beard"" appeared in *Westminster Review*. As its anonymous author stated:

>""His potential beauty is not less than hers, but of a different, more complex, and severer order. When man's physical system is perfectly developed, his capacious chest and stalwart frame, overlaid with muscles of high relief, seem to us to require the beard for the completion of features fitted to harmonize with their vigorous outline. ... (The beard) identified as it is with sternness, dignity, and strength ─ is only the becoming complement of manliness.""

Let's also talk about race with regard to facial hair (and body hair in general). This was a *huge* issue in the nascent United States, which was grappling with its policy toward American Indians. During the 19th century, there were serious attempts to classify race ""scientifically,"" to pin down exactly what makes a person ""white,"" ""black,"" ""yellow,"" or ""red.""

Anyone who says science is pure or somehow untainted doesn't know their 19th century history. As Herzig points out in a chapter entitled ""The Hairless Indian,"" there were literally hundreds ─ if not thousands ─ of pages written by American researchers on American Indian hair removal techniques, all in the quest to determine if a lack of beards among American Indians was because they were naturally beardless or because they practiced some cultural technique that restricted facial hair growth. 

This was seen as a critical question, because if Indians practiced hair removal, they *could* have beards, and were therefore closer racially to European whites. If they *couldn't*, then they were seen as more distant racially, and therefore inferior:

""As the Pennsylvania-born naturalist and traveler William Bartram posted the problem in 1791, at issue in Indian hairlessness was whether Indians might be persuaded to 'adopt the European modes of civil society,' or whether they were inherently 'incapable of civilization' on whites' terms."" (Herzig, p. 20)

This issue of facial hair as a racial divider continued throughout the 19th century, particularly after *On the Origin of Species* became popular, and the wider public became interested in racial and ethnographic studies. The great scientific question of the 19th century was whether ""white"" people were so superior that the other people of the world could never match them, or whether those other people were held back simply because of their cultures. 

The beard factored into the ""answer"" to this question. 

But let's pull back now.

At the start of the 19th century, facial hair was not a mainstream fashion (and **you *should* consider it as fashion**, for all the discussions we've been having, which means it wasn't universal) in western Europe. It was the domain of radicals and artists. The English Chartrists adopted beards, as did political thinkers on the fringe (including Friedrich Engels, who grew one in 1840).

Following the Napoleonic Wars, European militaries adopted facial hair patterns pioneered by the French cavalry's famed moustaches and the French sappers' burly beards. Some English regiments even required their soldiers to have moustaches ─ even to the point of acquiring fake ones, according to an 1828 article in *The Times*.

In the 1840s, the British military star Gen. Charles Napier wore a beard in his Indian campaigns and encouraged his officers to do the same. At the time, there was a belief (reinforced by occasional popular and medical articles) that beards promoted good health because of a filtering effect. A beard, it was thought, was a relief to bronchial stresses caused by bad air (a perennial concern of the Victorian era). 

In 1851, Col. Edward Elers Napier (no relation to the general) went so far as to write an article suggesting that British soldiers should be required to have a beard because of its healthful effects. The Crimean War led to new standards regarding beards in the French and British militaries and inspired newspaper editorials (from *The Times*, most interestingly) in favor of the beard.

When soldiers returned from the Crimea, they brought their beards with them.

The Victorian love for medieval history (at least, as they saw it) encouraged the growth of beards as well. Think of the 1835 painting *The Chivalric Vow* or the 1839 Eglinton tournament re-enactment, which encouraged beards as part of costume. This neo-medieval attitude encouraged beards as well.

Of course, with a rise, there is a fall. In the latter part of the 19th century, the industrial revolution is well established. There is no longer a crisis of masculinity about whether an industrial job is manly or not. The need for the beard decreases, and it is spurred out the door by bacteriological and health studies that rebuke the idea of beard as filter. 

You can track the swing in popular fiction. The authors Thomas Carlyle and Charles Kingsley repeatedly wrote popular novels in which beards were representative of virtue. These novels, starting in the 1840s, seem to have been a big push in the beard movement. As Oldstone-Moore writes:

>""Carlyle and Kingsley worried in particular about how men of mind and spirit might also be true men of the world. To both of these men, the great problems of the age depended on a resolution of this problem of manliness. In a time that seemed to them both soulless and sedentary, they imagined heroic men beyond the temporal and geographic boundaries of urban modernity who succeeded in being both assertive and self-disciplined. And they gave their heroes beards to enhance this image of timeless and balanced masculinity. In so doing, Carlyle and Kingsley articulated a new rationale for beards well before they gained general respectability.""

Kingsley's classic *Westward Ho!* is the most obvious example of this trope. To quote Oldstone-Moore, ""he deployed a veritable beard code by which the reader might discern the moral worth of each character according to the condition of his face.""

In other words, the better the beard, the better the man. The villains were clean-shaven or had tiny, dyed beards.

By the time *Tarzan* becomes a famous novel, its titular character is clean-shaven because he fears that his beard is a sign that he is turning into an ape: ""True, he had seen pictures in his books of men with great masses of hair upon lip and cheek and chin, but, nevertheless, Tarzan was afraid. Almost daily he whetted his keen knife and scraped and whittled at his young beard to eradicate this degrading emblem of apehood. And so he learned to shave ─ rudely and painfully, it is true ─ but, nevertheless, effectively.""

The implication is obvious: In popular fiction, the beard has swung from being a symbol of manliness to being a symbol of crudity and unrefinement. Practically speaking, World War I and the demands of gas warfare would all but eradicate the last vestiges of beard popularity. Under the hood of a gas mask, only a narrow strip of facial hair beneath the nose would work, and that style would subsequently become famous (and infamous) as [one of its wearers gained prominence ...](http://www.charliechaplin.com/)

770,AskHistorians,"My mom doesn't like the movie ""The Revenant"" because she claims words like ""Shit"" and ""Fuck"" weren't in an early 19th century man's lexicon. When did these words enter our lexicon?","""Shit"" is one of the oldest words in English. The earliest entry in the Oxford English Dictionary is from a ninth-century text called Bald's Leechbook, which is so old that it's unreadable by modern speakers: ""Wiþ þon þe men mete untela melte & gecirre on yfele wætan & *scittan*."" Of course, the meaning of the word there is literal cow shit. On the other hand, the first documented use of ""shit!"" an an interjection is much later (1865), but keep in mind that profanity was rarely printed - in fact, the earliest three quotations in the OED are from official Army, congressional, and legal proceedings, which were required to reproduce exactly what was said, even if it was otherwise considered ""unprintable."" In any case, the word would have likely been in use during the events of The Revenant.

""Fuck"" is similarly venerable; its use as a verb dates back at least to the 16th century. It doesn't appear as an interjection in written sources until 1929, but again, the fact that printing swears was a taboo until the 20th century (Joyce's *Ulysses*, for example, was the subject of a famous obscenity case) means that the word, in its modern sense, was probably already in use for some time before anyone wrote it down."
771,AskHistorians,I’m an upper-class Englishman in Victorian England during the height of Egyptomania who has been invited to a mummy unwrapping party. What can I hope to expect?,"It would vary quite a bit. During the nineteenth century, it was possible for individual travelers to purchase mummies and ship them back to Europe without any interference from customs authorities. So, the most common sort of mummy unwrapping party would be a standard Victorian dinner party held by a friend of yours who has recently return from his travels abroad. Instead of showing photos, he would regale you with tales of his journey. As the featured event of the evening, he would bring out the mummy he had purchased, place it on a central table (could even be the billiard table in his games room) and remove the bandages any way he could. During the process, he would attempt to spook you with stories of ancient curses or impress you with his knowledge. At the end, the mummified dead body would be on display. The overall effect could be either one of a learned lecture or of telling spooky stories around a campfire.

The second type was a form of public spectacle. You would be invited to an exhibition featuring artifacts returned from Egypt (i.e. looted) and, after having traveled through the exhibit and dined, a sarcophagus would be brought out and opened with great ceremony. The mummy would be slowly unwrapped by someone with considerable expertise. The jewelry and protective amulets found within the wrappings would be shown to all and passed around. Some exhibitors even had a rotating stand which they could place the mummy on, so they could unwrap the mummy with great flourishes and show all sides as the body was slowly unveiled. After the body was unwrapped, you would be invited to come closer and gaze into the face of an ancient prince/priest/whatever. Giovanni Belzoni, a former circus strongman who was a prolific looter/Egyptologist, is perhaps the most famous of the showman-type unwrapping party throwers. (See ""Popular Exhibitions, Science and Showmanship, 1840-1910"" by Jill A. Sullivan, pp. 206ff)

The third type was the most exclusive and was part of a meeting of a learned society such as the Royal Asiatic Society or the Mechanics Institution and involve the ""great and the good"" of society (aristocrats, bishops, doctors, et c.). Such an unwrapping would be considered essentially an act of scientific study by scholars and accompanied by a lecture. You would be gathered around the mummy, which could be in its original sarcophagus or only in its bandages. The speed of the unwrapping could vary quite a bit, depending on whether those gathered were interested in the nature of the wrapping itself or in the body and the mummification processes involved. Those with the talent would be called upon to sketch the unwrapping as it proceeded with the idea of presenting the sketches as a record of the procedure or as the plates that would form part of a scholarly publication. The person doing the unwrapping would be a doctor or surgeon. Once the body was unwrapped, it would be examined minutely by the participants to determine what could be learned anatomically and about the mummification process (although some participants would likely be more voyeuristic than scientific). The body and its wrappings was usually donated to a museum after the party. Thomas Pettigrew became quite famous during Victorian times for this type of mummy unwrapping party, and wrote about such parties in the introduction to his book ""A History of Egyptian Mummies, and an Account of the Worship and Embalming of the Sacred Animals by the Egyptians; With Remarks on the Funeral Ceremonies of Different Nations, and Observations on the Mummies of the Canary Islands, of the Ancient Peruvians, Burman Priests &c"" published in 1834. "
772,AskHistorians,Did medieval sword fights really look as 'expert' and 'choreographed' as we see in films and TV? Or were they just big men swinging and hacking until one died?,"I can actually answer this one.  Like most questions, the answer depends on the context. Did people hack and slash like madmen? Yes. Did people fight with skill? Also yes. I point first to the manuscript commonly known as Pseudo - peter von Danzig. This contains an anonymous explanation of Johannes Liechtenauer's poem of the use of the long sword. It describes in great detail the skilled use of the weapon, primarily against other masters. It does describe at points the tactics of ""those who run in"" and ""Buffaloes"" who are *not* skilled with the sword. Swords have a principal of leverage to them and while strength absolutely does matter, skill tends to get you farther.  In Fiore di Liberi's manuscript (the Getty, If I recall correctly) he similarly describes the ""peasant strike"" as an over committed downward strike.

But these are weapons made to kill and they are effective at it. The manuscripts both describe ""plays"" in which an attack will lead to a counter, which in turn leads to a counter and so on. The longest one I can think of is the Zwerchhau play that ends in one death and another wound. It is approximately five distinct moves Long and takes seconds to execute. Most sword fights started and ended quickly. No fighting manuscript from medieval Europe seems to indicate that such affairs would be lengthy, and often emphasize quick bursts of strength to avoid drawn out conflict, Liechtenauer's students say frequently to ""come before him quickly and strike to the head or breast so he may not come to blows""  or to ""drive at him thus with all your strength."" 

Ms. 3227a in particular spells out a brutal message:

>You should execute begin, medium and end in one rush without break and without being stifled by your adversary and under no circumstances let him gain the opportunity to strike. 

And

> fence upwards from the left side with the whole body and with all strength, to the head or to the body wherever he may hit. And never strike to the sword but just work like would not have a weapon or if you don´t see it, and should not avoid Zeckrühr or taps, and permanently be in motion, work and contact, so the opponent may not come to strikes.

The plays described are complex thereafter. Describing quite verbosely how one is to execute each technique.  

> Gloss: Mark, this is called the twofold Failer, drive it thus: when you come to him with the pre-fencing, then stand with your left foot before and hold your sword on your right shoulder, and when he is even to you, then spring well against him with your right foot on his left side, and do as if you would hew him with a free Thwart-strike to the left side of his head, but pull the hew before it hits, and spring with your left foot on his right side, and strike there to his head. If he parries and you hit his sword, then spring over to the same side near him, and slice him in his mouth with the short edge, behind his sword with the Doubling. Or fall in with your sword over both arms with the slice.

You can read the manuscripts mentioned here over on Wiktenauer, a collection of treatises for western martial arts. Here is the link to Danzig.

We can deduce from these descriptions that, like fighting today, it is done with varying levels of skill.

773,AskHistorians,"In September 1992, Nine Network aired Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos, a programme so apparently objectionable that it was pulled off the air 24 minutes into its 60 minute run. Why was it ever made in the first place, and why was the plug pulled after they'd already made it?","I suspect others have had a crack at responding to this and been removed, but I'll see if I can provide some sourced material, since I've always loved this story.


The important background you need to know here is that Nine Network was owned and controlled at the time by the media baron Kerry Packer. The Packers (Kerry, his father Sir Frank and his father Robert Clyde - widely known as R.C.) at the time were an Australian media dynasty in the same vein as the Murdochs (Rupert and his father Sir Keith) and the Fairfax family. [1]


The Packers originally owned prominent newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne and from there accumulated wealth in both media and other ventures (particularly the Crown Casino chain). Through the middle of the 20th century these projects were quite lucrative and propelled the Packers to wealth and prominence.


Kerry Packer particularly was renowned for being a bombastic and intimidating character. In a famous episode in 1991, he was brought before the Australian House of Representatives Select Committee on Print Media to account for his bid to buy competing Fairfax Media (threatening to violate media ownership laws)[2]:


> He overwhelmed the MPs’ questioning by both fair means and foul, simply ruling some areas out of bounds, for example, and sometimes treating the elected representatives with contempt.
> 
> “Packer was not just frightening, he was frighteningly smart,” writes Paul Barry. “As a public performer he was quite breathtaking.” [3]


As now former-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (who worked for Packer for a time) said:


> ""There is a tendency to see Kerry as a mono-dimensional raging tyrant, the great Citizen Kane type of press baron, always pounding the desk and hurling abuse at minions"" [4]


All this information effectively sets up the events of Thursday 3 September 1992, when around 9pm, the only episode of Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos (ANHV) went to air on Channel 9. Packer was known for micromanagement of his television channel when programming went to air, but having grown up in print journalism, it's unlikely he was well involved in the production phases. [5]


The show was a one-off twist on Australia's Funniest Home Videos (a common format in the '90s) and consisted of video content submitted by ordinary people, as with other Funniest Home Videos episodes, but with a generally sexual flavour; awkward animal genitalia moments, flaming toilet rolls between buttocks, accidental bare breasts [6]. It had been approved by Channel 9's censor at the time and so was clear to air from a management and regulatory stand point.

But when it did go to air, Packer was dining at his home in Sydney and was watching. He was outraged by the content, called the broadcast station directly (where they had a special red phone to take his calls), and famously shouted at the technician who picked up, ""Get that shit off the air!"".


As a result, Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos never returned from the ad break. Viewers were instead greeted by a repeat of Cheers. There was no explanation given as to the change in programming at the time.


Although this was a historic (and never repeated) moment in Australian television history, the fallout was not actually that great. When it had gone to air, ANHV had only received about 60 complaints, but when the story of Packer's intervention was later propagated, over 600 complaints were received by Nine Media.


The offending episode of ANHV was actually broadcast in full 17 years later by Channel 9 in August 2008, with a joke about technical difficulties and Cheers credits inserted in the middle. All the original clips were aired, with the only changes being the removal of some of the presenter's jokes about overweight children, ironically being the content that didn't comply with 2008's media standards rules.

Packer was a very colourful character, and there are numerous other anecdotes about his temperament and behaviours (as well as a body of works from books to TV miniseries documenting his life). The story about ANHV is as much about him and the Australian TV/print media mogul age as about television or Nine Media.

While I know Wikipedia is not accepted as a source in /r/AskHistorians, I do recommend [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia%27s_Naughtiest_Home_Videos) on this particular event as a good consolidated starting point for more information; unfortunately a behind-closed-doors event like this has to be reconstructed from a constellation of anecdotes.

774,AskHistorians,Did the general person 1000 years ago know what day of the week it was? The year? Would they have a reason to need to know?,"I guess we should clarify what ""the general person"" is. European, Middle Eastern, Chinese, or African? Educated or uneducated? Upper class or lower? All of these have some bearing on the answer, and most of us will only be capable of discussing some. My own work is on the European middle ages, so that's what I'm going to be discussing here. (I think that this is doubly appropriate because I suspect that this post is a response to another post about William Manchester's (contemptible) *A World Lit Only by Fire*.) I hope to show, briefly, that not only were people aware of days, months, and years, but that they were deeply in tune with the rhythms of time. 

So the day part is pretty easy to address, and I'll start with it. For medievals, whether aristocratic or peasant or burgher, clerical or lay, Sunday was impossible to miss. Work was forbidden, plus there was obviously Mass, and so you'd be hard-pressed to find a person unaware of the day. This speaks to a point that I hope will be clear from this post: Time was governed by the sacred. What about the other days of the week? Here, again, let's look at religious services. The Divine Office, or Liturgy of the Hours( prayers like Lauds and Vespers), differed by the day, and so anyone praying the Hours would necessarily know what day of the week it was. Okay, so that's monks and priests, but what about laity? *Well*, in the later middle ages, we start seeing private devotional books of the Hours made for (wealthy, and usually female) laypersons. That's not to say that the Divine Office and the Mass were the only ways to know what day it was, but they should demonstrate the point, I think.

Talking about medievals not knowing the month is a little peculiar to me because the idea that we somehow know the seasons better than people who lived and died by agriculture is, I mean, it's just not tenable. Uneducated people still understood seasons. Educated people, of course, also understood seasons. There's this fascinatingly complex methodology of medieval *computus*, the rationale of figuring out when Easter would be based on the lunar cycle. In a world where you couldn't Google when the full moon would be, the mechanisms for working it out were really arcane and complicated and should really dissuade us from thinking that nobody knew the cycle within the year. Also, we should consider the very old chant for the moveable feasts from Epiphany - in January each year, a priest (or deacon) would literally announce to the congregation when feasts would fall during the upcoming year, what day and month. So, I mean, that presumes an awareness of what days and months are.

I suppose that years are a little harder for me to talk about, because so much medieval time is sacred and cyclical and the procession of years doesn't fit quite as easily into that. However, there was the whole millenarian thing, where a bunch of people thought that the world would end in the year 1,000, and then again in 1,033. Jay Rubenstein cites this as a major contributing factor to the pogroms, and then eventually the First Crusade. It was a really widespread belief. So I mean we can also look at chronicles and annals that say ""In this year, this happened,"" but if you want to really see ""average folk"" getting worked up over what year it was, look at millenarianism.

Obviously, I'm coming at this from the perspective of medieval religious culture, because it's what I know. I hope that this has helped to prove that no, people didn't go around blithely unaware of what day or year it was. I also realize that it's fairly surface-level, and I'll be happy to go more in-depth if I wasn't clear about something. Assuming anyone even reads this.

For a bit of further reading, I would suggest

775,AskHistorians,What was the reaction to the Beatles’ “Back in the USSR”?,"Really interesting question! The White Album actually caused quite a bit of a stir when it came out as Back In The USSR was not the only politically charged song - in fact, all 3 of the songwriters in the group added something to the double LP that the media latched on to: Paul with USSR, John with Revolution and George with Piggies. It just seemed to be on their mind, especially considering they had just spent a considerable amount of time away from politics and international relations in an ashram in India.

As you brought up, Back In The USSR was a kind of mashup parody - McCartney was lampooning Chuck Berry's overtly nationalistic ""Back In The USA"" as well as Beach Boys-esque harmonies. I'll start with the Beach Boys, as this was actually not the first time the group had poked fun at their American counterparts; ""Girl"" from Rubber Soul featured Paul and George singing ""tit tit tit"" against John's bridge in a style emulating The Beach Boys but drawing attention to their 'good boy' image. However this wasn't an aggressive dig, just lighthearted fun, and Back In The USSR was intended in the same way. In fact, Mike Love was with The Beatles in India and (supposedly, according to Mike Love) was the one who suggested the bridge should be like California Girls! His autobiography looks back at the song fondly (he also has claimed to have written other chunks of White Album songs and ""jokingly"" asked for royalities), so we can infer that if the most notoriously grumpy member of The Beach Boys was okay with it, the rest of the band must not have minded! Chuck Berry and other early rock n rollers were going out of fashion by the late 1960s, so poking fun at their style and vocal delivery was inline with The Beatles' humour - especially one so American as Chuck Berry

The media reaction is more difficult to generalise - McCartney was banned from performing in the USSR for a period of time, but so were all of The Beatles and a heap of other artists so its difficult to tell  how much of it was down to one specific song. We do know that Elton John was asked not to sing it amongst others (he did it anyway), but again the USSR was a big and complicated media machine. On home soil, a great deal of music reviewers and journalists recognised it for what it was - a parody. Other songs on the album like Piggies were much stronger in their critique of capitalism and the upper classes. Back In The USSR was the album opener, however, and some Beatles historians have looked back on this as a distinct choice to take the listener by surprise - recognisably American music backed with the most un-American lyrics imaginable.

What we have to remember with the Soviet reaction is that the government and media *didn't really like The Beatles in the first place*. They were a bastion of Western imagery and a pro-USSR song wasn't likely to make a difference! Its very easy to hype up USSR reactions or American outrage after-the-fact, but what i've gathered from reading too many Beatles books and musciology articles is that it was a joke, and most people laughed.

Edit: Grammar"
776,AskHistorians,"When it was discovered that Ronald Reagan sold weapons to Iran, in defiance of American Law, why wasn’t he impeached?","A number of congressional Democrats wanted to pursue impeachment, but there were several reasons why they ultimately decided against it:

**Domestic Politics:** 

Politically, impeachment had the potential to backfire on the Democrats. Iran-Contra had dented Reagan's public approval, but he still retained a great deal of public support. There was also no guarantee that Americans would view the scandal as severe enough to warrant impeachment. As many Republicans argued, should the president and his staff really be charged with a crime simply because they were trying to bring kidnapped Americans back home? That would have been a tough narrative for Democrats to combat. 

There was another political consideration for Democratic leaders to consider as well. Namely, any potential impeachment proceedings would probably not end until after the 1988 presidential election. Reagan would therefore already be out of office, leading Democrats to believe that impeachment would be largely superfluous. 

**Lack of evidence:**

Congress did not have conclusive proof that Reagan was directly involved in the arms-for-hostages deal. As one of the chief counsels to the Senate Iran-Contra committee stated, impeachment would have required an ""extraordinarily high standard of proof"" based on ""credible, direct, and conclusive evidence of guilt."" At the time, they didn't have access to any evidence that would fit that description. It was only after the congressional investigation that journalists and historians  discovered evidence of Reagan's central role in the Iran-Contra affair.

Congressional leaders also believed that Reagan's impeachment would have damaged the legitimacy of America's political institutions. Many Democratic leaders had sat through the Watergate proceedings and remembered the constitutional crisis it created. They simply didn't want to put the country through that again, although they stipulated they would do so if there was clear evidence of criminal actions by the president.  

**International politics:**

International politics likely played a secondary, but still significant role, in the decision not to impeach. At the same time congressional investigations into Iran-Contra were underway, Reagan was trying to establish better relations between the United States and Soviet Union. In particular, Reagan hoped that the two superpowers could soon sign a momentous nuclear arms limitation agreement. Impeachment proceedings would have greatly damaged Reagan's international standing. Foreign leaders would have no desire to work with a president whose domestic political standing was in serious doubt. Moreover, impeachment would have certainly consumed all of Reagan's attention and, consequently, stalled any chance at a U.S.-Soviet arms limitation treaty.

Taken together, these reasons led congressional Democrats to discard impeachment. The risks were too great, the rewards too little, and the outcome too uncertain.

777,AskHistorians,"Did Richard Nixon have apologists in the press throughout the Watergate scandal? If so, did those journalist lose credibility after Nixon resigned?","**Yes, and not always.**

Support for Nixon was extremely strong among conservative circles, particularly in the South, despite the scandal. Opinion polls taken in late 1973 and published in the first week of 1974 [showed vast support for the charges against Nixon, but on actual impeachment, the country was much more divided](http://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/06/archives/charges-against-nixon-called-justified-by-79-in-poll-of-impeachment.html). 

In the South, there was a popular belief that the moves against Nixon were [""little more than a Northern liberal plot,"" possibly even a Communist-inspired plot, to embarass the president.](http://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/13/archives/mood-of-deep-south-is-against-impeachment-constituents-drop-by.html) When Nixon visited Jackson, Mississippi in April 1974, he w[as greeted by a cheering crowd of 10,000 people](http://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/26/archives/nixon-is-greeted-warmly-by-10000-in-mississippi-nixon-is-welcomed.html). The local paper, the *Jackson Daily News*, published a front-page editorial saying Nixon had been ""electronically lynched each evening in the living rooms of the land"" and that the media was to blame for the president's troubles.

Nationally, William F. Buckley Jr., editor of the *National Review*, [wrote a lengthy and impassioned defense of Nixon](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=9D0CEEDF123DE63ABC4851DFB3668388669EDE) in the May 20, 1973 issue of the *New York Times.* Buckley wrote that it was inappropriate to judge the president by normal standards, and in fact what he did was not out of line with the actions of previous presidents. ""The evolution of the Presidency slowly, but not less certainly, transformed the office and presented the republic with an unwritten qualification,"" Buckley wrote. ""It is this: You must not impeach and remove a President merely for the purpose of punishing him.""

There was, of course, [ample response to Buckley](http://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/10/archives/letters-regicide-beating-raps-gorgeous-snob-william-f-buckley-jr.html). 

You might consider that Nixon had a large base of support (after all, he was elected President twice, and if you consider 1960, was nearly elected three times) that gradually eroded as more information became published. The *New York Herald Tribune* had a fairly typical pro-Nixon editorial stance before it went out of business in 1966 (h/t /u/texum for the clarification), as did the *Manchester Union Leader*. As the scandals of Nixon's second term gained light (credit the *Washington Post* here for picking up on stories that others discounted or underplayed), Nixon's support began to erode. The conservative magazine *Ideas* (it folded in 1975) was one of the longer-lasting defenders, as was William Safire, Nixon's speechwriter (before an abrupt resignation), penned a book partially in defense of Nixon. ""I'm writing this book sympathetic, but not sycophantic,"" Safire said in 1973, [two years before the book was published in 1975](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E04E0D81739E136A05750C2A9649C946490D6CF). 

When Nixon's transcripts became public in 1974, even people like Buckley deserted him. Only the hardest of hardcore supporters stayed with Nixon, and with friends in the House and Senate saying that impeachment and conviction were likely, Nixon resigned."
778,AskHistorians,Why does Liberalism have a different meaning in the United States than in Europe? When did 'liberal' become synonymous with center-left politics?,"So, this is a very complex question, to the point where entire books could be, and likely have been, written on the question of the development of Liberalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. You are also asking two different questions here, why is there a difference between continental usages of the term, and why Liberalism became synonymous with the center-left.

I will tackle the latter, rather than the former, as the specific reasons for etymological terms being utilized differently in different areas isn't my area of expertise. Also, for anyone looking to put all this in its proper context, and he does a masterful job of this, I'd suggest Eric Hobsbawm's Age of series, where he charts historical developments, including the development of the ideology of Liberalism, throughout the so-called ""Long Nineteenth Century"" between 1789 and 1914.

I will be simplifying here greatly for the sake of brevity and specificity. Liberalism is a political ideology that emphasizes the liberty of the individual, although what that means in practice is constantly changing and evolving.

A prime figure in Liberalism is John Locke, who wrote that individuals had natural rights to life, liberty, and property, and that it was unjust of governments to arbitrarily seize or restrict these natural rights. In modern times these are often called Classical Liberals.

However, there is also another political philosophy growing out of Liberalism. This philosophy is often called Social Liberalism. Many Liberals began believing that the promises of liberty and equality of Liberalism couldn't be achieved without the amelioration of material conditions and market intervention, something that Classical Liberals abhor. Classical Liberals believe that all people working in concert towards their own happiness, specifically through a free market. There are many shades of grey between these two poles, but that is the basic difference between the two different camps.

Classical Liberals believe a free and unregulated market, alongside the rule of law and democracy, are the best tools for maximizing human happiness. Social Liberals, on the other hand, believe that social conditions need to be ameliorated through government action and that a totally unregulated market can be harmful to the human condition. Many Classical Liberals made alliances of convenience or ideology with Conservatives as time went on, while Social Liberals carved out a middle position between the Conservatives and the rising Socialists, and in the modern age it can be hard to distinguish the two.

A good figure to illustrate this trend is John Stuart Mill. Another influential Liberal thinker, Mill already shows the beginnings of the move towards a more Social form of Liberalism in his earlier years.

He passionately defends the rights of the individual to be free from the tyranny of the state and that intervention by the government should only take place when an individual is harming others. He considers progressive taxes to be a form of mild robbery upon those who work harder. However, Mill believed that in theory, if it could be justified on utilitarian grounds, that is increasing the overall amount of happiness the most, government intervention could be justified.

However, later on, Mill trends more and more towards intervention in the economy and economic justice. He championed worker's co-operatives and believed that the capitalist system hindered the continued development and happiness of humanity. The object here has not changed. He championed the freedom and equality of humanity in both cases. To simplify his work, and Liberalism's changes in general greatly, the ends did not really change, only the means and the scope.

If anyone has any questions or requests for clarification feel free to ask, as this is a very brief overview of a very complex topic."
779,AskHistorians,Why was everybody kung fu fighting?,"Many would summarise it in two words: Bruce Lee.

The full story is a little more complicated. Bruce Lee rode the crest of the craze, and helped drive it to its peak, but the craze began before him.

Asian martial arts had started appearing in cinema and television already in the 1960s. For example, judo in *The Avengers* (the British TV series), karate in *The Manchurian Candidate* and *Goldfinger* and ninjas in *You Only Live Twice*.

Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, the Shaw Brothers revitalised the kung fu film in the late '60s, starting with the hugely successful and sequel-spawning *One-Armed Swordsman*. Shaw Brothers saw they were onto a good thing, and continued in the genre.

Next, Warner Brothers, in some financial difficulty, gambled on distributing some of these Hong Kong movies in the US - a cheaper gamble than making new movies. They were the first major studio to distribute such movies in the US, beginning with *Five Fingers of Death* (AKA *King Boxer*) in 1973 (first releasing it in Europe, and then in the US). *Five Fingers of Death* stayed in the top ten box office hits for months - Warner Brothers' gamble had worked. The Shaw Brothers had competitors: Golden Harvest was providing stiff competition for them, and Warner Brothers distributed Golden Harvest product, too, also with success. Warner managed three simultaneous hits, with *Five Fingers of Death* still in the top 5 after 2 months, *Deep Thrust* (AKA *Deep Thrust: The Hand of Death* AKA *Lady Whirlwind*) from Golden Harvest at number 2, and their most recent release, *Fists of Fury* (AKA *The Big Boss*), also Golden Harvest and Bruce Lee's first Hong Kong movie, at number 1.

*Five Fingers of Death* wasn't widely advertised, and word-of-mouth played a big role in its success. The kung fu craze was not just a product of marketing - clearly, people liked the movies. Box office success and popular visibility grew with successive movies, with Bruce Lee's US movie debut, *Fists of Fury* followed by his even more successful *The Chinese Connection* (AKA *Fist of Fury*), which was a major hit in Hong Kong, Europe, and Japan as well as in the US. The kung fu craze was running hot. Warner Brothers co-produced *Enter the Dragon* with Golden Harvest, for an even bigger hit. For Bruce Lee, this was a posthumous hit, with the US release about 1 month after his sudden death.

Imitation followed success, and many more kung fu movies hit the cinemas, many of low quality, many Brucesploitation movies (starring Bruce Li, Bruce Le, etc.), and with the genre no longer fresh and new compared to what had come before, the craze faded in the box office. It persisted longer in popular culture, crossing over into comics, toys, etc., and drove the popularity of kickboxing. Many young people looked for martial arts training, and found it. Following WW2, there had been growth in the teaching of Asian martial arts in the US, with ex-servicemen who had learned karate and judo in Japan starting to teach and immigrants from Asia starting to teach. Martial arts schools grew, and some trained to sometimes dubious levels of skill and went off and started their own schools. Karate and other Asian martial arts moved from being an often rather rough hobby for adults into much more of a youth activity, eventually leading to modern strip-mall karate/TKD where 3/4 of the students are young children.

While the kung fu craze died down, it didn't go away completely. It came back in a new form in the 1980s as a ninja craze, again driven by cinema, with *Enter the Ninja* an early contender in 1981. A significant part of the ninja craze was the ""white ninja"" sub-genre, exemplified by the commercially-successful and influential *American Nina* (1985), and this new craze was much more driven by American product than the earlier kung fu craze which centred on Hong Kong movies. The Hong Kong makers didn't ignore the craze, and churned out quantities of product to meet the perceived demand (including movies of amazing low budget and quality). However, while ninjas became popular, ninja movies didn't have the same kind of box office dominance seen in the '70s when *Fists of Fury* sat at number 1, and *Enter the Dragon* was a huge hit. Similar, when martial arts cinema had its next surge in the West, driven by Chinese movies like *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*, the movies were successful, the best of them being very profitable, but they sat amongst other successful and profitable movies rather than sweeping all before them."

781,AskHistorians,"RBG’s death has me thinking about Supreme Court history. Can anyone tell us about the Civil War Supreme Court? Specifically, were there Southerners on it? Did they remain loyal to the union or leave to join the Confederacy?","(1 / 4)

You've asked a lot of questions, and the answers could (and have) filled books. I'll try to address them all, though given the scope, I've left out some details.

> *Specifically, were there Southerners on it?*

..

> *I’m assuming some of the Supreme Court justices were Southerners.*

**THERE WERE EIGHT JUSTICES, INCLUDING FOUR FROM SLAVE STATES, AND ONE EMPTY SEAT**

At the time of Lincoln's election, there were eight living Supreme Court justices. One, Peter Vivian Daniel, a Democrat from Virginia, had died on May 31, 1860, during that year's Presidential campaign. President James Buchanan did not nominate a replacement before Election Day. His party was deeply divided as it was, with a Democratic National Convention less than a month before Daniel's death failing to nominate a presidential candidate. This resulted in a second convention already scheduled just a couple of weeks after Daniel died. And ultimately, that convention also failed, the Democrats could not unify, and they nominated two different presidential candidates at competing conventions. 

Rather than risking a campaign issue that might aid the Democrats' opponents and further aggravate the Democrats' divide, Buchanan decided not to nominate anybody until after the election. Of course, immediately after the election, the Secession Crisis erupted, making it even more difficult for Buchanan to actually get anybody through, and the Supreme Court nomination took a back seat. Buchanan finally did make a nomination less than a month before leaving office. On February 5, 1861, he nominated Jeremiah Black but the nomination failed by a vote of 25-26 on February 21. (Black was Buchanan's Attorney General, though stepping in as Secretary of State in the administration's final weeks when SoS Lewis Cass resigned in December 1860 over Buchanan's handling of the Fort Sumter issue. Unlike Cass, Black was very much a ""Doughface"".)

**THERE WERE SEVEN DEMOCRATS AND ONE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN ON THE BENCH**

Of the eight living justices, the court was decidedly conservative. All eight justices had been nominated by Democratic presidents. Only one non-Democrat was on the court - John McLean, the Whig-turned-conservative Republican, though even he had been nominated to the court by Andrew Jackson. 

The other seven were all conservative Democrats, though their brands of conservatism followed the geographic North/South line. Nathan Clifford, Robert Cooper Grier, and Samuel Nelson were Northern Democrats whose pre-war rulings were very much in keeping with what might be expected of Northern Democrats. John Catron, James Moore Wayne, John Archibald Campbell, and Chief Justice Roger B. Taney were all Southern Democrats whose rulings reflected that partisanship - though Taney was actually from a slaveholding family from the non-seceding slave state of Maryland.

The other three - Catron, Wayne, and Campbell - were all from states that seceded (Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama, respectively). Of them, only Campbell actually resigned, and he waited over three months after Alabama seceded to actually hand in his resignation (after Fort Sumter).

> *Were they viewed skeptically by their colleagues if they stayed?*

**THE JUSTICES TRIED TO KEEP THE COURT INTACT**

No, in fact, there was an effort by the Northern Democrats to try to ensure that the three secession-state Democrats remained on the court. McLean, too, was somewhat involved in making sure the court stayed united, but it was really Samuel Nelson of New York who took the lead. Rather than antagonism, there was something of a camaraderie among them, that they didn't want to make the situation worse, and ""break up the court"". They were also all quite old, with six of them having been serving on the court between 15 and 30 years already. Though they had disagreements about law sometimes, socially, they all got along. (A few years earlier, Benjamin Curtis resigned after the *Dred Scott* decision, after having a falling out with Taney, but that's another story). 

There were a couple of news reports in April 1861 that Campbell, Wayne, and Taney were going to resign en masse and issue a statement, first reported in the *Richmond Examiner* and *Philadedlphia Inquirer*, but these reports were pretty quickly discredited as inaccurate. Of the eight justices, the only one who really considered resigning is the one who did, and that was Campbell. Campbell would even write later on about telling Wayne of his decision, and while Wayne didn't try to stop him, he disagreed with him, and Campbell defended Wayne's own decision to stay on the court.

Outside their colleagues, there was some criticism by the press. When Campbell took his time in leaving Washington after resigning his seat, the *New York Post* called him a ""convenient spy for the Montgomery mutineers"". On the flipside, when Wayne remained on the court after the war started, the New York newspapers all praised his decision, while Atlanta's *Southern Confederacy* newspaper wrote: ""Georgia does not claim him, and he is no more of us"".

> *Did they remain loyal to the union or leave to join the Confederacy?*

..

> *Do we know about their thoughts and their decisions?*

Yes, and I'm taking ""decisions"" here to mean their decision to stay on or leave the court. If you're asking about their history of Supreme Court case decisions, that's another matter, but to put it briefly, all except McLean were conservative Democrats, and McLean was a rather conservative Republican - in comparison to a moderate like Abraham Lincoln and a progressive like Sen. Benjamin Wade of Ohio. Though to the South, McLean was way too radical. 

Again, there were three justices from seceding states on the court during the Secession Crisis - Catron of Tennessee, Wayne of Georgia, and Campbell of Alabama. And again, of the three, the only one who seriously considered resigning was the one who did, Campbell.

Nobody on the court issued a press release or anything giving a direct reason for deciding to stay or resign. But we can glean from their actions and writings what they believed.

**JOHN CATRON**

At the time of the Civil War, Supreme Court justices actually had two jobs. In February and August, they sat in session with the Supreme Court. At other parts of the year, each sat in session as one of the Circuit Court justices. Even now, each SCOTUS judge is assigned to overseeing one of the nine circuits, but in those days, the SCOTUS judge doubled as an actual Circuit Judge whenever their assigned circuit was in session.

On July 10, 1861, during John Catron's duties as a circuit court judge, he issued what is known as ""The Charge of Judge Catron to the Grand Jury at St. Louis"". These were jury instructions in which he essentially told a grand jury to treat acts committed by Confederates against the U.S. government as treason against the Constitution:

> ""...[T]he crime [of treason] is committed whenever war against the United States by those owing allegiance thereto, is raised, created, made or carried on; or when, daring a war, they adhere to the enemy, giving him aid and comfort. The terms 'levying war' embrace not merely the act of formal or declared war, but any combination, in military array, forcibly to prevent or oppose, generally, the execution of a provision either of the United States Constitution, or a United States statute: or forcibly to subvert the United States Government or any department thereof; or by force to procure the repeal or alteration of the Constitution or laws; if such combination be accompanied or followed by an act of forcible opposition in pursuance of the treasonable design.""

If that's too obscure, the July 21, 1861, edition of the *Daily Nashville Patriot* printed Catron's Charge at length, and prefaced it with:

> ""We lay before our readers this morning that portion of the charge of Judge Catron to the Grand Jury at St. Louis on the 10th [of July 1861], which relates to the crime of treason. According to the definition of the learned Judge the volunteers of the State of Tennessee are traitors in arms against their Government, and liable to be punished as such. Judge Catron is a citizen of Tennessee, and the Confederate States, yet he clings to his position under the Federal Government, and gives it aid and comfort by holding its courts, and holding over the heads of our patriotic volunteers, struggling in the cause of liberty and independence, the penalties of treason.""
 
Just three months after Fort Sumter, Catron was telling a jury in that hotbed of conflict, Missouri, to consider Confederates as traitors if they were to try to resist the enforcement of U.S. Constitutional law."
782,AskHistorians,Franklin Delano Roosevelt would be hit by repeated accusations of socialism or communist during the implementation of the New Deal . But what did actual Communists and Socialists think of the New Deal?,"The Left isn't a monolithic entity but I can talk as to the CPUSA's reactions.

Generally, they were opposed. During the Depression, they saw it as a small concession to save Capitalism, but by the War they had abandoned that stance in favor of a United Front against Fascism.

Many communists saw the Depression itself as a fulfillment of Marx's theory that capitalism would inevitably consume itself. Marx was one of the first economists to write about the 10-year boom and bust cycle, but believed that this cycle of production and 'overproduction' would inevitably destroy the entire system. According to theory, capitalists look only towards the short-term profits and undercut labor costs as a way of achieving this. Produce more and pay less. Their workers are also their consumers, however, and the prices will regularly become too much to afford - what he termed overproduction, and many Keynesian later called 'underconsumption'.

When the overvalued stocks fell through the floor in 1929, anxiety swept the public and millions tried to pull their cash from the banks all at once. This forced them to recall their loans and this in turn forced businesses to close, and put millions into debt. Merchants and farmers burned their own crops and slaughtered their livestock to artificially increase the price and try and stay afloat. Millions were put out of their jobs, often blacks before whites.  At the same time that the consumer base was being destroyed, millions were being put out onto the streets and into 'Hoovervilles'. By 1933, fully one quarter of the working population was unemployed, and in many neighborhoods unemployment was over 50%. Entire families incomes disappeared, and the prices just kept increasing.

For many communists of the time, it looked like Marx was being proven right - global capitalism was on its last leg.

The CPUSA grew tremendously during the depression, reaching their peak of 85,000 members in 1942 - just as the United States entered WWII.

The first of the three reasons for this was the creation of the Unemployment Councils in 1930.  Day-to-day, the Unemployed Councils staffed soup kitchens, flop houses, and raised demands with the administration over sanitation and bad food. They stepped in to prevent evictions and keep gas on. And through that work, they were able to ""raise consciousness"" and become embedded in the communities they served, earning their trust and winning them over to a more radical politic. They organized hundreds of thousands of the angry poor not just for demands of new employment, but an end to employment entirely. The CPUSA especially organized across racial lines, across gender lines, and the Unemployed Councils did the same, organizing white and black workers, men and women, together. 

The second was their organizing across racial lines and of black workers in particular. James W. Ford ran as the Party's vice presidential candidate for all three years of 1932, 1936 and 1940 - being the first African American to appear on a presidential ballot in the 20th century. The issue of racism was made central to the party's work. As Harry Haywood details in his autobiography [1], this wasn't entirely by the CPUSA's own choice, as most of the membership saw the question of racism as secondary to that of class. The Communist International refused to regard it as mere discrimination, however, and the CPUSA were made to put a significant focus on that issue and treat it instead as one of national oppression. To quote from their Election Platform for 1936:
> The Negro people suffer doubly. Most exploited of working people, they are also victims of Jim-Crowism and lynching. They are denied the right to live as human beings. [2]

This work lead to the creation of an active Southern Party that was almost entirely black, and a regional newspaper. The Party became involved in the case of the Scottsboro boys and lead rallies against their incarceration across the country. [3]

The third reason was their involvement in labor organizing during this period - especially in the Congress of Industrial Organizations, a union federation that was expelled from the American Federation of Labor for 'industrialism' (that is the organizing across an entire industry and not simply by trade) and for *being communist lead*. The AFL opposed strikes as anything but a last resort, and had been unable to win any through the Depression, until the 1934 strikes of the West Coast Longshoremen, Minneapolis Teamsters, and Auto-lite. All lead by Communists, and expelled from the federation in 1935 over this issue (and punching a union rep in the face during an argument over it). The CIO managed not only to maintain its shops through the depression, but to actually grow and win a dozen other strikes across the country. The CPUSA maintained control of the new federation through the rest of the 30's and enrolled many of the Unemployed Council workers on their rosters, attempting to link the interests of the employed and unemployed and grow picket lines. [4]

1936 was also the highest that they ever polled in an election, only receiving 0.26% of the vote [5] - and although Communists have historically denounced elections as a means to real progress, they have upheld them as a good measure of popularity. FDR passed the New Deal in a context where Communism was on the rise, and many communists saw this as an attempt to push off that inevitable doom of capitalism, and to undercut their growing movement by giving out quick-fixes to a deeper issue. They saw it as an attempt to save capitalism.

To quote from the Platform, again:
> Roosevelt is bitterly attacked by the forces of reaction. But he does not fight back these attacks. Roosevelt compromises. He grants but small concessions to the working people, while making big concessions to Hearst, to Wall Street, to the reactionaries.

In 1937, The Party adopted a United Front against fascism - openly declaring the need for an alliance between socialists and liberals. The 1936 platform stands as a middle ground between their previous opposition to FDR and revolutionary stance, and later tactic of the United Front. The platform both decries the New Deal and fascism - both FDR and Hoover, but in a way that Hoover is denounced as a far greater evil and FDR as merely compromising with the Right.

783,AskHistorians,Did citizens of the USSR actually do less work because they could get away with it while still meeting their quotas?,"Labor and work quotas in the USSR is a huge topic. I'll focus on food production, because that's what you've specified here. And I'll be focusing on the early years of the USSR (1920s and 1930s).

After the founding of the Soviet Union, the government was divided into different commissariats. Food production was controlled by the People's Commissariat of Nutrition (Narkompit). Although the eventual goal was a centralized food production and distribution structure, in the early years of Soviet history (through most of the 1920s), localized production and distribution were far more common. As a result, many people bought food at local small stores (lavkas). These stores were too small and localized to have a quota system like the one you described. They were essentially neighborhood shops, producing and selling based on a schedule that suited the handful of people who operated it and the neighborhood in which it operated. Although the Soviet government worked to regulate these shops, the process was often messy, with different branches of state and local agencies applying different taxes and regulations, showing the lack of any sort of central process run by Narkompit. \[For example, GARF/State Archive of the Russian Fed., F. R4041, op. 4, d. 21.\] These debates over local production could be absolutely ridiculous – in one case where an unemployed woman was selling milk (from context, likely her own breastmilk), local housing officials debated whether she should be considered a merchant or unemployed, as how this should affect what housing she had access to. (As far as I can see, they decided she not a merchant, which was good for her, because that would have drastically raised her rent rates. \[Magazine ""Zhilishchnoe tovarishchestvo, 1925.10.11, No. 38,  ""Zhilishchnye dela v sude – molokom torgovala""\]) But the takeaway from the 1920s is that, by and large, the system operated based on local conditions and needs, so there wouldn't have been any quota system to abuse as you describe. 

But by the late 1920s/early 1930s, a few key features had shifted, as we enter the period called Stalinism. Most importantly was collectivization, the massive (and often brutal) campaigns that moved peasants into collective farms. It was much easier for state agencies to collect grain from these farms, so the state began to play more of a direct role in food production. \[For a classic work on collectivization, see L. Viola, Peasant Rebels under Stalin (1996) or S. Fitzpatrick, Stalin's Peasants (1999)\] Around this time, there was also a shift in the treatment of labor discipline. (See: L. Siegelbaum, Labor Discipline, [http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1939-2/labor-discipline/](http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1939-2/labor-discipline/)) Laws passed in 1931 and 1932 made absenteeism a crime, and workers who missed even a single shift could be stripped of pay, housing, and could even face imprisonment. Although these laws were not widely enforced until 1940, they certainly would not have contributed to an environment where doing the bare minimum would be seen as a safe option. Throughout the 1930s, Soviet working culture was molded around the ideal of the shockworker (udarnik), a figure who reveled in exceeding his/her quota, which was the antithesis of what you described. Beginning in 1940, the laws about labor absenteeism became even more strict due to the incredible wartime pressures, and being habitually late (let alone clumping together shifts) could lead to imprisonment. 

For these variety of reasons, I find it very hard to believe there would be a system like the one you describe in the pre-WWII Soviet Union. But that is only part of Soviet history. After the end of Stalinism (1953), although the state remained largely in charge of managing food production, the rigid application of labor discipline laws becomes associated with the excesses of Stalinism and had been largely dismantled. By the 1970s and 80s, corruption and bureaucratism were deeply rooted, resulting in campaigns against them as a part of the perestroika and glasnost' era. It's possible the lingering focus on quotas from the 1930s, mixed with the malaise and corruption of the 1980s, led to a scenario like the one you've described. I'd be curious to hear a late Soviet historian's take on the question."
784,AskHistorians,A European ship full of spices successfully returns to her home port. What happens to the cargo next? What does the chain of supply between the ship and the dining table look like?,"Focusing on the Dutch mid 17th century spice trade, the home port of the Dutch east-Indiamen ships would be Amsterdam and this trade would be preformed by the Dutch East India company called the VOC. I will describe the journey the spices take from the moment the ship passes the city of Den Helder and enters the Zuiderzee. The Zuiderzee was a bay of the North sea and at the southwestern tip of this bay the port of Amsterdam was located. Due to the shallowness of the port, the large East-Indiamen ships could only enter the harbor at high tide and were forced to wait at the artificial fortress Isle of Pampus until the hightide arrived.

After being unloaded, the company had a choice to make, they could either sell the cargo directly at the ""Koopmansbeurs"" a large centralized market building in with al large scale commodity trading was preformed in the city, or they could store the spices in one of the many warehouses and speculate on the value of the goods. This speculation on the spice price could be very lucrative, as the prices fluctuated strongly as the arrival date of the ships was uncertain and normally distributed around Juli and August. And a fleet arriving early or late could influence supply and therefore the price drastically, making it a lucrative be it very risky venture. (Thank you [SilverStar9192](https://www.reddit.com/user/SilverStar9192/) ,for clearing this up!)

After being actioned at the Koopmansbeurs, depending on the merchant he could sell the spices in his local shop, where the journey to the plate ends quickly as the spice is consumed in Amsterdam itself. If the merchant wanted he could also choose to speculate on the spice price himself or transport it to a different market to sell it at a profit.

At the time Amsterdam was the major trading hub in Europe and traders and trading company's were shipping goods from its harbor to the entirety of Europe, assuming peace between the republic and the country receiving goods. Goods going to Western Germany and the Crownlands of the Habsburg, would be traded to the city of Rotterdam and from there using the Rhine river transported to the city's on the way and sold to local merchants who sold it to the inhabitants of the city's and towns.

TLDR: From harbor to storage to speculate on the spice price, then to the merchants fair called the ""Koopmansbeurs"", were the spice was bought by merchants who further transported the goods to European tows were they were sold to the local shopkeepers. These shopkeepers would sell the spices to their wealthy costumers who would use the spice, to spice up their food (Pun intended).

786,AskHistorians,Our current concept of Hell as a blazing inferno is based on Dante’s Inferno from the 14th century. What was the general idea of hell before then?,"With gratitude to SepehrNS for the tag! I have a couple of earlier answers that might help. The closest one is:

* [Since most of our physical and visual perceptions of hell come from Dante or later works, what did earlier medieval European Christians associate hell with in a visual or physical sense?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ii4zw6/our_current_concept_of_hell_as_a_blazing_inferno/g34le5r/)

~~

Yeah, yeah, Dante always gets all the credit. Don't get me wrong--the breathtaking scope, literary dexterity, theological and political ambition of the *Commedia* make it a suitable and attention-grabbing reference point. But Dante's versions of hell, purgatory, and heaven are deeply rooted in more than a millennium of Christian visions of the afterlife (influenced by various pre-Christian and philosophical traditions as well). For the early Middle Ages up through 1200, in fact, visions of heaven and hell were the single most popular form of religious vision narrative in the Latin west. (They don't exactly diminish in popularity afterwards, but other forms of visions become cultural tsunamis). Don't worry; for this answer I will concentrate on hell. ;)

The Bible does give us the idea of a ""lake of fire,"" but it's remarkably scant on other details. Nevertheless, already in the New Testament apocrypha (texts written a bit later than the canonical NT books), there are extensive visions of the afterlife in the *Apocalypse of Peter* and in the *Shepherd of Hermas*. The *Apocalypse of Peter* is intriguing because it already develops the idea of the contrapasso, or ""the punishment symbolizes the sin."" 

Early medieval voyages to the afterlife often take on, as a whole, the tone of a morality tale. A newly deceased sinner is given a cosmic tour, only to come back to life to spread the message of the joys of paradise/horrors of hell (and, of course, they inevitably clean up their life). One of the innovations of this era, that Dante will also draw out, is the use of hell visions as political weapons. More often this is much vaguer than Dante, like placing all the bishops who buy and sell offices in hell. But there's a reason for that. These visions are written and passed down as experiences that ""actually happened""--as genuine witnesses to the underworld.

By the high Middle Ages, there's a new wrinkle in the medieval visionary tradition: the idea that ""living saints,"" particularly women, are specially graced by God with divine visions. Although much of the women's visionary corpus is Christocentric, many visionaries receive (or ask for and are denied, as with Julian of Norwich in the 14-15C) a short trip through heaven and/or hell. Women's visionaries of purgatory, meanwhile, often involve these living saints actually *pulling people out* according to God's will and then by their own prayerful and ascetic intercession. Mechthild of Hackeborn, a late 13th century German visionary whose visions of paradise sparkle with gemstones and light, is typically proposed as Dante's ""Matilda""--that is, that he was familiar with her and her visionary text, the Liber specialis gratie.

But for my money, the best high medieval vision of hell belongs to Mechthild of *Magdeburg*, an independent religious women slightly older than her co-named monastic counterpart. Mechthild has extensive and lavishly described visions of paradise and purgatory as well, but her hell is top-notch. You can read a fair portion of [Frank Tobin's translation of it](https://books.google.com/books?id=vH3dYiGG-5sC&pg=PA127&lpg=PA127&dq=mechthild+of+magdeburg+%22its+name+is+eternal+hate%22&source=bl&ots=QUE2qXzOxh&sig=5dVj1DwrqfHRqFvz-mTh23YTCiY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj72MyVstLSAhUI-GMKHdxVD7UQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=mechthild%20of%20magdeburg%20%22its%20name%20is%20eternal%20hate%22&f=false) on Google Books (scroll down a bit on that first page), and you absolutely should.

> I have seen a city / its name is eternal hate

> It was built in the deepest abyss / From all kinds of stones of huge capital sins

> [...] Lucifer sits bound by his guilt in the deepest abyss. There flows unceasingly out of his fiery heart and out of his mouth all the sins, torments, sickness, and shame in which hell, purgatory, and the earth are so wretchedly entangled. In the bottommost part of hell, the fire, gloom, stench, shuddering, and all kinds of intense pain are the greatest.

> [...][Lucifer] grabs the proud one and thrusts him under his tail and says: ""I have not sunk so deep that I shall not lord it over you."" All the sodomites pass down his throat and live in his belly. Whenever he draws a breath, they slide into his belly. But when he coughs, they are expelled again.

> The false saints he puts upon his lap, kisses them hideously...Unceasingly he gnaws the usurer and rebukes him fo rhaving have been moved by mercy. The thief is strung up by the feet to serve in hell as a beacon, but the damned do not see the better for it.

> [...] At the top, hell has a head that is hideous and has on it numerous fierce eyes which shoot forth flames.

Oh, Mechthild!

I introduce that last bit because there is a parallel tradition that passes down ideas of (especially) hell in the Middle Ages: art. Indeed, depictions of hell were a standard feature in church sculpture, generally as part of a Last Judgment scene. And while Dante's ""gates of hell"" have their place in iconography (though note that Satan's jaws have a starring role in the lowest level of hell), Mechthild's reference to hell having a head arrives at *the* iconographic symbol of hell up to the Reformation: the hellmouth. That's right. Long before it was terrorizing the students of Sunnydale High School, hellmouths were [all over](https://www.google.com/search?q=hellmouth&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj58OiJtNLSAhUWz2MKHTdHCZMQ_AUICCgB&biw=1160&bih=552) medieval manuscripts, churches, and imaginations. Sometimes they are more reptilian, sometimes more lion-like, sometimes just abstract evil with eyes.

As far as conceptions of the afterlife go, Dante's importance is less in creativity and more in sealing the deal. The insane popularity of the *Commedia* and its enduring hold on western imaginations means we are likely to continue to talk of hell in terms of his metaphors and descriptions. But those literary devices have deep and fertile roots."
787,AskHistorians,"I've read that the Mongols destroyed Mesopotamia's canal system, and as a result the population of the region is lower today than it was before the Mongol invasion. What exactly did the Mongols do in Mesopotamia, and why did the population never recover?","Although it's certainly true that the Mongol invasion enormously disrupted the various Arab societies they clashed with, particularly in mesopotamia, I want to start by saying that there is very little you can do to an irrigation system in a single invasion that can't be fixed at some point in the next 800 years. The Mongol invasions have acquired a very imposing and specific  reputation in modern pop history and culture - the Mongols were beastial, barbaric opponents of civilisation who took thriving, complex civilisations and just kind of tossed them onto a pile of skulls. There is *some* truth to this, of course, but it's not even close to the whole story here.

So to understand what happened to Mesopotamia you have to understand a little about how it's irrigation systems worked historically. In spring as the snows start to melt, huge quantities of water thunder through the rocky, bumpy terrain of southwest anatolia, picking up speed before crashing into a vast, flat expanse of grassland called the *sawad*. Although this provides a huge amount of water and allows very complicated irrigation systems, it is also a system very prone to failure if not maintained. The flatness of the land and the force of the rivers makes it very easy for canals to burst their banks and spread out across the *sawad*, forming permanent marshes instead of nice, arable, irrigated land. What this essentially means is that Mesopotamia can support huge populations when there's a central government powerful enough to maintain these canals, whereas when the power of this central government wanes, the land becomes much less useful for agriculture. This is compounded by the fact that the *sawad* is bordered by the Arabian desert, full of nomadic pastoralists who'd be more than happy to bring their livestock to those marshy wetlands caused by canal failure, so not only does the failure of central government lead to weaker irrigation systems, these weaker irrigation systems cause the land to slip even further out of that governments control - a vicious cycle that can cause massive calamities in mesopotamian societies.

This had happened once long before the Mongols - as the Sassanid state began to decline in the late 6th and early 7th century, Arab pastoralists began to move into this newly available land. These pastoralists obviously had little interest in the whims of Ctesiphon and even less in maintaining an expensive system of canals, so we see a massive decline in mesopotamian irrigation until a central authority strong enough to reorganise the canals comes along in the form of the Abbasid caliphate in the 8th century. The Abbasids poured resources into Mesopotamia (their own centre of power) and by the so-called Arab Golden Age the canals were largely back to their former glory. 

So what we have here is a pretty simple story. The canals are in good shape under a strong central authority, that central authority starts to decline leaving the canals to decline with them. As the land turns to Marsh, nomadic pastoralists begin to settle the region, reducing the population density greatly. If we move on to look (finally) at the Mongols, I hope you'll see a pretty similar story. 

By the 1200s, the Abbasid caliphate had long been in a terminal decline. Contrary to the popular narrative of a civilisation in bloom laid low by a horde of barbarians, the Abbasids of the 13th century were a shadow of their former selves. Bagdhad's grip on territory was slowly outsourced to small landlords and petty chiefs, leaving the central government with little control of the countryside. In this period, as in the 6th century, we also see huge movements by Arab pastoralists from the peninsula. Though this movement happened all over the Arab world (its in this post golden age period that we begin to see demographics in the Arab world become more obviously 'Arab' in character.) it was very severe in Mesopotamia where dozens of Arab tribes settled in plentiful wetlands of the *Sawad*. Its likely that at this point Iraq's population was already decreasing, but hard numbers are very difficult to come by for this era. 

... and then the Mongols arrived! The Mongols removed that final tiny sliver of central authority in Iraq, forcing the Abbasids out and into Egypt where they'd live for the next few hundred years. This was the death knell for a system already essentially laid low by centuries of neglect. After this, mesopotamia becomes a prize for outside power brokers rather than a home to central authority in and of itself. Local powerbrokers and landlords ruled the area on behalf of more important power centres in Persia and Anatolia, which left the canals in a constant state of disrepair. 

So realistically it isn't anything that the Mongols did themselves to the canal system that caused the massive collapses in Iraqi population. Rather, a familiar story of a weakening central government left a very complicated and failure-prone system in such an abysmal state that the hit it took from the Mongol invasion was sufficient to cause a near permanent system collapse, which was compounded by the already ongoing shift of regional power centres away from Iraq and into Persia and Anatolia from the 11th century onwards.

788,AskHistorians,Is there a reason why the spread of Islam followed dry and arid climates in a bizarrely consistent way?,"**TL;DR: Little to do with Islam as a faith.**

Speaking in very general terms, we can speak of a few crucial processes in the geographical expansion of Islam.

***Early Arab conquests and subsequent conversions.***

The conquests of Muhammad's immediate successors, the first four ""rightly guided"" caliphs and the subsequent Umayyad dynasty, established Islam in its civilizational core: the Arabian Peninsula, the Levant, Iraq, Iran, North Africa, southern Central Asia, and formerly Andalusia. As it so happens, the initial ""opening of lands"" (*futūh al-buldān*, a term early Muslims used for the Arab conquests) did take place in fairly arid climates.

Is this because early Islam or its armies were uniquely suited for the desert? Given the geographic origin of the Arabs, there might be some merit to the idea. The Byzantines, who were in these centuries the Arabs' major enemy, actually pointed out (from Haldon 2016):

> Their people is hurt by cold, by winter, and by heavy rain. It is best, therefore, to launch attacks against them at such times rather than in good weather. Their bowstrings become slack when it is wet and because of the cold their whole body will become sluggish. Often while making their incursions and plundering raids at such times, they have become overcome by the Romans and destroyed.

But I'm overall skeptical. Let's look at some of the major regions where the early Arabs were stymied:

* The Christian kingdoms of arid Nubia (modern northern Sudan) defeated Arab conquest around 650, instead voluntarily entering into tributary relations with the caliphate.

* There was actually no serious attempt by the early Muslims to conquer Ethiopia (only an on-and-off war to halt Ethiopian piracy and take naval control of the Red Sea, which the Arabs had won by the 700s). This is despite the fact that much of the climate in northern Ethiopia (modern Eritrea) is similar to what the Arabs *did* conquer.

* The rump Roman-Byzantine empire survived despite the immense amount of resources that the caliphate poured into the conquest of Constantinople—certainly more resources than probably any campaign in Arab history. But going by climate alone, what remained of Byzantine territory was not very different from many dryish and coldish parts of Iranian Plateau that the Arabs *did* subjugate. The above quote notwithstanding, the Byzantines survived thanks less to climate and more to the details of the terrain itself, as well as a series of imperial reforms designed to restore vigor to the state.

* The Arabs failed to conquer the humid country of the Franks, yes. But it seems unlikely that any conquest would have been possible even had France had the geography of Saudi Arabia, simply because the Arab-Berber conquerors were hard-tasked just with holding Spain. Even before the Franks had shown stout resistance, the conquerors could only afford one garrison (at Narbonne) for the entirety of their holdings and alliances north of the Pyrenees. And any plans for more extended operations against the Franks were derailed by a massive rebellion of Berbers (indigenous North Africans who represented the majority of the conquerors) against Arabs beginning in 740 and the subsequent collapse of the Umayyad caliphate, an event again largely unrelated to climate.

* The Arabs never made a real attempt to penetrate the very arid Thar Desert of India either, again likely because it was too far from the imperial center.

Overall, it looks like the geopolitical conditions of both the early caliphate and its neighbors—the caliphate's imperial overstretch and Arab vs. non-Arab divisions that led to the Berber Revolt and ultimate Umayyad disintegration, but also a capable response by Byzantines, Franks, Nubians, and others—are more to credit than climate.

***Persianate expansion into Anatolia, the Balkans, and India.***

If the early expansion of Islamic civilization was driven by its Arab founders, the Turkic peoples should be credited with much of both its current reach and cultural hues. But the Turkic conquerors of Early Modern Islam were profoundly influenced by the urban civilization of Persia. Hence we call the empires they founded *Persianate*: not ethnically Persian, but still adhering to Persian cultural standards.

The Persianate empires most responsible for the geographical spread of Islam were the Seljuks in Anatolia and the Ottomans in the Balkans, and a series of Turko-Muslim dynasties in India, culminating in the Mughals.

Now, it's true that Anatolia is fairly dry and the Balkans are comparatively much wetter. In 2020, Anatolia (Turkey) is almost entirely Muslim, while the Balkans are almost all Christian. This might seem to support the idea that Islam really does spread better in arid areas.

But in Ottoman times, the Balkans themselves were nearly 40% Muslim (see McGowan 1981, *Economic Life in Ottoman Europe*, p. 84), while there was a very significant Christian minority in Anatolia. Today, a map of religions in Turkey and the Balkans matches neatly with a more arid Turkey on one side of the line and the wetter European countries on the other. But this is largely a product of ethnic cleansing and genocides during the bloody disintegration of the Ottomans in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

(You might argue that the fact that a Muslim majority was achieved in Anatolia but not in the Balkans, despite the same effect of Ottoman rule, still shows that Islam spread better in the arid region. But actually, this is simply because Anatolia was ruled by Muslims since the eleventh century and was already overwhelmingly Muslim in the 1500s, while the Balkans fell under Ottoman rule only in the late fourteenth century and was still at least 81% Christian in the 1500s.)

Meanwhile in India, most of the region—both dry *and* wet—did not convert to Islam. This is probably because the Turkic conquerors never sought to fundamentally disrupt the basic structure of Hindu rural society, which in any case proved remarkably resilient to any such would-be attempts. If anything that would have been counterproductive, since an assault on Hindu society at large would have undermined the famed riches of India that drew the conquerors there.

The two major regions of India that did see popular conversion to Islam under Mughal rule show why this didn't happen in other areas, and it's not climate.

* In western Punjab (modern Pakistani Punjab), which is relatively dry, Mughal rule was associated with a large increase in agricultural production *in areas that had previously been lightly farmed.* So a new type of society was created, with people who had never been previously been farmers (Jats, a caste of mostly herders) and had never really known that much about Hinduism becoming agriculturalists for the first time in their lives. The religion of this new society was Islam, the Mughal state religion.

* The same story goes for the eastern Bengal (modern Bangladesh), although it is on the other side of the Subcontinent and among the wettest places on Earth. Mughal rule saw agricultural intensification in places that had previously been forested, which drew local slash-and-burn farmers into a sort of economy and society they had never really lived in before. And what better god to protect them in this new world than the new God of Islam? (For a discussion of Bangladesh's conversion to Islam, see [this book](https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft067n99v9;brand=ucpress), available for free thanks to University of California).

So the key point in India is that existing Hindu societies were resilient to Islam, regardless of climate; new agriculturalist systems that formed under Islamic rule proved extremely fertile ground for the Islamic message.

***Indigenous conversion in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian Ocean, and the steppe.***

Running out of space here, so I'll have to be brief.

In **West Africa**, the current borderline between Islam and Christianity matches the border between the flat arid Sahel and the wet rainforest coast. Probably the biggest factor is that the indigenous Islamic empires that spread Islam in this region failed to expand south into the rainforest. Horses die in the African rainforest because of the tsetse fly, and the terrain and climate are drastically different. So the border of Islam here matches the borders of local empires, which in turn match the ecological and biological borders.

But Islam might have been on its way to slowly expanding south into the very humid rainforest anyways, had European imperialism not cut its advance short. By the 1800s, the polytheist king of Asante in modern Ghana was entering into regular correspondence with local Muslim leaders in northern Ghana, requesting them to pray for his health as a ""benefactor of Muslims."" At the same time, Fulani Muslims, motivated by a zeal to restore and expand the faith, were expanding into the forests of Nigeria in force. Who knows what might have happened eventually?

As for the **steppe**, you say that:

> It extends well into the steppe of Eurasia, but stops where it switches from warm steppe to cold steppe!

But historically, Islam was the religion of the elite of the *entire* Turkic steppe, all the way north to southern Siberia. Kazakhstan is less green on the map you have there because a fourth of its population are Christian Russians (with a small German minority). Ethnic Kazakhs are almost overwhelmingly Muslim, at least in name.

In **eastern Africa**, the Muslim Swahili Coast is pretty wet. It is true that Muslim Somalia is arid and Christian highland Ethiopia is not, but this is largely because Somalis were never Christian, and hence more willing to accept a new universal faith, while Ethiopia was already Christian before Islam. It might also be worth noting that Ethiopia might be majority Muslim today had a would-be Muslim conqueror had some more luck in the sixteenth century.

**Southeast Asia** is obviously all wet."
789,AskHistorians,"I'm a restless German peasant with violent tendencies in 1520. I hear about the Landsknechts and other mercenaries, and being a professional solider sounds more interesting than working the farm. How could I become one?","There were two inescapable factors of the German military situation in the early sixteenth century: one, the Holy Roman Empire had no real standing army, as such, and princes were far more eager to pay off any commitments than to do the work of raising an army for the emperor. Two, the Ottomans were *right there.* Consequently, the Landsknechte ended up not just one of the most formidable late medieval/early modern ""mercenary"" flavors, but almost certainly subject to the biggest PR campaign. For every Johann Eberlin von Gunzburg, who denounced the Landsknecht as ""soulless"" and ""living entirely in the power of the devil,"" there were piles of woodcuts and songs from prominent artists--and from warriors themselves, in some cases!--selling what we now know is a rather romanticized view of the Landsknecht.

As songs like Jörg Graﬀ's 1518 ""Ein schön Lied von der Kriegsleut Orden"" (A nice song about the orders of men at war) would have it, the Landsknecht were the new, improved crusading military orders of chivalric yesteryear. Among themselves, they were ""free men of war,"" an equal brotherhood at arms. Within society more broadly, they were a cohesive elevated status, with respect and a chance for monetary gain beyond their station. Songs tended to stress the honour and adventure of knechting (yeah, I verbed the noun), not to mention the accoutrements of women and wine that went along with the itinerant lifestyle.

And for a good while in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the publicity *worked*. When Landsknecht commander Georg von Holle recruited for a contracted (i.e. pre-funded) 3000 soldiers around Wildeshausen in 1555, he attracted almost twice as many hopefuls and had to turn the rest away!

But the picture scholars are increasingly painting of the Landsknechte *within* individual companies are notably less egalitarian than the ideal. (To say nothing of Eberlin's accusations of the Landsknecht actual lifestyle of ""whoring, adultery, rape,
gluttony, drunkenness...stealing, robbing, and murder"", or the company of soldiers that randomly burned down the estates they passed on the way to Münster in 1535--or that eager propagandist Graff, above, composed his lyrics *after being blinded*).

First, Landsknechts came from a full range of social classes, from farmhand day labourers up to the nobility. Apparently Emperor Maximilian I had some difficulties wrangling the imperial princes into serving as commanders, but the petty nobility and imperial knights (Reichsritter) were more eager. Niklas Stör's famous series of propagandistic woodcuts features a series of urban artisans who all join the Landsknecht for the money. Landsknecht lyricist Georg Niege, meanwhile, had actually attended and even graduated from the University of Marburg (graduation required significant extra money, to the extent that many university students just went for the coursework and not the degree) before joining up.

And these social stratifications in the ""outside"" world were reflected within the Landsknecht. The famously flamboyant Landsknecht dress code--colorful and stylish and adorned--resulted from imperial decrees excusing them from the sumptuary laws that applied to other Germans. Except--the privilege only applied to Landsknecht of higher ranks. Common soldiers were still banned from wearing slit and slashed (ergo more colorful and adorned) clothing. And ""rank"" meant outside social status, not just military promotion: news Landsknechte from the landed nobility and the urban patriciate typically leapfrogged their lesser-class counterparts in terms of military rank and *especially* pay.

The popularity of Landsknecht service, as suggested above, did raise the barriers for entry. Since there was no standing army and funding was bare minimum (...and company commanders strove to undercut that *even more*, to pocket the rest; Thomas Brady has described the Landsknecht as a multilayer crediting organization who ""made possible wars that no one could afford""), regment commanders and their subrecruiters frequently required that all comers be able to supply their own arms.

We know this was a barrier to entry for many by looking at recruiting patterns from just after the period OP asked about, the second and third quarters of the 16th century. A divide develops in the geographic origins of soldiers by type and rank: more mounted cavalry of higher status and better supplies (e.g. horses) come from central, north, east principalities; lower-paid (ergo lesser-class) infantry were recruited more heavily from the south/southwest. This, of course, was because of the larger number of troops--on both sides--who had armed up to fight in the 1524-25 Peasants' War. They evidently already possessed the tools, and perhaps the skills to fight (although non-propaganda sources are not always as keen on the discipline and prowess of certain Landsknecht companies).

The romance of the Landsknechte endured long after their time in the field. By 1600, ""Landsknecht/Soldat"" dichotomy was popular slang for upstanding versus dishonorable behavior. As the massive bibliography on the Landsknechte that came out of 19th century Germany demonstrates, the legends of brave free men-at-war that emphasized the honor and advanture and minimized the *arson, rape, and murder* resonated with German nationalist and imperial ambitions. And as Matthias Sprenger has demonstrated, the romanticized view of the Landsknecht was directly appropriated by NSDAP (that would be Nazi) publicists and *Freikorps* veterans to legitimize the Nazis' status as the true heirs of the German spirit. It's a sobering lesson to historians to delineate the myth from the ""reality"" of Landsknecht service--but also, to study the power of that myth as a recruiting and propaganda tool in the sixteenth century as well as its later legacy.

790,AskHistorians,"Did any Russian person who was alive for the whole lifespan of the Soviet Union, from the Revolution to the Fall, ever publish any retrospective or opinions on the matter?","There is plenty, plenty more to say on the subject, but one particular person of interest would be Alexander Briansky, who I mention [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9v7pht/if_alive_how_did_participants_in_the_october/e9avfxt/), who was interviewed in the 1990s, and was a participant in the storming of the Winter Palace in the October 1917 Revolution. 

It's worth pointing out that plenty of people would have been alive from around the time of the 1917 Revolutions to the 1990s - that's generally the World War II veteran age. But people that age didn't necessarily have extremely strong memories or understandings of events in their early childhood. One interesting autobiography I can mention of someone who lived this span is Mukhamet Shayakhmetov, who was born in 1922, and wrote a two-volume autobiography *The Silent Steppe* and *A Kazakh Teacher's Story* about his life through the end of the Soviet period (he was writing in the 2010s). Most of the first book focuses on the 1930s famines and World War II, however, with childhood memories of the 1920s.

But if the question is - how many people vividly remembered or played an active role in the 1917 era and were still alive in the post-Soviet period with a sharp mind to analyze current events, that number is much smaller (you're basically looking for centenarians born in the 1890s). Lazar Kaganovich was a major functionary in the Stalin era, and comes close (he was born in 1893 and died July 25, 1991), but seems to have had a serious cognitive decline in his later years and lived in relative obscurity and seclusion, despite the attempts of journalists like David Remnick to interview him. Vyacheslav Molotov (1890 - November 8, 1986) maybe comes closest to what you might be looking for, and was interviewed off and on by Felix Chuev until his death - these collected interviews can be found in English in *Molotov Remembers: Inside Kremlin Politics*. Molotov notably changed his opinion very little, if at all, and even referred to himself as ""a man of the nineteenth century"".

Briansky otherwise is your best bet. Unfortunately, I've looked through the transcript of that particular interview he gave, and found almost nothing asked about his thoughts on the 1990s."
791,AskHistorians,"It's generally taken for granted in sci-fi that a space military would basically be naval, with cruisers and frigates in fleets led by captains and admirals. Given that there has never been a space military, how did this assumption develop?","Space travel was a theme of proto-science fiction like *Les Posthumes* (1802) by Nicolas-Edme Rétif, *Star ou Psi de Cassiopée: Histoire Merveilleuse de l’un des Mondes de l’Espace* (1854) by C. I. Defontenay, and *Lumen* (1872) by Camille Flammarion, but these stories lacked any strong scientific understanding of what space was like or what space travel entailed. Some of the first actual fiction to deal with the actual science of potential space travel was Jules Verne's *De la Terre à la Lune, trajet direct en 97 heures 20 minutes* (1865) and its sequel *Autour de la Lune* (1869), which had the Baltimore Gun Club use a massive space gun to overcome gravity; H. G. Wells got in on the act with *The War of the Worlds* (1897), which involves projectile-ships, and *The First Men in the Moon* (1900-1901), where a gravity-negating mineral facilitates the travel.

In these early examples, the Earth-travelers are explicitly civilian, and the format of the story is that of the adventure-romance, a mode of fiction that would become known as *scientific romance*. Fiction of this genre would not always even bother with physical vessels for interplanetary travel; Edgar Rice Burroughs' *A Princess of Mars* (1912) involves a kind of transposition of bodies through space, much like Mark Twain's *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court* (1889), and E. R. Eddison in *The Worm Ouroboros* (1922) used the same basic idea for his fantasy world (nominally Mercury).

Wells' *War of the Worlds* would involve an *invading* extraterrestrial force, but this not based explicitly on contemporary military structures, but a sort of inversion of invasion literature, where the technologically inferior Earth-forces are faced with a numerically inferior but technologically superior foe.

""Future war"" fiction was another proto-science fiction mode, with close parallels to Yellow Peril literature and the like, and here we get closer to what might be the actual answer to your question. An unauthorized sequel to *War of the Worlds*, *Edison's Conquest of Mars* (1898) has the Earthlings repay the favor by invading Mars, with ""Ships of Space"" powered by a reverse-engineered Martian anti-gravity device and armed with disintegrator rays, and the immediate parallel is navel vessels:

> From the northeast, their great guns flashing in the sunlight and their huge funnels belching black volumes that rested like thunder clouds upon the sea, came the mighty warships of England, with her meteor flag streaming red in the breeze, while the royal insignia, indicating the presence of the ruler of the British Empire, was conspicuously displayed upon the flagship of the squadron.

By the same token, *The Struggle for Empire: A Story of the Year 2236* (1900) by Robert William Cole is basically the contemporary British Empire with its ships and fleets and colonies projected into space...and I mean that quite literally, it replicates the entire command structure of a naval fleet:

> Early in the morning of the 12th of May, in the year 2237, the vast space of ground where the interstellar fleet lay drawn up was a scene of great bustle and excitement. The last preparations were being made, for in a few hours they were to dash off into space. The vessels were drawn up in long lines, being arranged in divisions, with the flag-ship of each division in the middle, and the other ships lying on either side of it according to their size and qualities. The flag-ship of the Admiral-in-Chief was floating about a hundred yards in the air, the Union Jack flying from one of its masts [...]

Not every story involving space-travel involved vessels, and not every vessel was military, but those that were military in this early period tended to be follow military lines of thinking - and there are real-life parallels to this, in the command structure of civilian merchant ships and (eventually) practical air travel.

The simile was sometimes carried over in other ways. ""Space Marines"" for example are first mentioned in ""Captain Brink of the Space Marines"" (1932) and ""The Space Marines and the Slavers"" (1936) by Bob Olsen; they rose to prominence with the space-transported mobile mechanized infantry in *Starship Soldier* (later *Starship Troopers*, 1959) by Robert Heinlein, which would in turn inspired the colonial marines of the film *Aliens* (1986).

In a lot of ways, it's fair to say that the idea of imagining space military forces based around terrestrial military organizations and forces is inherently flawed; writers and artists were drawing on what they knew - and as warfare changed and developed socially and technologically, this continued (and continues) to be true. The Star Destroyer from the opening of *Star Wars* (1977) is essentially an aircraft carrier in space, carrying multiple smaller attack craft (TIE Fighters) which attack or sortie in small squadrons, and which provide air cover for ground troops and mechanized infantry during assaults, as they did in *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980). The Vietnam War proved influential on David Drake's *Hammer's Slammers* (1979), reflecting his experience in the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment.

Not all science fiction has explicitly followed this model; the military forces of *Dune* for example include both the presence of tactical nuclear weapons *and* effective deterrents; the initial stages of the military aspect of the conflict thus involve both references to traditional medieval siege and later 20th-century-style guerrilla warfare. The lack of specific military spacecraft (given the Spacing Guild monopoly) means that much of the rank-structure and organization is based on army ranks and command."
792,AskHistorians,Why did Hitler not invade Switzerland?,"I wrote about this quite some time ago, and while it was tilted more at the angle of how 'true' Swiss neutrality was, a good deal of the answer to *that* question involves looking at cooperation with Germany which is an important part of answering your on inquiry here. As such, I'll repost that old answer here for you (with a bit of cleanup)!

During World War II, the Swiss were neutral and generally speaking maintained that position, meaning that they did not declare war or offer military assistance to either power, and while they traded, even in goods that had military purposes, they did not openly favor one side over the other (which would have given them ""non-belligerent"" status, such as in the case of Sweden and Finland in 1939-1940, although I would note that isn't so much a proper term as Neutral). But, that isn't to say they did nothing. The Swiss practiced armed neutrality, meaning they mobilized for possible (defensive) war, and in conducting their trade, courted several controversies. Germany certainly loomed as a threat in some respects, and they considered whether or not to invade, but in the end, it there is little evidence to suggest such an action was imminent, and plenty to point to the idea that Germany was better off with a free, but cooperative Switzerland than one they controlled but had suffered the ravages of war. Anyways though...

**Call Up**

When war broke out on September 1st, Switzerland mobilized quicker than the Allied powers. Over 400,000 men of the militia-based Swiss Army had reported to their post within 48 hours of Germany crossing the Polish border, quicker than either France or the UK! This meant that roughly 10 percent of the country was now under arms, and an additional 500,000 or so men and women were in auxiliary organizations such as the FHD, or otherwise in a job that gave direct assistance to the military.

The Swiss military is quite famous for how they are organized around mandatory service, and at the time of World War II, the professional core of the military was tiny - made up mostly of border guards, pilots, and a small cadre of staff officers who kept things running. For the general population, marksmanship was encouraged and cultivated for boys, and when they reached the age of 20, they had a three-month basic training course and were issued a uniform and a rifle - [A K31 straight-pull rifle](http://candrsenal.com/rifle-swiss-karabiner-1931/) by that point, although older reservists would possibly have a Schmidt-Rubin K11. They now were in the active reserve (""Miliz"") until the age of 48, which required that they took a three-week refresher course every year, after which they ""retired"" to the inactive reserve (Meaning they weren't going to be immediately called up, and didn't need to do the refresher, but still expected to in time of great need). Especially talented individuals could be nominated for the advanced course in alpine warfare, which was another three months, and would allow them to join the elite Mountain Brigades. With the mass call up in 1939 though, the retirement age was temporarily pushed back to 60, and new inductees now underwent a four month course, and those who had been called up began training on a full time basis.

Aside from the nation-in-arms model, the Swiss also had built their country to brace for the worst. Bridges, railways, tunnels, and other infrastructure were made for easy mining, and roads had pre-built holes for the placement of anti-tank stakes. In the event of invasion, 100,000 border troops were to fight a delaying action, blowing up everything they could as they fell back, while critical things were evacuated southwards, and the bulk of the Swiss forces moved into the highly defensible National Redoubt high in the Alps, where Swiss planners believed they could hold off German attacks indefinitely. The plan would of course mean turning over much of the country to the invader, and laying waste to it as well - denying use of infrastructure by the occupier, but also crippling the Swiss themselves were they to retake the land - but at least, they hoped, they could cost whoever chose to violate their neutrality dearly.

**1940**

For the first few months, very little happened, not just in Switzerland, but on the Franco-German frontier as well - a period known as the ""Phony War"", or the ""Sitzkrieg"". But that didn't mean that Switzerland was twiddling their collective thumbs. The greatest fear at that point was of a violation of the Swiss border for a southern sweep into France around the Maginot Line. The geography of the Alps might protect the 'heart of Switzerland' from a direct invasion, to a degree, but the ""Swiss Plateau"" is considerably more usable for military operations, especially if your end goal is entering France. When the Germans in fact launched *Fall Gelb* through the Low Countries to the North instead, Switzerland hardly breathed a sigh of relief. Intelligence that they had collected pointed to a German plan to launch a complimentary attack just as they had feared, to be initiated on May 15th. Nothing came to pass of this. There had been some build up, but it was just an exercise, although the purpose may have been to make the French *think* that was the intent so as to divert forces south.

As we all know, France fell quickly. The immediate effect of this was a massive influx of soldiers in flight. About 30,000 Frenchmen crossed the border and laid down their arms. They would be interned by the Swiss for a few months, until an agreement was reached for their repatriation to France in early 1941. 13,000 Polish soldiers also ended up there, having been serving in France, but they were not repatriated during the war, and instead interned for the duration at several camps. They were utilized for various labor projects such as draining swampland for farming, and after the war most either returned to Poland, or left for some other country, but roughly 1,000 chose to settle in Switzerland.

It wasn't just soldiers though. Thousands upon thousands of refugees, including French Jews, also were making their way to the border. Fearful of being overloaded, very strict quotas were set, and entry was refused to many with the infamous explanation that the ""lifeboat is full"". 7,000 Jews had already been given entry prior to the war, and not many more were initially to be allowed. The sight of several committing suicide when refused entry caused many guards to start turning a blind eye, and eventually there was some liberalization to the refugee policy, but it nevertheless fell very short. While roughly 20,000 Jewish persons were included in the several hundred thousand refugees and internees who found shelter in Switzerland, about an equal number were turned away at the border. While the Swiss plead that their small country could only handle so many refugees, many both at the time and in decades since assert that a significantly higher number could have been reasonably accommodated (As well as criticizing the treatment of those who were allowed in. The Swiss billed them for room and board, which was deducted from any money that had brought into the country - which the Swiss had made them turn over for ""safe keeping"". If they couldn't pay, the Swiss later sent bills to the governments of France and Belgium and the Netherlands for the cost after the war).

More so though, the completion of the German invasion of France meant that the immediate threat of invasion was lessened. For some, including President Pilet-Golaz, this meant *Erneuerung* and *Anpassung* (Renewal and adaptation), or that is to say, coming to terms with the new European order and attempting to find Switzerland's place in it. One of the first steps towards this was to demobilize 2/3 of the Swiss Army on Pilet-Golaz's orders, with little secret that it was in order to not antagonize Germany needlessly. It isn't at all a stretch to call the decision controversial. There wasn't much outright Nazi sympathies in Switzerland, and while many might have understood the pragmatic requirements given Switzerland's location, sympathies were generally with the Allies. As a popular saying went, ""we work for the Germans six days a week, and pray for the Allies on the seventh."" As such, the move went against the Swiss self-image and hurt Swiss morale, even if they were somewhat in denial.

The worst hit in the morale department were the Army. In reaction, General Guisan brought 650 Swiss officers to Lake Lucerne, where the old Confederacy had been founded, and gave them a stirring speech about absolute resistance to any invasion, and had them all swear oaths to fight to the end if it happened. It was a great piece of political theater if nothing else, and a major boost to restore Swiss confidence. But again, as I note... the Swiss were a bit in denial.

793,AskHistorians,"The war in Europe ended in May 1945, just a few months before the atomic bomb was ready for use. Was there an expressed or recorded sense of stunned relief from imprisoned Nazi leadership after the atomic bombs were used on Japan? Did they ever feel Germany had just dodged the biggest bullet ever?","Since no one else has chimed in, did a quick review of the Nuremberg lit to confirm my recollection was correct, and the answer is pretty much no.

There were a few things going on.  First, as /u/restricteddata or others can discuss in far better detail than I, the actual details of what the bombings did were fairly closely held for years beyond immediate death tolls and (to an extent) surface damage.  About the last people in the world who were privy to the more gruesome aspects to it were those held at Nuremberg and elsewhere.

By and large, this led to a general view of atomic weapons by most strategic thinkers for a few years after the war as merely a much more powerful and compact version of the strategic bombing that had already defined World War II.  The Nazi leadership certainly subscribed to this, and had no problems comparing the Allied raids carried out by Spaatz and Harris' air forces to their own crimes, far lesser in their minds:

>Frank to Rosenburg: ""They are trying to pin the murder of 2,000 Jews a day in Auschwitz on Kaltenbrunner—but what about the 30,000 people who were killed in the bombing attacks on Hamburg in a few hours?—They were also mostly women and children.—And how about the 80,000 deaths from the atomic bombing in Japan?—Is that justice too?""

Where the atomic bomb came up more often was in the grand view of politics the leadership continued to assess from afar, where most of their interest was in what the development of the bomb would do to US-Soviet relations:

>Ribbentrop had his first good laugh in several weeks at the reviewer's comment that Bullitt is in favor of using the atomic bomb ""to scare the pants off Russia."" As Ribbentrop translated the comment that Russia was only waiting to develop its own atomic bomb to attack us, Goering replied expansively, ""Why, of course, every child in the street knows that— anybody who has the slightest political knowledge ... I give them about 5 years' time.""

>They did not talk about it very much in my presence, but from their smug grins, it was easy to see that they received no small delight from this sign of tension between America and Russia.

This was also - give or take - the relative position of the few people in Nazi leadership who had some idea about their own atomic weapon development, which was that with a focus on plutonium, it wasn't likely to be something that might affect the outcome of the war, but it had a good chance if it succeeded of determining the balance of power after it.

Of those at Nuremberg, only Speer was a member of that group from the spring of 1942 onwards when he transferred out Heisenberg and his group from the Education Ministry to Goering's (relative) oversight and kept some tabs on what they were doing.  He had a far less sanguine view of what might happen down the road,

>Speer turned from his defense to warn the world of the destruction we might expect in a future war: radio-controlled rockets, aircraft flying at supersonic speed, and atomic bombs, destroying everything within reach; chemical and bacteriological warfare snuffing out all life that remained.

However, even in the extensive interviews with Sereny and his extensive writings, we don't really see him expressing much of a feeling that Germany had dodged a bullet.  It's more that he felt the world faced a much heavier caliber one than it had ever dealt with before.

All this said, there may have been those outside the higher leadership that expressed opinions on it later (or were recorded at Trent Park), but as best as we can tell, the bottom line is that the highest leadership didn't really consider it much worse than had already happened to them anyway.

794,AskHistorians,"In 490 BC a Spartan army marched 220 kilometres in three days for the Battle of Marathon. It is over 70 kilometers per day, without roads, socks and boots. Do we know more about the march and the condition they arrived at the battlefield in?","When the Athenians heard of the Persian landing at Marathon, they sent the messenger Pheidippides to Sparta to ask for help. The Spartans promised to come to the aid of the Athenians, but claimed that they could not do so right away, because it was the 9th day of a new month, and the law said they could not go to war until the moon was full (apparently it was the sacred month of the Karneia, when such rules applied). This happened on the 15th day of the month, and that day the Spartans sent 2000 men to Athens. Though they marched in all haste, they arrived too late, and the battle had already been won.

This whole subplot is a sideshow to the actual battle of Marathon in our main source, the *Histories* by Herodotos of Halikarnassos. He only mentions the Spartan march briefly and says nothing about the conditions of the march or the state of the 2000 Spartans at the end of it:

> After the full moon two thousand Lakedaimonians came to Athens, making such great haste to reach it that they were in Attika on the third day after leaving Sparta. Although they came too late for the battle, they desired to see the Medes, so they went to Marathon and saw them. Then they departed again, praising the Athenians and their achievement.

-- Herodotos 6.120

That's all Herodotos has to say about the Spartan reinforcements. They came, they saw, they left. Spartan observance of sacred law meant that they missed the battle, and the Athenians and Plataians were forced to fight alone. Plutarch argued that the story about the full moon was made up by Herodotos, since the battle actually took place on the 6th day of the month, and the Spartans very nearly made it on time (*On the Malice of Herodotos* 26). Scholars have not been able to work out the correct date for the battle and resolve the conflict between Herodotos and Plutarch; either way, though, the Spartans missed the fight.

In any case, even if the Spartans had arrived on time, 2000 men did not make a very substantial force. The Athenians themselves are said to have deployed 9000, with tiny Plataiai providing another 1000 which probably amounted to its entire hoplite levy. The Spartans could have sent many more troops; clearly they didn't care enough to do what they could to save Athens from subjection to Persia. The army they sent to Athens may not have been as pathetic a token force as the 1000 men they sent to Thermopylai 10 years later, but it showed a similar reluctance to commit real numbers to any campaign outside the Peloponnese.

On the other hand, this Spartan indifference to the fate of Athens doesn't match the apparent speed of their march. The fact that the Spartans covered about 220km in 3 days* suggests that they really were doing everything in their power to make their small numbers count. Forced marches were not a regular feature of Greek warfare, and Greek armies weren't known to move anywhere near as quickly as this one. Even if we take into account that a force of just 2000 men could have done with much less of a baggage train and merchant entourage than most Greek armies, it's still true that they moved exceptionally quickly. Leonidas' 1000 Spartans seem to have taken up to two weeks to get from Sparta to Thermopylai. How do we explain the speed of the troops sent to Marathon?

The bad faith answer would be that the Spartans deliberately waited until they were reasonably sure they would be late, and then made a show of rushing north to Athens because they knew they weren't going to be fighting but needed to convince their allies that they were willing to. The good faith answer was the one given by Herodotos, that the Spartans' hands were tied by religious law but they did what they could to make up for lost time when their supporting troops finally marched out.

But both these explanations assume that the march really happened, regardless of what a typical Greek army was capable of. The alternative answer is that the forced march never took place; that the Spartans promised Pheidippides that they would help Athens, but took their time getting the troops together, and marched out at a leisurely pace. How did Herodotos know that the Spartans spent 6 days waiting for the moon and then marched for 3 days? Could it be because that's the story the Spartans spread upon their arrival? Several scholars have argued that the march of 220-260km in 3 days is physically impossible; J.P. Holoka ('Marathon and the myth of the same-day march', *GRBS* 38 (1997) 338-353) rejects it completely and insists that the Spartans would have needed at least 8 days to cover the distance.

This theory may seem unfair to the Spartans, but they definitely engaged in creative retellings of this kind. For the Thermopylai campaign, Herodotos again claims that the Karneia got in the way of the mobilisation, so the Spartans couldn't send reinforcements to Leonidas. But a close look at the chronology of the campaign shows that this is a lie. There was actually plenty of time for them to send troops before the sacred period began; the Spartans simply chose not to. Herodotos is covering for them. It's not that radical to suggest that they used the Karneia in 490 BC as an excuse not to march out at all, or to do so in their own time, and not run the risk of having to fight the Persians.

---

*) It's worth noting that we can mess around with the numbers to make them less impressive. Herodotos' claim that the Spartans arrived ""on the third day after they left"" could arguably mean ""on the fourth day of their march"". If we take literally his statement that they ""were in Attika"" that day, as in, they just crossed the border rather than arriving in Athens (let alone at Marathon), this further reduces the distance by some 20km. So perhaps the distance covered was only 50km per day rather than 70km. Others have suggested that the distance was only border-to-border, whittling it down even further, to perhaps 160km in 3 days.

---

EDIT: just wanted to add that the Ancient Greeks definitely did have roads, socks and boots.

EDIT 2: added some bits to reflect scholarly debate over this march. For the state of the art in scholarship, see P. Krentz, *Marathon* (2010), and C.D. Dionysopoulos, *The Battle of Marathon* (trans. N. Wardle, 2015)."
795,AskHistorians,How did Richard I come to be so fondly lionized in British cultural memory given how marginal of a King he seems to have actually been?,"The story of Richard the Lionheart's perception by the British public is a long and complicated one. He has always been controversial, and opinion has generally swung on a pendulum between harsh condemnation as a vagabond who didn't bother to rule England verses a lionised hero who led the Third Crusade and *nearly* won. So here's the basics of why. 

Richard's father, Henry II, had been a strong king but also a controversial one for his own long and complicated list of reasons - he had almost been overthrown in a rebellion led by his own children, including Richard. When Richard I was crowned there was hope that he would be a steady ruler and keep his slippery brother John under control. His coronation degenerated into an anti-semitic riot in the streets of London, and that rather set the tone. 

In his own day Richard was not particularly loved, other than when he was freed from captivity, which was met with widespread celebration. Numerous sources, including people who personally knew him, openly describe him as an asshole even by medieval standards. He was a serial rapist, his marriage was dysfunctional and so lacking in love that the pope publicly called him out on it, he had little regard for the lower classes of society, he killed prisoners, he (allegedly) had people assassinated including the king-elect of Jerusalem, and he was known to be difficult to work with (a shock given what I just told you, I know). We know him as 'the Lionheart' but during his lifetime he was also known as 'Oc-e-Non', which in Occitan means 'yes and no'; a reference to his terseness. He was cruel and difficult. 

The Third Crusade, for which he is best known, was a mixed affair for Richard's reputation. On the one hand, he had led the counter attack against Saladin, who was rightfully perceived as the greatest threat to Christian dominion over the Holy Land in living memory. On the other hand, he delayed going (for which he was attacked by the famous troubadour Bertran de Born) and... he lost. There's no getting around the fact that he did not fulfil his crusading vow by visiting Jerusalem. The decision to leave was his call, and almost his call alone - his men even mutinied against him and I can't emphasise how rare that was in the Middle Ages. Whilst he was away, king Philip II of France invaded Normandy and his brother John attempted to expand his personal domains in England and potentially seize the throne and, because Richard was thought to have had the king-elect of Jerusalem assassinated, he was imprisoned on his way home by the duke of Austria, who he'd been such an asshole to on the Third Crusade that most of the remaining German contingent departed because they couldn't stand him. His ransom nearly bankrupted England and he spent a year unable to fight back against John and Phillip so lost chunks of Normandy to the French that would never be securely recovered. He cocked up royally. 

Then a few years later he was shot in the collar and killed by a teenager because he was too busy taunting a guy defending a castle with a frying pan to spot the kid lining up a crossbow on him. 

From what I've just written, you might be wondering why anyone remembers him positively at all given that he messed up so much. 

He did have some things going for him. He dazzled contemporaries with his brilliance in war, thanks partly to Roman military doctrine laid out in Vegetius' *De Re Militari*, a late Roman treatise on warfare. Richard wasn't so much interested in battle tactics - his army was no Roman legion, not even close - but in training and logistics he took a lot on board from Vegetius. Crusades in particular had been blighted by poor logistical preparation but Richard had a solid grasp of what was needed. He prepared flat-pack trebuchets that he could ferry to the Holy Land, he conquered Cyprus in part to secure a supply of food and money to support the crusade, he successfully worked out how to counter Saladin's tactics, but he also viewed the crusade as a personal battle between himself and Saladin and lost sight of the mission. Commenting on Richard's qualities, the historian Stephen Runciman put it eloquently: ""he was a bad son, a bad husband, and a bad king, but a gallant and splendid soldier""

He was also good at delegating. Richard has been infamous in history for not speaking English and not taking an interest in the running of the kingdom. These were not criticisms levied at him in his lifetime (u/CoeurdeLionne goes into more detail below). Henry II had created a centralised government in Westminster that handled the daily affairs of state and Richard left them to it. They were nothing special, but it kept the kingdom in safe-ish hands. 

So he was a good military leader, and his lack of interest in politics turned out to be a good thing, but why the lionisation? 

Nostalgia is powerful, especially in a time of great difficulty. We think 'well the current time is bad, so the before time must have been at least a bit good', and this was essentially what happened to Richard's reputation. The problems of Richard's reign were pretty small compared to John's. John's reign was so bad we got the beginnings of constitutional monarchy (through Magna Carta) to restrain the worst of it. People looked back on Richard favourably as a result. John was intrusive in the affairs of state and routinely overruled the civil servants that had competently run the kingdom in Richard's absence. His disrespect for the barons led to civil wars, and the trouble they caused both to the aristocracy and the common folk. 

In the years after John's death, literature emerged praising those nostalgic days before John ruined everything. In late medieval stories like the early Robin Hood tales, John was invariably an antagonist. In any story set while Richard was away on crusade, Richard was cast as the just ruler undermined by his nefarious brother. Robin Hood is the most famous example but there were plenty such tales in circulation. As I've described, there's a lot of truth to that portrayal, and writers seized on it as way to further vilify John. 

Furthermore, Richard's battles against Saladin had all the elements of a naturally excellent story. It was two great leaders facing off against each other in a great struggle for the future of the Holy Land, and Richard was without a doubt its hero. In particular, the Battle of Jaffa showed him to be a mighty warrior; he led the vanguard personally and cut down dozens of Saladin's men,  wielded a crossbow with great accuracy, and then utterly crushed Saladin's army in it's last charge. It wasn't just his own court poets writing about him like this either,the Muslim sources also describe him as a terrifyingly good warrior who always led from the front. To round off the victory, Richard mounted a horse and rode down the front of Saladin's line taunting his men, *and nobody dared to attack him*. He was great, and he knew it. He had been occasionally called 'the Lionheart' before the Battle of Jaffa, but afterwards it defined his memory in popular culture. 

Against the backdrop of John's terrible reign, and the controversial reign of Henry III (John's son, who lost secure possession of all Normandy and was deemed so bad there was a revolution against him in 1258 that saw him entirely removed from government for a few years), Richard became a figure representative of the time before all the problems. People latched onto those people who defied the misery of John and Henry, Richard was one, another was William Marshall - eulogised as the greatest knight of all time. Compared to the difficulties of the 13th century, the reign of Richard looked positively peachy. And as crusades continued to fail badly, his limited success  became more praiseworthy as people realised what an achievement it was to even win a battle in the Holy Land. 

Richard's lionisation was not (imo) mainly down to his own merits as a ruler, because as king he got a lot wrong. But compared to the trash fire that was England in the 13th century, Richard looked great and was an emblem of the before times when England had a chivalric king who took on Saladin and achieved more than anyone else did. Poets of the later Middle Ages celebrated his military achievements and forgot his misdeeds, in part because John was worse in many respects, and because it made for a better story. After all, rapists and murderers don't make for sympathetic protagonists. 

Finally, I'd like to point out that Richard was not always lionised. There's a statue of him outside Parliament in London, awkwardly away from the road where nobody can really see it. It's there because MPs could not decide whether they wanted to venerate Richard or not, and ordered the statue before deciding where to put it because they loved the work of the artist (who had produced an earlier clay version). So they stuck it in a corner as a compromise. An often quoted passage on Richard comes from William Stubbs, who offers a damning picture of Richard that was pretty common for its day: 

> He was a bad king: his great exploits, his military skill, his splendour and extravagance, his poetical tastes, his adventurous spirit, do not serve to cloak his entire want of sympathy, or even consideration, for his people. He was no Englishman, but it does not follow that he gave to Normandy, Anjou, or Aquitaine the love or care that he denied to his kingdom. His ambition was that of a mere warrior: he would fight for anything whatever, but he would sell everything that was worth fighting for.

So he has not always been lionised, and u/CoeurdeLionne goes into more detail on this in his excellent answer below. I'd also recommend John Gillingham's biography of Richard for how his reputation has fluctuated.

How did they arrive, and how long was it before they became an integral part of the cuisine?","Hiya, I couldn't find a *single* previous thread that addressed your questions. However, combining two of them will cover the Indian angle of the question:

797,AskHistorians,"How did almost every ""ancient"" culture(e.g. China, aztecs, greece and other indian tribes) develop the idea of dragons independently? What is similar in all dragons across cultures, and which cultural understanding of dragons has shaped the modern idea of dragons the most?","I'm not a historian, but a paleontologist, and I don't know if my response is allowed but I wanted to add my two cents before the usual explanation I hear gets posted. Many people posit that dragon myths are derived from cultures finding dinosaur bones in the ground, recognizing them as the remains of giant reptilian creatures, and developing myths of dragons.

I find this very, very unlikely, in most circumstances at least. There are two issues I see; 1) dinosaur fossils are usually found in remote areas with difficult terrain, and 2) dinosaur fossils are very difficult to recognize unless you're specifically looking for them.

Fossils occur in sedimentary rock layers, which need to be exposed through weathering at the surface for people to find them. Vegetation obscures fossils from sight and root action can break them apart, so arid areas are especially good for locating fossils.  Therefore, dinosaur fossils tend to be found in rugged badlands or deserts that are sparsely inhabited or traversed. The major fossil localities of the present day - the badlands of the Western U.S. and Canada, the Gobi desert, and the Sahara - were probably little explored by people from the cultures you are asking about.

More important, however, is that dinosaur fossils are barely recognizable in the ground to all but the trained eye. In movies, they're always present as fully articulated and complete specimens, in perfect relief against the rock. In reality, the vast majority of dinosaur remains are isolated bones or fragments of bone, which are often damaged by weathering from the surrounding rock matrix (which is how paleontologists locate new finds in the first place). They are usually not bone-colored, instead taking a new color from the mineral content of their matrix (North American fossils tend to be dark brown, for example). Unless you know the appearance of bone in a region, it will be exceedingly difficult to even tell bone fragments apart from the rock, and even more difficult to tell what an isolated fragment of bone came from without a robust understanding of comparative anatomy. There's a reason that paleontology was one of the last sciences to develop - it's predicated upon knowledge of both geologic processes and comparative anatomy, without which it is impossible to interpret most fossil remains. 

For these reasons, I find it exceedingly unlikely that fossil remains were the inspiration for any mythological creatures, save for possibly cyclopes, as the pygmy elephant skulls on which they may have been based were subfossils that were easily accessible to Mediterranean peoples. Dinosaur fossils in particular are so inaccessible and difficult to recognize that I am very skeptical of any claim that they are the root of dragon myths around the world.

Some sources:
http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/6858 - peer-reviewed journal article (open access at the link) from last year that includes several field photos. What's interesting to note here is that these specimens are exceptionally complete and have white fossil bone (only found in the Gobi to my knowledge), and are still barely recognizable as bones, rather than white pebbles, in the field. 

Michael Benton, *Vertebrate Paleontology*, 3rd Edition (Blackwell Publishing) - a textbook about paleontology in general, and includes a chapter on the discovery and collection fossils, detailing the geographic areas where fossils are generally found and what types of rocks they are found in.

Adrienne Mayor, *The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times* (Princeton University Press) - for the opposing argument. This seems to be the work from which a great deal of modern speculation about the fossil origins of mythological creatures is derived. She details arguments about the role of pygmy elephants in cyclops myths, among others. One claim of hers I find particularly untenable is that *Protoceratops* fossils were the inspiration for the gryphon in Greek mythology - *Protoceratops* fossils are common but restricted to Mongolia, so it seems very unlikely that the Greeks would have ever seen one."
798,AskHistorians,"Grover Cleveland was acting president and 49 years old when he married his 21-year-old wife, who he also watched over before their marriage after her father died. Was this not objectively considered gross or weird at the time?","I wrote my master's thesis in history on Frances Cleveland and public perceptions of her role as first lady. One of the chapters focused on the wedding of Grover Cleveland and Frances Folsom, and in researching this portion I read as much newspaper and magazine coverage as I could get access to. This included major papers such as the *New York Times*, the *New York Tribune*, the *Chicago Daily News,* and the Washington D.C. *Evening Star*. I also examined popular mass-circulation magazines, including *Ladies Home Journal, Harpers Bazar, Puck,* and *Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspapers*. 

All of these publications devoted extensive space to the White House wedding, and in none of them did I encounter any hint that there was anything strange about the pairing of Grover Cleveland and Frances Folsom. In fact, the general sentiment was summed up by an article in the *New York Tribune* (titled ""Mr. Cleveland's Devotion to His Ward"") that described it as ""like a story book or fairy tale."" Up until the announcement of the engagement, Cleveland had had a reputation for being rather gruff and unsociable, and people seem to have been genuinely charmed by the revelation of his romantic side. As one writer for the *Chicago Daily News* observed:

""There is something characteristically American about the merry yet respectful, jesting yet sincere, interest our people take in the nuptials of the president. Every bit of gossip concerning his courtship and the life, appearance, and character of his intended is discussed with as much avidity as if she were to be the bride of some personal friend. The people do not stand afar off and watch the preparations for the marriage as if it were to be a pageant of royalty. They are not restrained by any awe of the president's high office from showing their curiosity about his persona affairs. They feel that he owes his elevation to their suffrage, and they wish him joy and tender him advice with all the freedom of equals.""

Of course, this was just what was being said publicly, but I have no reason to think private opinion was drastically different. Frances was an enormously popular figure throughout Cleveland's first term in office, and she was joyfully welcomed back to the White House in 1892. By that time the Clevelands had a daughter, Ruth, and would welcome a second child in 1893, completing the picture of domestic felicity."
799,AskHistorians,Taiwan and South Korea were brutal dictatorships until the 80s. Now they are shining models of democracy in Asia. What happened?,"I'm going to highlight a wider geopolitical point that hasn't been mentioned here:

China affirmatively switched sides in the Cold War with the 1979 signing of the Joint Communiqué. Arms sales and military cooperation began the same year.

The main impact is that US allies along the Chinese periphery were no longer so critical, and American support was no longer guaranteed. At the same time, with the start of Evil Empire/National Endowment for Democracy rhetoric in the US with regards to Eastern Europe from 1983 onwards, these regimes were both more costly and less useful to support.

The impact of this shift was not felt first in Korea or in Taiwan, but in the Philippines: in 1986, Ferdinand Marcos called an election after years of heavy American media pressure. The media, in particular the New York Times, would be heavily critical of Marcos's misuse of American aid funding and pitched Marcos as endangering US military interests by perpetuating conditions conducive to armed revolution. Marcos sought to present himself to the Americans as the only alternative to communist dictatorship, but the US State Department under Reagan pursued a ""third force"" strategy of propping up moderate reformists who would be credible leaders of an urban protest movement and win democratic elections. Michael Armacost, a former ambassador to the Philllppines who had now been promoted to State, described the strategy as ""to encourage the democratic forces of the center, then consolidate control by the middle [classes] and also win away the soft support of the [communists] [by]... cueing in initiatives pushed by the business class and the middle classes... [who] are the ultimate arbiter of succession"". 

Likewise, in Korea, we can see the evolution in US policy by comparing the US response to Gwangju in 1979 and to the protests in 1987. When Chun Doo-Hwan first declared martial law in 1980, the US response was to issue a statement. In contrast, in June 1987, when Chun sought to deploy troops to the campuses, the US ambassador James Lilley informed Chun that to do so would threaten the US-ROK alliance (""This is the American position. The [US military] command is with me. I speak for all of the United States.""). By the evening the same day, Chun suspended the mobilization."
800,AskHistorians,Was anybody in 1952 worried about the ascension of the 25-year old Queen Elizabeth II to the British throne?,"Seeing the mass of deleted comments, I'm somewhat hesitant to attempt to answer this myself, but I'm sure the mods will delete it if it's not up to snuff.

I think the key thing to bear in mind is that by 1952 the monarchy had undergone a serious image transformation since the ascension of Elizabeth II's great-great Grandmother, Victoria, at the age of 18 in 1837.

By comparison to Elizabeth, Victoria's claim on the throne was far more removed. Victoria was the only child of King George III's fourth born son, her three uncles, George IV, Prince Frederick, and William IV all died leaving no legitimate children. Victoria's father, Prince Edward had died in 1820, 17 years before Victoria became Queen.

When Victoria did succeed her uncle she was unmarried and, to make matters worse, owing to the laws governing the German titles that had been in her family since George I 1714, all the Hanoverian titles went to her fairly unpopular uncle, the fifth son of George III, [Ernest Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Augustus_I_of_Hanover) creating a new German royal family. If there were any monarch of the last 300 years that would have faced massive opposition upon succession, it would have been Victoria, but even she was enormously popular in her early reign.

The thing about the (modern) Monarchy is only most legitimate choice succeeds the throne. There may well have been those concerned about Victoria becoming Queen, but what other options did they have? The only viable potential candidate left was the elderly Ernest Augustus, whose track record of [conservatism and political agitation](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ernest-Augustus-king-of-Hanover) left a lot of people, including the Duke of Wellington, with a very low opinion of him.

Compare that to the succession of Elizabeth after the death of her father, George VI* in 1952. Her father, the second born son of George V, was not expected to succeed the throne, but after his elder brother abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson in 1936, he became King. George VI was a very popular king, and his prioritizing of his family meant they became very popular too. Whereas before the focus had been more on the King himself, George VI brought his family in to share the spotlight. As a result of this loosening of royal protocol, the royal family became much more like the one we see today, often photographed in more [informal situations](http://st3.cricketcountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Princess-Elizabeth-the-future-Queen-Elizabeth-II-conversing-with-her-father-King-George-VI-1895-1952-in-a-garden.jpg), compared with the ultra-formal attitude of his father, [George V](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5499/11682897433_35d0c8c600_b.jpg). You also probably know that the Royal family [remained in Buckingham Palace during WWII despite the Blitz](http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/TheHouseofWindsor/GeorgeVI.aspx) and often [visited bombed areas in South London,](http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/70075.jpg) further boosting their popularity. [Princess Elizabeth also trained as an ambulance driver and quasi-mechanic](http://www.express.co.uk/pictures/galleries/2955/Queen-Elizabeth-II-World-War-II-pictures/Queen-Elizabeth-II-driving-an-ambulance-during-her-wartime-service-in-the-Auxiliary-Territorial-Service-on-10th-April-1945-65562) during the war, boosting her image enormously. 

After the War, Elizabeth went on to marry Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten in 1947. Philip was the former Prince of Greece and nephew of one of the most distinguished commanders during WWII, the former chief of Combined Operations, the former Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asia, and last Viceroy of India, [Lord Louis Mountbatten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma), himself a grandson of Queen Victoria. Not only was the match a very well made one, but it came during a time of massive post-war austerity. Rationing was still enforced, and the genera mood of the country was depressed. The Royal marriage, as it so often does, provided a welcome distraction and a reason for people all over the Empire to celebrate.

By the time George VI died in early 1952, the Royal family was about as popular as they could be. When it came time for Elizabeth to ascend the throne the public had a little over 15 years of knowing she would succeed her father, so it was not as jarring as perhaps Victoria's was. She was the daughter of a very popular king, and a very popular Princess in her own right. She had a good husband, and two children of her own, Prince Charles and Princess Anne**. Again, the question must be asked, what alternative was there? The only other close claimant to the throne was her younger sister, Princess Margaret. George VI's younger brother, [Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Henry,_Duke_of_Gloucester) remained, but he had always been a private man, preferring the soldiers life to one in the limelight.

**TL;DR**

By the time Princess Elizabeth became Queen Elizabeth, the Royal family was incredibly popular, she had a good husband, and the country had been prepared for her ascension for over 15 years.

801,AskHistorians,How significant was ass in the beauty or sexual standard of ancient Rome? What was the average size?,"Well, this is an...interesting question. But I'll do my best to answer with a ssingle pun. 

Our knowledge of ancient ideals of beauty comes largely from visual sources. So if we are to gauge just how much derriere was deemed desirable, we have to rely on sculptures, mosaics, and (where they survive) paintings. Artistic convention, as we'll see, was at least as important as representing reality; but such representations do at least suggest how the Romans liked to fantasize about themselves. 

I would guess that you're asking about women. But let's start with men (as the Romans surely would have), since this will allow us to comment a bit on method. As you mention in your question, statues of Greek men in the Classical period tend to be show every subject as a lithe, toned, and youthful athlete. The bodies of these sculptures may have genuinely corresponded to the gym-sculpted flesh of some Olympic champions. In most cases, however, we should see their nudity as a sort of costume, a way of communicating something about the man. The invariably undersized genitals proclaim the subject self-mastery. The smooth muscles of the upper body suggest dedication to a training regimen (and, more generally, to the citizen ideals of the gymnasium). And the bulging buttocks (visible in, for example, the famous [Riace Bronzes](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/241998179951985144/)) bespeak the surging strength of a sprinter and warrior. (Such buttocks were also deemed desirable in boys, as Mr. Good Argument in Aristophanes' *Clouds* uncomfortably reminds us). 

When Roman men began to commission nude statues of themselves, they inherited and imitated the Greek conventions for musculature, bulging rump and all. Most nude statues of Roman men belong to [the emperors](https://open.conted.ox.ac.uk/sites/open.conted.ox.ac.uk/files/styles/full_size/public/resources/Create%20Image%20collection/Claudius%20Herculaneum.JPG?itok=9uXmb-l4) (nudity was a mark of divinity, among other things); and to judge from that admittedly limited data set, we might infer that Roman men wanted to be seen as perfectly-muscled demigods. This, however, would be misleading. Most Roman men probably wouldn't have objected to being perfectly-muscled demigods. In reality, however, few were so committed to the gymnasium. Bulging muscles were for gladiators and laborers; the gentleman should be fit, not jacked to the gills. Artistic conventions, in short, were not necessarily standards of beauty. 

We need to keep this caveat in mind while assessing, at last, how Romans idealized the female body. To judge from artistic representations, the answer is straightforward: the Romans preferred broad hips and small, firm breasts. The Roman interest in peachy bottoms is on abundant display in the famous [mosaic of Cupid and Psyche](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/505529126908166068/) from Piazza Armerina, or in the even more famous [Venus Callipyge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Callipyge#/media/File:Venus_kallipygos03.jpg) (""fair-bottomed Venus"") in the Naples Archaeological Museum. So should we assume that these represent the Roman ideal of beauty? Only with caution. Like their male counterparts, female nudes in classical art are both stereotyped and freighted with meaning. The famous [Aphrodite of Cnidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite_of_Knidos#/media/File:Cnidus_Aphrodite_Altemps_Inv8619.jpg), the first and most famous female nude in Greek sculpture, played an important role in establishing the body standard of all subsequent female nudes. And just as the male nude was intended to advertise potency, so was the female nude (with its conventionally broad hips) designed to showcase fertility. 

We should not be excessively cautious here: the Roman ideal of female beauty probably corresponded fairly closely to artistic representations. To a certain point, of course, such representations actually created that ideal, life imitating art. It also helps that we have various and variously lurid literary descriptions of narrators lusting after broad-hipped women, including a very appreciative description of the Aphrodite of Cnidus.

Hopefully, this answers your question...if you would like to know more about nudity in ancient art, feel free to check out [my video on the topic](https://toldinstone.com/why-are-so-many-greek-and-roman-statues-naked/), filmed partly in the Art Institute of Chicago."
802,AskHistorians,"In the Netflix original film ""Outlaw King"" there is a brief scene that is clearly depicting a small group of black people in a village market in Scotland, dancing, playing instruments and wearing bright clothing. Do we have records of sub-Saharan Africans interacting with 14th century Scotland?","I'm not sure what you mean by ""interacted with."" Do you mean, are there any records of people from sub-Saharan Africa in 14th century Scotland? If so, I should certainly hope not--because *people in 14th century Scotland had no idea what ""sub-Saharan Africa"" was.* To have documentation of their presence would pitch us into a very special episode of *Outlander* indeed.

The Latin medieval understanding of world geography, for whose presence we have ample evidence for among the late medieval Scottish literati (t.i. the people writing documents), traditionally divided the world into Europe, Asia, and Africa. But just like our modern seven continents are cultural constructs, so were theirs--and they weren't the same. 

For example: John of Fordun's *Chronica Gentis Scotorum*, from the 1380s, assimilates Egypt into Asia. It outlines Africa as including Libya, Upper Ethiopia, and Lower Ethiopia. Reasonable, and reasonably kind of sub-Saharan...except that John's Ethiopia is not our Ethiopia (or, probably more to the point, medieval Ethiopia):

> For Ethiopia is threefold: its western portion being mountainous, beginning at Mount Atlas; its middle portion sandy; and its eastern, a desert.

Africa, then, is specifically (our) North Africa:

> By the Inland Sea, on the northern coast, is the country of Zeugnis, where Carthage once stood, and this is Africa proper.

I'm citing the *Chronica Gentis Scotorum* here because it takes us to the requested 14th century. But it's important to point out that even 15th century sources--when there were Ethiopian communities established in Rome, Ethiopian Orthodox delegates to the Council of Florence, Aragonese and Ethiopian royals negotiating marriage alliances--don't differentiate a North and sub-Saharan Africa, and have very European-culture-oriented understandings of ""Africa.""

For example, Andrew of Wyndoun's *Original Chronicle of Scotland*, from the 1420s, has a bit better geographic sense than John's. He recognizes the land around the southern Nile as part of Ethiopia, and beyond Ethiopia is just ""wilderness."" He situates ""Africa"" as:

* Ethiopia, where the Queen of Sheba is from
* Libya, the Pentapolis (a Roman province)
* Carthage, where Dido reigned
* Hippo, whence Augustine
* Mauritania, where...nope, Andrew got nothing here.

So we really should not expect to see records of ""sub-Saharan Africans"" in 14th century Scotland.

But I assume the interest in this thread has nothing to do with sub-Saharan Africa and everything to do with black people.

Well, I'm afraid you're out of luck there, too. Because medieval European ideas of ""race"", skin color, and geographic origin were...not ours.

By the 15th century, recall, Europe had more than ample contact with Ethiopia--in Jerusalem, in Cairo, in Rome. Well, here's a [15th century Queen of Sheba](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--2x1WUZQ1--/c_fit,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_320/njfe5glcf9sxv2koile4.png). Here's a [15th century Queen of Sheba](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/DE6T9K/king-solomon-receiving-the-queen-of-sheba-from-the-bible-historiale-DE6T9K.jpg). Here's a [15th century Queen of Sheba.](https://imgur.com/a/GaUpNdz) Here's one from [right around the turn of the 16th](https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/465954/946134/main-image). Heck, here's one [from the 18th century.](https://imgur.com/a/9L1l5Eg).

Medieval Europeans' ideas about skin color and geography were...very loosely linked. Why should that surprise us? A person of color in medieval Spain or medieval France was...a Castilian or a French person, right?

So what we see in art *and* in writing is a blend of skin color:geography-based heritage and skin color:morality. (And let's be clear, we are not dealing with nuances of color here). In romance literature, 'Saracen' characters sometimes have their skin change from black to ""white as milk"" when they convert from Islam to Christianity (*Cursor mundi*, 14th century). In the most famous German take on Arthuriana, *Parzival*, Feirefiz has a Muslim parent and a Christian parent, and...is *spotted*.  The *Estoria de Espana* blasts the conquering Saracens:

> Their faces were black as pitch, the most handsome among them was black as a kettle, their eyes shone like candles

and the *Song of Roland* says about Saracen character Abisme that he is ""black as pitch,"" with the archbishop wishing, ""This Saracen seems quite heretical; it would be much better if I were to kill him.""

You'll notice a pattern here: dark skin, in medieval writing, is associated *much* more closely with Islam than with Africa, much less Ethiopia. By the 14th century, Latin Europeans looked to Ethiopia to *save them from Muslims.* (I've discussed the issue of stark white/black skin color and morality [in this earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/42zw50/why_are_african_people_and_people_from_the/)).

Benjamin Braude has discussed how European scholars gradually linked skin color and geographic heritage over the course of the fifteenth century: via Spanish and Portuguese slavers in West Africa, via Latin European courts deciding that dark-skinned enslaved people made excellent *objects* to keep at court as a sign of their power and prestige. By the turn of the 16th century, these courts included one of particular interest to us. That is when we start to read about ""black Moors,"" ""black ladies,"" ""Blak Elene"" who also seems to be named ""Elen More,"" and so forth at the court of King James IV--of Scotland.

Which is exactly what we should expect, assuming no fluxes in the space-time continuum."
803,AskHistorians,"Back in Ancient Greece homosexuality was allowed. During the 17th century people had sex quite freely. Why is it that during the Victorian times, that suddenly changed and sex was deemed a very private affair? And why was homosexuality made illegal?","**Part I: Morality and the Victorian Family**

Someone else with expertise in that area will have to address the Ancient Greek side of things, but I can tackle the Victorians. Your question is based on a common misconception about the Victorian period, so I’m going to spend some time debunking that misconception and then try to explain why perfectly reasonable people believe it. 

The Victorian period did not represent a sudden rupture from the past with regards to sexuality. Same sex desire and homosexuality and sex outside of marriage were taboo to differing degrees in different times and places in Western culture for centuries. The Victorians did not just up and decide that sex was bad outside of nowhere. 

However, this is not to say that the Victorians didn’t differ from the generations immediately preceding them in some ways. One important development of the Victorian period was its heavy emphasis on domesticity. For the Victorians, the home and the family were paramount, the basis of the superior British civilization. The home was an oasis protected from the harsh outside world, a place of comfort where you can rest with your loved ones. Note that this ideal of the home and the family is not so different from how we as a culture think of homes and families today. However, for the Victorians, this idea of the home carried with it a hierarchy, with the husband and father as the head of house, the wife and mother as caretaker of the home (the ""Angel in the House,"" as one famous poem called it), both working to bring up well-adjusted, successful children.

Of course, people before the Victorians had homes and families and valued these things highly. The Victorians didn’t invent the family. What shifted was the importance of the family as a social category that needed to be protected and conceptions of public vs private life. On one hand, the nineteenth century saw, for respectable middle class people, the home was a private sphere, secluded from the world and with significantly more privacy within the home than had been available in previous centuries. Privacy has its own earlier history and development that other users can speak to better than me; for our purposes it’s enough to say that the domestic sphere was supposed to be private. 

I say this with the caveat that I’m describing middle class people here; the working classes often lived in very different conditions. This cult of domesticity was very much a phenomenon of the middle class, who set themselves up as the upright, respectable contrast to the stereotypical image of the profligate and licentious aristocrat that had been promoted in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century as the rake or the libertine. 

However, there is a contradiction in the Victorian family in that domesticity was also often the subject of public performance. We can argue that this phenomenon is reflected best at the top of society with Queen Victoria herself. Victoria navigated the contradiction of being a woman monarch. Women are supposed to be the Angel in the House, master of the private sphere, not involved in public life. To reconcile this, Victoria made a public performance of being the nation's exemplary mother—utterly devoted to her husband and many, many children. Victoria and Albert were a model of Victorian domestic life, but this model was also very publicly performed. "
804,AskHistorians,"""Cornfields now are where Troy once was"". How do abandoned cities physically disappear and have to be excavated?","Your question touches on a key archaeological concept called site formation, which is crucial to how we interpret sites, and much of what geoarchaeologists study. This [link](https://www.thoughtco.com/site-formation-processes-172794) provides a good brief overview of some of the theory behind site formation processes. 

Wind (aeolian) or flood events (fluvial) are two common instances of natural sediment deposition which slowly accumulates on top of abandoned sites. The climate and geography of a given site are extremely important in how these processes influence deposition; many cave or rockshelter sites, for example, have very little deposition, and archaeologists must be extremely careful since, in some cases like these, excavating only a few centimeters could be looking back thousands of years! 

On the other hand, using earth and rubble as fill to bury or level off unwanted portions of towns was also common. An 1862 site I studied in rural Minnesota was found nearly 1 meter (39 inches) below the surface; though historically a relatively recent site, over the past 160 or so years several landowners had used nearby sediment and debris to bury trash or level off the landscape.

As for the second part of your question, cities were typically abandoned slowly, often due to the threat of violence from nearby enemies or, more commonly, a lack of resources necessary to sustain it. Once a city fell or was abandoned, they were typically reused as extraction sites for building materials. Notable examples can be seen of Roman ruins reused in Medieval structures. Cities that are reduced to rubble through warfare or natural disasters are also more easily subjected to the site formation processes mentioned above."
805,AskHistorians,"In the United States we have to register to exercise our right to vote, but we dont have to register to exercise our right to buy guns or to exercise any other right. How and why did registering to vote begin? Did Americans in the 1700's have to register to vote?","Prior to the 15th Amendment, voting was almost entirely something with the purview of the individual states, and even afterwards, states still retained some leeway in the mechanics of voting, which includes registration^1 . As such, there is no singular answer here, as different states did things differently, but we can at least talk about a few trends, focusing on the South as it is the region I am most familiar with, and with the caveat that I would *not* firmly state this applies equally to northern states, where the process might have been quite different.

To start with, as you seem to suspect, voting didn't always require registration as we think of it today. In the early days of the Republic, voting was a very public, very community oriented act. White men would go to the polls where their eligibility would be decided by the election officials - often the elite and the 'up-and-comers' of the region - their identity affirmed by the community around them. The ballot they would then cast was public. A very basic form of registration did exist in most jurisdictions but it was often the most perfunctory of processes, simply a county official writing up a list of names, and most likely if you *weren't* on that list you would still be able to vote as long as you were recognized by the community. Some states did maintain certain property requirements for certain elections, in in such cases there would be need to demonstrate eligibility, but on the whole it remained a very simple process. In any case, these lists were not overly important to the election process, the most common use simply being to have a number of eligible voters to compare the election returns to at the end of the day to determine turnout (or in rare cases, fraud). 

The process could feel somewhat hostile, and in all fairness, it kind of was intended to be. This being the days before the Australian (Secret) Ballot, ones vote was known to the community, and was cast under the watchful eyes of ones betters. In the rural south, often the polling place itself would be the plantation home of a local planter. Christopher Olsen describes the electoral process, and the implicit pressures that voters faced, wonderfully in the following passage, which I believe also helps shed light on the idea of identity at the polls too:

>Naturally, the board [of police] chose Squire [William] Vick and fellow planters Christopher Field and Dr. Jon J. Ross as election-day inspectors. Neighbors since [Bolivar] county's early days, all three men lived along the river near Bolivar's Landing. This triumvirate sat in judgement on prospective voters, allowing or challenging their rights to democratic privileges. No matter how often the inspectors exercised their authority, the symbolic effect of the setting must have been impressive. As they walked through the gate and approached Vick's front veranda, some voters surely understood the realities of wealth and power displayed there. Casting ballots under the nose, even the watchful eyes, of the county's greatest patrons, young farmers and new residents like A.H. Brice, who had recently arrived from Louisiana with his wife and little else, quickly learned who matters in the neighborhood. [...] 

>Once authorized to vote, each man handed his ballot to William E. Starke Jr., the returning officer. Then only 22, Starke already owned thousands of dollars worth of cotton land and over 30 slaves. He was also Peter Starke's nephew. The elder Starke [was a state senator and close friend of Vick]. Moving down the line, each voter gave his name to one of the clerks seated nearby: Robert E. Starke, Peter's son, or Dr. Ross's son John Jr. The implications of such an arrangement could scarcely have escaped most voters, or those seated as inspectors and clerks. For a man unfamiliar with the local power structure, casting his ballot on Vick's porch with the next generation of leadership on hand to learn the routine effectively showed him his place.

This slice of life, from election day in 1855, shows several things, I hope. First, how eligibility was enforced within the community. They first had to face the three inspectors, the most powerful men in the area, who had the right to challenge their eligibility in the first place, and from there, they then had to openly cast their ballot in view of the young scions of the county. Variations of this system could be found in other southern states to one degree or other, and allowed the easy perpetuation of the local oligarchies that controlled much of the region. Although generally seen as less corrupt, similar systems were not unusual in the North either, where voting too was a hyper-local community ritual (I won't digress, but [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5e5cub/how_were_overseas_american_soldiers_ballots/da9ru5f/) I discuss absentee balloting during the Civil War, and the reluctance to allow any form of voting that was not done in person). Various, basic forms of registration may have existed, but the core part of voter identification was simply being there in person, and known by those around you.

But then that whole Civil War thing happened, and that kinda changed things. The herrenvolk democracy became threatened by the end of slavery and enfranchisement of the freedmen, who often could form powerful voting blocs in some areas where they well outnumbered their former enslavers, and resulting, for a brief time, African-American elected officials at every level of government in the South, right up to the US Senate. But of course, this was short lived and the end of Reconstruction signaled the death knell. It is in the post-Emancipation, post-Reconstruction period, and especially the rise of the Jim Crow regime, that we begin to see stricter requirements for voter registration. This was something that was, in fact, anticipated in the drafting of the 15th Amendment, but those who supported more expansive protections failed to win out. Whereas the Amendment as ratified read:

>The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.

Earlier proposed wording included:

>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall deny or abridge to any male citizen of the United States of the age of twenty-one years or over, and who is of sound mind, an equal vote at all elections in the State in which he shall have his actual residence, such right to vote to be under such regulations as shall be prescribed by law, except to such as have engaged, or may hereafter engage, in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, and to such as shall be duly convicted of infamous crime.

or alternatively:

>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge or deny to any male citizen of the United States of sound mind and twenty-one years of age or upward the equal exercise, subject to such registration laws as the State may establish, of the elective franchise at all elections in the State wherein he shall have actually resided for a period of one year next preceding such election, except such of said citizens as shall engage in rebellion or insurrection, or who may have been, or shall be, duly convicted of treason or other infamous crime.

Including stronger, more specific language, however, was supported by a small, radical group of Republicans, and without compromises within the party, attaining the necessary 2/3 support would have been impossible. In the end this forced the radicals to back the moderates preferred language, which aside from race, left requirements for suffrage to the states, including registration and criminal history. Tragically, these inclusions would not only have provided a framework for preventing the sorts of onerous registration or eligibility requirements that came after the end of Reconstruction, but also prevented disenfranchisement for most felons, another form of voter suppression that was used primarily against African-Americans convicted, rightly or wrongly, of petty crimes. Protecting race, but allowing nominally race-neutral prohibitions might have been closer to the victory moderates wished for *if* Reconstruction had succeeded, but in reality it was a hollow victory at best. The resulting final draft was an ""*ambiguous commitment to the black franchise*"", and its failures would soon be happily exploited to the joy of the white elites of the South, and the detriment to the black, and poor white, populations there for nearly a century. The result, you can probably already guess, but in any case was quite predictable. 

With the end of Reconstruction and the triumph of 'Redeemer' governments, just about any possible barrier to the voting by African-Americans was implemented. Most famous, perhaps, being literacy tests, but plenty of other mechanisms, including more expansive registration requirements that could be a bureaucratic quagmire for even a quite literate person to navigate, such as requiring documentation of voting history, and subjective tests that could be failed at the whim of the man conducting them. Even though they were clearly targeted primarily at the black population, being *as written* race neutral (the laws, after all, did impact many poor whites, a not-unwelcome byproduct for the white elites), the laws didn't violate the 15th Amendment as passed, although whether courts would have been forceful in upholding the Constitution with the draft language we can only speculate, given that even the ratified language was hardly well enforced (See Giles v. Harris or US v. Cruishank, among others), and registration requirements were waived or ignored in many cases for white persons, such as small-time felons, or with blanket ""Grandfather Laws"" which ensured that they needed to meet *none* of the requirements, essentially."
806,AskHistorians,"Nowadays, Hitler is widely regarded as the most evil human to ever live. But who was used as the standard of comparison for evil before Hitler?","[I've written on this before, which I'll repost here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/bq5795/was_hitler_compared_to_someone/eo1rjbj/). I would stress one thing though, namely that this answers a broader question that what was asked here. Some of the comparisons are about evil and most relevant here, but not all are figures of *evil*. This tracks not only what Hitler was compared to, but how those comparisons *changed* from his rise to power, to his rulership, his conquering, and eventually, of course, the fall of the Third Reich:

Prior to the arrival of Godwin's Law, and the inevitable conclusion of comparing all things to Hitler, during his own rise, Hitler was compared to many people, both real and imagined. Gavriel D. Rosenfeld kindly has done much of the legwork in providing what is the up to what is perhaps the most comprehensive study of this niche topic, and breaks down the comparisons into several broad groups, although they were not entirely exclusive:

* Ancient tyrants and conquerors
* So called “Barbarian” warlords
* Medieval and Early Modern religious fanatics
* Modern dictators 
* Mythical figures

The specific 'class', and specific figures within it, were often drawn on to illustrate specific themes, and the favor shown to certain ones over others often shifted through Hitler's rise and rule.

For instance, in his early days, prior to coming to power, it wasn't uncommon to compare Hitler to his future second-fiddle, as Benito Mussolini, installed in power in 1922, to many commentators figured are a fairly obvious point of comparison, least of all given Hitler's quite explicit attempt at emulation of the March on Rome with his own failed 'Beer Hall Putsch'. A few commentators of the time drew comparisons to the 19th century French populist Georges Boulanger, whose movement had almost lead to a coup in the late 1880s, and in the violence of Hitler's rhetoric, the ghost of another Frenchman, Maximilian Robespierre, was raised by some, a parallel with of The Terror with possible promises of the same befalling Germany.

As far as real people went though, one of the most popular, and enduring, of comparisons would be to Napoleon I (Napoleon III too, occasionally, especially in the early days of power where their paths seemed similar to some). This was especially popular with the British, and Churchill specifically but by no means exclusively. Framing the two as similar in their desires for domination and conquest, likewise Britain could be framed as the plucky little country that would be underestimated, and save Europe.

Other historical figures too were brought out. Attila the Hun and Genghis Khan for instance both figured as rough analogies for the images of fire and destruction that they brought to the popular imagination, and the same that Hitler was bringing to Europe, and Nero was used a few times in the wake of the Reichstag Fire, harkening back to the alleged fiddling while Rome burned. 

Especially in the latter part of Hitler's reign, more apocalyptic language became common, and no more so than Satan himself, which had been something of the 'go-to' incarnate of evil before Hitler took his place in the popular consciousness (although that certainly also just says something about secularization of society). The Lord of Lies was joined by any number of other forms such as the Antichrist, but more erudite writers brought in comparisons such as Loki in the context of *Ragnarok*, and also less known ones like Sciron, a figure I had to look up, and apparently the demigod who Theseus killed, and ""killed travelers by kicking them off a cliff"".

This is *far* from exhaustive, to be sure. The biggest name, probably, should be Napoleon, although of course the comparison has flipped and now some instead call him the “the 18th century Hitler.” It isn't an entirely fair comparison of course, which breaks down in many points and thus requires focus on only specific threads, but of course, some worried too about that, with some writers warning that it was important *not* to let Hitler's memory be rehabilitated in the same way that of the first 'Little Corporal' had been. Nevertheless though it is, again, a lasting one that remains even today, although even the book *Napoleon & Hitler: A Comparative Biography* is quick to note that whatever the 'inescapable resemblances', ""no one will dispute that Hitler was more evil than the Emperor, did evil on a far greater scale.""

All in all, the point to be made is that many different figures were used, some briefly, others enduringly, some fairly and others not. The whole point of an analogy of course is that it *isn't* perfect, but rather allows an easy to understand comparison to be drawn, and that is what so many of these in the end served. As Rosenfeld notes in his conclusion, Hitler is Hitler, and it is hard to find a previous figure that is all encompassing and holds the same meaning in every sense. None of the figures listed here work *perfectly* because, to quote, ""*There was no single figure denoting evil in the same uncontested way that the former Führer does today.*"" But the different figures, used in different ways, come together to demonstrate the ways in which people tried to grapple with his rise to power and his reign, and the analogies of the past - as well as the ethereal - that they drew on to compare it to.

I've only provided a small smattering of examples, and I would encourage anyone interested to check out Rosenfeld's paper as it is much more deep than my comparatively brief summation ([also check out his AMA!](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8r3e5x/i_am_gabriel_rosenfeld_professor_at_fairfield/)), but I *will* be editing in an appendix as I go through the paper again and try to list all of the names that he makes mention of...

Rosenfeld, Gavriel D. 2018. “Who Was ‘Hitler’ Before Hitler? Historical Analogies and the Struggle to Understand Nazism, 1930–1945.” *Central European History* 51 (02): 249–81.

Seward, Desmond. **Napoleon & Hitler: A Comparative Biography*. Thistle Publishing, 2013.

**Appendix**: Hitler was like... 

The following is a list that I think includes every name Rosenfeld makes mention of (might have missed a few), but given the mountain of responses asking ""what about...?"" I need to strongly reiterate, it is *not* exhaustive, and a list that was would likely be impossible. I went through this afternoon and edited in a brief description of the reason(s) for the comparison - was it a matter of their conquests, their persecutions, their pure embodiment of evil or brutality...? - but can expand on anything in particular if asked of course.

It is also important to reiterate what was noted in the conclusion, namely that this list reflects the plurality of evil, and the lack of a single, clear, ""Hitler before Hitler"". Many different comparisons were made, and many seem almost laughable in hindsight, but they nevertheless reflect attempts to understand Hitler's rise, his reign, and his fall, through the lens of the past, and analogies to figures also known for the ills that the did.

ETA: A key to the appendix."
807,AskHistorians,Are there any disagreements between English and U.S historians on any facts/aspects of the American Revolution?,"This is an interesting question and something that people have been wondering about for a long time.  Before I can answer it, I feel like it is worth disclaiming that I am not British, in terms of national origin. I am American, was educated from elementary school through my graduate program entirely in America, so when I speak here, I am talking about what academic historians say about the American Revolution on the university level stage. I have no knowledge what schools, books, or teachers say for students beneath college level.  Fortunately, since the American Revolution is something studied globally, I’ve studied historiographical debates of modern and previous historians in Britain, and I will be happy to discuss that here.

Overall, the majority of historians who studied and reported on the American Revolution currently have no major conflicts with American historians who study the same time period, but this is not true for all of the last two centuries.  The first person to tackle this question was British historian Richard Middleton, who conducted research and wrote about it in his article, [“British Historians and the American Revolution”](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2767062) . His article mainly seeks to study what early British historians said and reported on the American Revolution.  I feel obligated to point out that in these early days of the discipline of academic history scholarship, being objective was not something that was desired.  

Early historians, generally speaking had very little problem with letting their biases show.  This drastically changed during the middle of the 20th century, as historians sought to become more objective in their study and reporting of history.  It’s also worth noting that the vast majority of British scholarship in the first century and a half after the American Revolution took place was mainly focused on British perspectives; such as British politics and economics during that period.  Americans, especially during the 19th century conducted a lot of history related to the biographies of the ""Founding Fathers"" and also many sub-topics within the war itself (like military history of the Continental Army). Far fewer British historians studied American perspectives on the war, such as the Continental Congress, the Founding Fathers, or the Contiental Army. 

Middleton noted that many British historians were British apologists, who did side more favorably with the British Crown's decisions during the war and were very critical of the rebelling colonists.  This article does a few interesting things, first it accounts for a history of early British Historians who studied the American Revolution and notes that some of the early historians from the late 18th century were in fact more favorable in their views of the rebelling colonists, but they were the minority.  Historians tended to be torn between two radical positions in the U.K. One historian, Sir George Otto Trevelyan created a three-volumne account of the American Revolutionary War between 1874 and 1880.  Trevelyan, a liberal, reported that the first twenty years of King George III’s reign was a period of regression for English laws and and rights.  His writing reflects that the Americans were justified in overthrowing the British government, calling the Americans “law respecting people, who did not care to encroach on the privileges of others and liked still less to have their own rights invaded.’ [Middleton, 50].  This created one of the first historiographical debates in this particular field, with other men, like William Massey and William Lecky arguing for the traditional “Tory” view of the war.  Where Trevelyan came down hard on royal governors and British officials in America, historians like Lecky was much more gentle on them, saying that they were just loyal men trying to fulfil their duties to the King. [Middleton 51]. Ultimtely, Middleton noted a few key differences between these earlier types of scholarship between American and British scholarship on the war:

> From this study of British historians and the American Revolution, one or ore general conclusions can be drawn. In the first place, there has bee na curious dichotomy between scholars on both sides of the Atlantic as to what actually constituted the Revolution. Most British writers do not appear to consider it to be properly underway until the fateful year of 1775, while for most American writers, it was then merely a matter of dotting the ‘i’s’ and crossing the ‘t’s’ on the declaration of independence [sic].  There has also been little attempt to understand the revolt of the thirteen colonies by analysis of their social, economic, or politiocal development, lines of approach for so long popular with the American historians. [Middleton,  58]

Historians during the 20th century, especially in the post World War II era appeared to settle more soundly into the more objective approach to history.  Middleton spoke also of, at the time of the publication of that article in 1971, how there was a revival of the British study of the American Revolution during his present because of the infusion of American culture, history, and politics that exploded in those preceding decades. [Middleton, 56]
In recent history, the vast majority of historical scholarship that has come out (at least as what I’ve seen and studied] has not conflicted with the current consensus of scholarship  coming out of the United States.  Some British historians, like Stanley Weintraub’s *Iron Tears* has [pointed out some differences that he sees in views of the American Revolution](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4727956), but nothing really seems too far out that it would conflict with what other historians would say.  For instance, he shows that from the British perspective, the “taxation without representation” rallying cry of the colonists was a bit weak of an argument from the British perspective because many of the Englishmen living in England were not represented in Parliament either.  (His book though more-so focuses on how the Average person in Britain felt about the war, rather than focusing on Historians studying that period).

Overall, modern scholarship between historians of the United States and Britain tends to add to the historical conversation in general on this topic, rather than causing conflict between them.  Historians will disagree in every field, it's why consensus does not have the same power as a fact, but there isn't anything fundamentally different between scholarship coming out of the U.K. versus what is coming out of the United States or other countries.

809,AskHistorians,"I'm a well regarded prostitute in Pompeii in 20 CE with a solid clientele, and have just realised that I'm pregnant. What are my options?","In 1980, archaeologists working at Herculaneum (just down the coast from Pompeii) discovered a series of ""boat sheds,"" low vaulted structures arrayed along the ancient beach. During the eruption of Vesuvius, nearly 300 people, unwilling or unable to escape, had sheltered in the sheds, hoping for rescue from a passing boat. Death found them there in the middle of the night, when a wave of superheated gas rolled over the city. Pyroclastic flows soon covered the remains with up to 60 feet of volcanic debris. As archaeologists began to remove the rubble, they found the bones of the refugees in superb condition, and turned them over to a physical anthropologist for close study. The Herculaneans in the boat sheds, it appeared, had come from all walks of life. There was a wealthy man, with the gym-toned muscles and soft hands of a leisurely life. There was a Roman soldier, bones seamed with old injuries. And there were two women who, to judge from their badly scarred pelvic joints, had earned their living as prostitutes. One of these women, in her late forties, had clearly borne four or five children. 

Most prostitutes were slaves or freedwomen; those who were freeborn came from the ranks of the poor. Unless they happened to become the mistress of a prominent man (typically their owner), they had little hope of escaping a dangerous and degrading career. Like actors and gladiators, they were regarded as the dregs of society, and were banned from marrying any freeborn Roman. From the reign of Caligula onward, to add financial strain to social exclusion, they were subject to a special tax. 

Few working prostitutes had the resources to raise a family. Even if they were free, or were enslaved but allowed to keep a portion of their earnings, they only earned (to judge from the going rates at Pompeii) between 2 and 16 asses per customer (by way of comparison, a loaf of bread cost 2 asses). And few pimps, we can imagine, would have allowed prostitutes to keep children around the brothel. 

Pregnancy, in other words, was probably seen as a disaster. Prostitutes used more or less ineffective contraceptives. When these failed, as they invariably did, most carried their children to term, since abortions (herbal, very occasionally surgical) were highly dangerous. Occasionally - if we can believe Procopius' slanderous stories about the courtesan-turned-empress Theodora - babies were given to their fathers. Typically, however, the child's fate would depend on the mother's status. If she was a slave, her children were automatically her master's property, and had a reasonable chance of being raised in his household. If she was free, her pimp would probably force her to either give the child to a friend or expose it. 

Exposure was probably the fate of many children born to prostitutes. The child would be swaddled, carried to a public place (often a temple gate or a dungheap outside the gates), and left there. Mothers hoped that their children would be adopted by childless passers-by. Often, however, abandoned babies were picked up by slave traders. Many would be raised as prostitutes."
810,AskHistorians,"Anton Wilhelm Amo Afer was brought from modern-day Ghana to Germany in 1707, educated at a duke's court and became an eminent philosopher. How did contemporaries react to this first African professor in Europe? What is known about his own teachings?","His first disputation (in Latin) was “De Jure Maurorum in Europa” (The rights of blacks in Europe) so it is known that he didn’t lose his identity and thought about people from his native continent.
 
However, from 1730 onwards, he devoted himself to study of Natural Sciences rather than focus on Ethics or race relations. His inaugural dissertation was then on “De Humanae Mentis Apatheia” (The Absence of Sensation and the Faculty of Sense in the Human Mind and their Presence in our Organic and Living Body) was a mix of philosophy and medicine and had nothing to do with racial relationships. If you are interested, he was a supporter of modified materialism. 

He returned to Halle in 1735 and taught a range of subjects, but specializing in exploring the relationship between the mind and body. This is indicated by the title of compilation of his lectures: “Tractatus de Arte Sobrie et Accurate Philosophandi”  (Treatise on the Art of Philosophising Soberly and Accurately). It had nothing to do with race relations.  He was known for chairing sessions defending doctoral theses that had themes close to his own which made a distinction between mind and our organic bodies. He was chairman of session where Johannes Theodosius Meiner defended his own thesis. 

In 1740, he moved to University of Jena but was unhappy due to prejudice there. Eventually, in 1746, he left Germany for motherland. Once he left Germany, voices against him became more vocal since he was no longer able to defend himself. In west-Africa, the Dutch found his first disputation and saw him as a danger against their colonial rule. He was arrested, taken to a Dutch coastal fortress, and died there in 1784. We don’t know about his quality of life within the fortress but it is likely that he was not jailed, just put under house arrest. Nevertheless, he produced no more works (or if he did, they were destroyed/unpublished). So, we don't know what happened to him there.

812,AskHistorians,"In books and movies, when a knight stays at a tavern, he leaves the next day on a “fresh horse.” How did innkeepers keep track of which horses they owned, and how did they get them back?","The romanticized image of the lone rider galloping away on a desperate quest isn't wrong, just *mostly* wrong. A knight left an inn on a different horse than he arrived on, sure...but who ever said he left alone?

Late medieval and early modern travelers who rented horses typically didn't just rent a horse. They also hired the services of a ""guide"" who would make sure they ""didn't get lost"" on the way to their next stop. Whether or not the traveler actually needed a guide. Their primary job, as you've probably gathered, was to bring the horse back to their employer.

In a lot of cases, even, the guide wouldn't be on a horse of their own. Several scholars have noted that journey speed was about the same for mounted travelers and travelers on foot. One of the main reasons there is that the enhorsed person was very likely riding next to someone walking. 

By the late 1500s in England, at least, it was finally standard for the guide to also be on horseback.Some places, my impression is particularly in Italy, it was more usual to find, by which I mean pay, someone at your destination willing to take ride the horse to its original inn.

As to the prospects of horse theft, especially if the guide is on foot...hiring a horse was NOT. CHEAP. Yes, it would be more, shall we say, *financially expedient* to steal a horse than to buy one. But in general, you'd have far better and less conspicuous ways of stealing horses than to ride away with one that was pretty well known, especially if you were also somewhat well known. (Of course, lords could also often get away with almost anything they wanted, but that's beyond the scope of the present question.)

You can see, too, how postal systems gradually evolved out of this type of setup. The ruler (or in Europe, the pope was an early adopter) would pay particular inns or stablemasters to always have horses ready for official messengers, who would work out ways to balance horses with the ""postmasters"" at the next stages. (Probably something similar to the standard practice, although these situations are examples of when mounted travelers can go MUCH faster than people on foot). With frequent enough message traffic, it was cheaper for non-urgent/secret letters to be carried by...well, mail deliverers, who knew the route from their stable to the next stops very, very well.

813,AskHistorians,"After his term as president, John Quincy Adams ran for a seat in the House of Representatives and held it for 17 years. How unique was it for American presidents to run for ""lesser,"" public offices after being president?","There have been very few Presidents who served in public office after the Presidency. JQA is *by far* the most famous of them, due not only to the mere length of his tenure in the house, but also due to the tenacious reputation that he earned while serving, where he became of the leading voices of abolition within Congress, fighting against the Gag Rule, the annexation of Texas, and participating in the famous legal case concerning the slave ship *Amistad*. He was the only former President to go to the House after, but not to Congress, joined in that by Andrew Johnson, although roughly opposite in terms of honor, Johnson serving a mere few months in the office in 1875 before dying in July of that year, and leaving no legacy to speak of.

There were a few others who had notable post-presidential political careers in highest level of government though. The next most obvious would be William Howard Taft, who was appointed as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by the next Republican, President Harding, in 1921, 9 years after he had failed to win reelection. It is often said that this had always been his true ambition anyways, and it is generally agreed that not only did he *enjoy* his time on the bench a great deal more than in the White House, but also that he was much better at it too, establishing himself as an able and forceful leader of the Court through the 1920s, generally seen as consistently conservative in how he kept the court directed, as well as being a strong advocate for legal reform from Congress, resulting in the creation of the Conference of Senior Circuit Judges and the passage of the Judges' Bill.

The final former President to highlight would be John Tyler, who I'm going to focus on here because conversely he is the most obscure on this count! After the Presidency he returned home to Virginia, and he did attempt to keep his reputation burnished, but didn't seek major office. With the decline of the Whig party, he began to turn toward the Democrats. In 1860, with deteriorating national situation, he attended the 1860 Democratic Convention, and although he didn't campaign for it, ""entertained the delusion"" that he might perhaps be offered up their Presidential candidate, under the impression that he would provide a unity candidate for the entire south to coalesce around. The odds of this were, in fact, nil, and he in the end became a supporter of Breckenridge, the more hardline candidate, announcing his impression of the situation to be ""*live or die, survive or perish.*""

Nevertheless, he wished not to see the Union perish, even if he feared it might be impossible to avoid, and as the wave of secession began, he was a supporter of the Crittenden Compromise, which had hoped to over a means to ensure slavery had stronger protections to alleviate concerns over Lincoln's election, but of course in the end failed. He continued to try to position himself as a force for compromise, offering to head a conference of the six slave and free states closest to the border, but this too didn't prevent the march to war, even if serving in the Virginia delegation gave him further chance to feel like he was trying. He saw a few other honors in the period though, being picked by Virginia to head a delegation to Pres. Buchanan to discuss the crisis, as well as to later meet with Lincoln on the eve of his inauguration.

His return to public service continued further with his selection to attend the Virginia convention for secession, where he was considered one of the most honored members, and by that point had shifted to being pro-secession, and by the vote on the 17th, had become one of the vocal proponents, and afterwards gave a public speech comparing their coming struggle to that of their revolutionary forefathers

With secession a done deal, he finally returned to public office, standing for election to the Confederate Congress, and being chosen by Charles City County to represent them in the House. Congress wouldn't meet until February, 1862, so he spent the intervening months negotiating the official terms for Virginia's entry into the Confederacy, as well as the agreement to move the capital of the wannabe nation to Richmond, from Montgomery. He traveled to Richmond to begin his new position... and died a month before the Congress convened, passing away on January 18th, 1862. In the United States, his passing received perhaps the least notice of any former president, the traitor's death going without comment from Lincoln and the government, while in Virginia, a 150-carriage funeral procession and great mourning accompanied his passing.

814,AskHistorians,How would Sherlock Holmes' drug use be understood by the audience of the time?,"Great question! I'll refer you to *Emperors of Dreams: Drugs in the Nineteenth Century* by Mike Jay, and I'll mix in a few other sources as we talk about it. David Musto (the god of American narcotics historians) wrote a fascinating 1989 paper entitled ""Why did Sherlock Holmes Use Cocaine?"" that I recommend too.

Before we talk about Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, let's pull back a little bit and talk about late Victorian British society's attitude toward narcotics. Narcotics ─ particularly opium and morphine, but also cocaine and other substances ─ were a hot-button topic in Victorian Britain and the United States at the time.

As Jay points out, a lot of the discussion on opium portrays it almost as a plague with significant racial undertones, given that most British and American audiences were introduced to opium by Chinese immigrants or a Chinese experience. That's remarkably ironic given the role the British played in spreading opium in China. In Britain, the Anglo-Oriental Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade circulated a journal called *Friend of China* that ostensibly tried to point out all the harm opium had done to China.

In reality, it was a spectacularly racist publication that frequently claimed that the Chinese were piteous children unable to protect themselves against the opium menace, and only Western society could save them. Moreover, the journal warned, the opium menace might spread to Western society, with Biblical allusions to Hosea 8:7 (sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind).

You see an anti-opium mood spread rapidly into popular culture in the late 1860s and into the 1870s. Dickens' unfinished novel, *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*, for example, features an opium addict and scenes in an opium den. The notion of the opium den as a plague, as something to be feared because it might infect polite society, begins to come to pass at this time. Conan Doyle takes it up, as does Oscar Wilde in *Picture of Dorian Gray.*

Meredith Conti, in a paper published last year in the book *Victorian Medicine and Popular Culture*, wonderfully explains that chronic drug use combined with this infectious, xenophobic viewpoint, and hit popular culture with a splash.

>""Soon, however, a number of factors gradually reshaped public attitudes toward drug addiction: the return of wounded soldiers addicted to analgesics; physician over-prescription; the surge in opiate-laced patent medicines ... the invention of the hypodermic needle; and the first legislative restrictions on non-medical opiate use.""

In popular society, there had been a belief during the middle part of the century that addicts had nothing to blame but themselves. It was because of their weak will, or poor morals, or some personal factor that made them vulnerable to opium, alcohol and vice. As Darwin's theories became more popular, the idea came about that there must be a genetic cause ─ that addicts have a hereditary inclination toward addiction.  

Note that there is at this time a big difference between *addiction* and *use.* This distinction would persist until the early 20th century, by and large. You'll frequently run into references to the idea that high-performing individuals, fast thinkers, big-doers, need to use narcotics to moderate their overheating minds, otherwise they might suffer a breakdown. You see this in *The Sign of Four,* where Conan Doyle writes about Holmes needing to stave off boredom.

Elsewhere, there's often a feminine tone to this language, as the thoughts of the period were that the feminine spirit was fragile and needed to be kept in balance or otherwise preserved from too much emotion.

The idea of a ""naturally corrupt"" class of people prone to addiction starts to change in the late 1870s and early 1880s. In 1876, Edward Levinstein published the influential *Morbid Craving for Morphia*, which described narcotics' *corrupting* influence, about how even proper people could be brought low. In the years after his work, drug addiction became a medical condition in Britain.

At the same time, cocaine begins to come onto the British scene in a big way. In 1885, for example, Doyle's hometown of Southsea hosts the British Dental Association's annual conference. The conference's big topic? The virtues of cocaine anaesthesia. This was also the time when Americans, British citizens and others in Western society were flocking to coca-laced beverages (*Coca-Cola,* anyone?) as the new fad. 

In a 1994 paper, ""Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle and cocaine,"" D.N. Pearce suggests that Doyle's studies at the University of Edinburgh, where toxicology research was quite advanced for the time, gave him a leg up in anticipating the harmful effects of cocaine.

By the time *The Sign of the Four* is published five years later, with its remarkable references to cocaine addiction, the popular mood had begun to shift in the direction of cocaine as a vice rather than a pure medicine. The Sherlock Holmes stories aren't the only place you see this discussion come up. Think of *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, published in 1886, and other stories, such as those by Bloomsbury and M.P. Shiel.

Jay suggests that Conan Doyle intended Holmes' cocaine habit to be part of his bohemian, counterculture identity, but as popular opinion began viewing cocaine as purely a vice, references fade to holmes' use. By 1904, when *The Missing Three-Quarter* is published, Conan Doyle writes that his hero has been ""weaned"" from his ""drug mania"" which had ""threatened to check his remarkable career,"" something that's clearly a ret-con to accommodate changing times.

As Musto wrote in his 1989 paper, ""Therefore, Holmes's use of cocaine was not reprehensible. Leading physicians much more prominent than the wise Dr. Watson recommended cocaine for the reasons Holmes used it. That he used cocaine was unfortunate, but he corrected the error ─ and that was commendable."""
815,AskHistorians,Sub question - Why can't we have 'Answered' flairs!?,"The core of the problem is that Reddit is simply not an ideal platform for a high quality sub like r/AskHistorians. While it's true that finding an exciting question with nothing but deleted comments can be annoying, the fault in no way lies with the sub. For long-time lurkers like me, what I find frustrating is not the deletions, but rather how ***every single thread*** has comments written by Redditors who can't be bothered reading the rules before they post. What would **REALLY** solve this problem is self-regulation on the part of countless posters who insist on posting jokes, one sentence answers and links to wikipedia, followed then by the inevitable barrage of requests that the mods solve the cat-herding problem of typical Reddit behavior.

816,AskHistorians,"Many people who suffer from paranoid schizophrenia have this fear of an overarching government conspiracy to spy on them and hide cameras and such. How would a medieval peasant with this condition be affected since they didn't have much of the technology at the time that we have now, to worry about?","[1/2] (or [1/3, thanks to the majestic /u/hillsonghoods])

It's true that no one would ever use the term ""medieval surveillance state."" However, the problem with that phrase is *state*, not surveillance.

You might be familiar, in media discussions, of the idea that we live (or in these accounts, lived) in a narrow band of history where there could be an expectation of privacy in the Western world. The typical image invoked is the village small enough that everyone knows everyone else's business. But that's still a fairly recent view.

Rewinding to the Middle Ages, we meet a concept called *fama*. This is a Latin word that means reputation or word on the street or rumor, some combination of those--and in medieval courts, *fama* was a legal principle with concrete implications.

Bad *fama* was used to discredit witnesses or reject their testimony altogether. According to 13th century French legal texts, in a lawsuit between someone with *bonne renomee* and someone with *mals renome*, the first person would receive the benefit of the doubt automatically. In some cases, bad *fama* would cause a person's lawsuit to be dismissed out of hand, or permit them to push for charges of fraud. 

F. R. P. Akehurst citing civil jurist Philippe de Beaumanoir gives this exemplum of the power of *fama*--and who had control over it:

> An innkeeper with a good reputation could avoid charges of having stolen property from his guests, but if his reputation were not very good he would be the most likely suspect, even if there were signs of forced entry and broken chests. In such a case, the reputation of the innkeeper would be determined by a judicial inquiry. 

> The only kind of evidence such an inquiry would turn up would be oral: what people *said* about a person could make or break him. The inquiry also delved into what other people thought of a person, what they remembered of him.

While Beaumanoir is writing a prescriptive text, Akehurst compares the procedures listed favorably in terms of reflecting contemporary practice. So we should take seriously what Beaumanoir is saying here: forensic or physical evidence did not determine the case; other people's opinions of a person close to the crime did. Gossip made reality.

There is also, for the late Middle Ages into the early modern era, the question of the sacrament of confession. This has a vast and contentious historiography, so in advance, I want to be clear that we have to distinguish between ""the population at large"" and ""some individuals here and there""--that is, not everyone has the same experience or depth of exposure/intensity/care.

In 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council very famously (well, okay, very famously to medievalists, which is not really very famously at all) decreed that all Christians of both sexes must confess their sins to their parish priest once a year. The actual point wasn't confession itself, of course--it was that lay Christians must receive the Eucharist once a year, and confession was necessary to cleanse one's soul before what was central enough to be just called ""the sacrament.""

In practice, however, the confession-Eucharist connection amounted to a strong focus on *both* sacraments in religious instruction: the Eucharist, that it was the genuine body and blood of Christ and reception was necessary for salvation; confession, what sins were and what was moral behavior and the necessary contrition-confession-penance triad. Oh, yeah, and that really you needed to confess to a priest and receive sacramental absolution; just shouting at the sky was insufficient for salvation purposes.

Now, this doesn't mean that in 1216, every Christian in the medieval West was confessing their sins on Palm Sunday *just like that*. However, participation ramped up over time; by the fifteenth century there were dioceses mandating confession more than once a year, and others reporting it was offered more frequently to certain groups (""women and students"" being my favorite example). 

Medievalists have absolutely called confession an attempted tool for social control or discipline. It's not an accident that even into the 15th century, German-language (not Latin!) texts on awareness and avoidance of sin divide wrath into murder, war, and arson--these are real issues people struggle with. 

And as Pierre Payer pointed out, instructional manuals for *confessors* focus on sexual sins at a rate from twice as often as anger and greed (Robert Grossteste) to seventy-six times as often (Robert of Sorbon, *we know who you are in the dark*). The Church had long made the definition of marriage and attempt to control sex a centerpiece of its play for power over the Church on Earth to make sure it became the Church in heaven as well.

So looking at late medieval guides to confession, for priests and for lay people alike, scholars like Steven Ozment and Jean Delumeau argue for the late Middle Ages as a period of immense social anxiety over confession, over having to scrutinize every inch of your soul for every possible sin lest you miss a tiny thing that punts you to purgatory or even hell. The problem is, to this end they cite almost exclusively post-Reformation Protestants, *especially* Martin Luther. A significant chunk of whose theological game was that terror over confession and penance and never being good enough was part of the spiritual crisis and temptation of the devil that pushed him towards the 'breakthrough'. These are, in other words, absolutely not objective accounts.

Looking at medieval sources, we find a much more diverse picture. Standards for behavior/recognition of one's sins to the point of emotional self-mutilation became a hagiographical trope for women ""living saints"" like Dorothea von Montau and Elisabeth Achler. They're confessing every day, confessing every sin of their childhood over and over, etc etc. 

And usually their hagiographer (also their confessor) is noting that these women should be examples of spiritual excellence, NOT role models to follow. There is also evidence from 15th and 16th century sermons that some theologian-priests were preaching that the *desire* to be saved, along with the sacraments, was enough even if one couldn't live up to behavioral standards. 

Unfortunately, we can't do what we really want, which is to get down in a confession session between a priest and penitent and find out what confessors *actually* demanded. Did they scroll down the list of Latin questions about sins and translate to the vernacular on the fly? (These include things like ""did you kill anyone"" to ""did you throw snowballs at someone passing by your house"") Were they ""one and done""-ing assembly line offering services? Of course, there was probably a variety of severity...and by the 15th century, lay people were gradually winning the right to choose their own confessors.

Which brings us, in fact, back to *fama*.

Confession today brings up mental images of ""the confessional,"" the closed little *private* box, hushed voices. The confessional is an early modern invention. While priests were required to keep the so-called seal of the confessional, the actual practice of it would be the penitent standing next to the priest with a long line of their neighbors standing right there--easily in a position to overhear, popular literature attests.

I've illustrated, I think, the immense difficulty of securing emotional (not necessarily physical) privacy in the later Middle Ages, far beyond 'nosy neighbor' nostalgia for early 20th century Main Street, USA or 19th century prairie towns. I've also shown that people reacted with different intensity to aspects of this culture. That's not to say anything about 'mental illness' at all, you understand; I just want to start by breaking down a monolithic medieval Christian society in terms of responses to what we might see as ""popular surveillance.""

I am in general going to let the psychologists talk about schizophrenia and its history as a disorder, but I want to make a few remarks on how historians approach neuropsychiatric disorders. A lot of things about the Middle Ages scream ""superstition!"" to us today--fear of the devil, belief in mystical visions can easily read as delusions and paranoia. We need to distinguish what was quite normal to most medieval people from what can read as sliding into paranoia today."

818,AskHistorians,Why did the Nigerian Civil War (the Biafran War) have such a bizzare amount and combination of countries as belligerents for each side?,"Interesting questions. Let us break the answer into different countries, so that we may understand their motives for backing different sides, be them economic, ideologic or of allegiances in nature.

&#x200B;

**France and the United Kingdom:** 

&#x200B;

They were on opposite sides for several reasons, perhaps the main of them being oil interests, therefore their motives are fundamentally *economic.* According to Prof. Chibuike Uche in ""*Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War"",* a corporate conglomerate comprised of Shell and British Petroleum were in control of more than 80% of Nigeria's oil production, therefore making a priority for the British government to ensure their supply of oil wasn't jeopardized by the hostilities. They didn't however actively support the Nigerian Federal Military Government (FMG) until the latter imposed a blocade to oil exports, forcing both Shell-BP and the British government to pick a side. Per a recommendation of the High Commissioner to Nigeria sir David Hunt to the British Foreign Secretary Baron George-Brown, they decided to back the FMG (albeit covertly in the case of the British government, which didn't publicly disclaim the actual amount of weaponry they supplied to the Nigerian FMG).

&#x200B;

On the other side, the French decided to back Biafra for different reasons. One of them concerns, as in the British case, oil. In *French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War*, Christopher Griffin explains that according to a CIA report, France had backed Biafra because of a prior agreement, by which Biafra ceded the percentage of the Nigerian oil production that a French company claimed to own. On a political and ideological level, France's support of Biafra stemmed from the decolonization process France had to go through after internal and international pressure during the second presidency of Charles de Gaulle. Even though French colonies gained official independence, unoficially they were still under de facto control of the French Government, due mostly to economic factors. Looking to extend their sphere of influence in Africa, France urged some of its former colonies such as Gabon and Côte d'Ivoire to support the Biafran cause.

&#x200B;

**USSR and US:**

&#x200B;

Let me first say that saying that these two countries were ""on the same side"" isn't necessarily accurate. Simply because they didn't oppose each other, doesn't mean, from a geopolitological analysis, that they agreed with each other.

&#x200B;

The US remained neutral in the conflict, essentially due to their alliance with the United Kingdom from a political viewpoint, and, once again, due to the importance of private oil interests in the region, held by Gulf Oil, which was one of the biggest oil producing companies in the planet.

&#x200B;

The USSR on the other hand, didn't remain neutral. Quite on the contrary, they supported the Federal Military Government. This was and continues to be viewed as a peculiar decision, because it didn't coincide with the ideology of marxism-leninism. Had it followed said ideas, the USSR should've perhaps supported the Biafran cause. However, international relations and foreign policy expert, with an emphasis in Russian foreign policy, Angela Stent, has an explanation as to why the USSR decided to go against its ideology and focus on pragmatism instead. In her 1973 essay *The Soviet Union and the Nigerian Civil War: A Triumph of Realism,* Stent argues that the Central Committee of the Communist Party decided to side with the FMG because of a realist principle.

On the one hand, ""Nigeria was probably one of the most consistently anti-Soviet and pro-West countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in the 1960s"". This made establishing diplomatic relations an arduous task. When the war broke, the USSR saw an opportunity to further improve their incipient relations with Nigeria. On the other, the pragmatic way forward was to intercede in favor of the FMG, because the USSR also opposed any form of secessionism.

&#x200B;

**Israel**:

&#x200B;

Zach Levey, of the School of Political Sciences of the University of Haifa, describes why the Israeli government acted as a double agent of sorts in *Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war, 1967–70*. 

&#x200B;

Israel stood by the FMG by selling them weapons, because they sought to avoid a rupture in relations with Nigeria, which Israel understood ""would have affected Israel's position in all of black Africa"". However, the Knesset, the Israeli legislature, was pressured by the Israeli people, because ""the plight of the Igbos reminded many Israelis of the Holocaust"". As a result, Israel decided to, clandestinely, send aid to Biafra in the form of arms as well as humanitarian assistance and money.

&#x200B;

**The Vatican**:

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, I didn't have previous knowledge regarding the Vatican's involvement, aside from the fact that they were indeed involved. I found that there isn't much information available at first glance on the Vatican's part in the war. However, upon further research I found two interesting things. Firstly, the website for the Embassy of Nigeria to the Holy See. In a section narrating the history of their bilateral relations, it, rather briefly, describes the Vatican's involvement through CARITAS Internationalis, which provided humanitarian relief to Biafra. The website goes on to say that the period of the war ""was not the period for diplomatic jaw-jaw"" between Nigeria and the Holy See.

&#x200B;

Secondly, on a more historical note, I found an article from The New York Times, from January 14, 1970. It describes the FMG's denunciation of the Vatican for the previously mentioned aid to Biafra, as well as for a comment by Pope Paul VI, who spoke of ""the possibility of genocide of the Ibo people"". It also states that Major General Yakubu Gowon, Nigeria's military leader and head of state, said in a radio interview, in reference to the Holy See's involvement of the war:  ""The federal military Government recalls the role of the Vatican throughout the Nigerian crisis, sustaining the rebels with money and Vital supplies and transportation links with the outside world. (...) The role of the Vatican has had the tragic consequence of prolonging rebel resistance, leading to the deaths of many innocent people and distress for the population in those areas."""
819,AskHistorians,"When two people touched and experienced a jolt of static electricity between each other, what did ancient peoples think was going on? Has there been any mention of this phenomenon prior to the discovery and understanding of static electricity?","[A repost of my previous answer that's the one in the FAQ linked by someone else](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7rvynq/what_did_people_think_about_static_electricity/):

I'm going to assume that by 'prior to the discovery and understanding of static electricity' you essentially are asking about the pre-'Scientific Revolution' time period - e.g., before William Gilbert's 1600 book *De Magnete* was using the word 'electricus' to refer to electrical phenomena, before Benjamin Franklin flying his kite and all that (after all, there's a sense in which electricity was first discovered by the first person to get a static electricity shock), and certainly before electric lights or Tesla cars.

It’s worth remembering that, in antiquity and the middle ages, the workings of the natural world were fundamentally mysterious. At a fundamental level, we modern types - living in a world with computers and search engines and university science faculties - generally assume that the natural world is orderly, based on natural laws. Because of this, the world is, for us, in principle usually going to be solvable. Things we don't understand are probably understandable through further research or experimentation (or perhaps have already been solved by people much smarter than us). Ancient and medieval people simply didn't have this mindset. As a result, their explanations of the natural world were - understandably - *magical* ([see this previous comment of mine for more background on the mysterious, magical world of the ancients](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6pf6vw/preenlightenment_science_has_a_popular_reputation/dkpx2oy/)). After all, if you think that the world at a metaphysical level is fundamentally unknowable, the presence of spirits and souls in objects doesn’t seem entirely silly. Even Aristotle, that most practical-minded and scientific of Ancient Greek philosophers, thought that inanimate substances contain meaning/purpose (*telos*), and talked about souls, in ways that seem odd to people who grew up in a world that assumes the universe is fundamentally physical.

Writers in antiquity and the middle ages often thought in terms of sympathies and antipathies; particular objects would have *natural* attractions and repulsions from others. So, for example, it was believed that rubbing garlic on a magnet would stop it from working, while rubbing lambs’ blood would make it work again. These beliefs about magnets were eventually shown to be incorrect, but even Scientific Revolution figures like Descartes believed some of them. In general, medieval writers weren’t particularly inclined to argue with ancient authors except where religious doctrine intervened, so it took until after Columbus had ’discovered’ America for these ideas about garlic and lambs blood affecting magnets to eventually stop being considered common knowledge. All of which is to say that ancient people thought very differently to us; they were not basically modern people who just hadn't figured out electricity yet.

With that in mind, let's look at what some ancient writers said about electricity. The first figure to discuss static shocks is usually considered to be Thales of Miletus, though we only know *that* he discussed static shocks because his writing has not survived. Our main source on Thales discussing electrical phenomena is a biography by Diogenes Laertius, written close to a millennium later. According to Laertius, Thales was ""the first, some say, to discuss physical problems. Aristotle and Hippias affirm that, arguing from the magnet and from amber, he attributed a soul or life even to inanimate objects.""

The wording here perhaps suggests that amber's electric effect after being rubbed (e.g., your hair might be pulled towards it) was well-known to the Greeks before Thales; certainly there's plenty of amber jewelry in the archaeological record. Laertius seems to me to be implying that Thales was the first to *theorise* about it, arguing that there was a sort of animateness in seemingly inanimate objects. But that quote is the sum and total of everything he said about it. It should be pointed out that the surviving writings of Aristotle - writing centuries after Thales and centuries before Laertius - only mention Thales arguing from the magnet rather than from both amber and the magnet. And because the text by Hippias that Laertius mentions is also lost, we can't tell whether that discussed Thales theories about electricity in more detail. Nonetheless, Thales probably argued that there is something *animate* in what are on the surface inanimate objects such as amber; otherwise the effect of static electricity would not occur.

In contrast to Laertius' brief mentions of Thales, the Roman writer Pliny The Elder in *The Natural History* - a sort of encyclopaedia of received wisdom on a variety of topics - discusses amber at length. Pliny points out within his discussion that ""[when a vivifying heat has been imparted to it by rubbing it between the fingers, amber will attract chaff, dried leaves, and thin bark, just in the same way that the magnet attracts iron](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D37%3Achapter%3D12)"".

Here Pliny makes a link between the electrical effect of amber and the magnetic effect of certain metals/stones ([I discuss pre-modern science conceptions of magnetism here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6kj0yv/the_compass_was_invented_far_before_the_discovery/djn2yf4/)); Thales probably made the same link, if Laertius's sources are accurate. Elsewhere in his writing, [Pliny The Elder also discusses electrical discharge in relation to fish](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=9:chapter=67): 

>The [torpedo](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/161397/0) is very well aware of the extent of its own powers, and that, too, although it experiences no benumbing effects from them itself. Lying concealed in the mud, it awaits the approach of the fish, and, at the moment that they are swimming above in supposed security, communicates the shock, and instantly darts upon them.

Pliny The Elder makes no attempt to explain the powers of the common torpedo here; he merely describes them as a prelude to pointing out how good torpedo liver tastes.

A few other ancient writers also discuss the torpedo. Plutarch says in *De Sollertia Animalium* that:

>	You know, of course, the property of the torpedo: not only does it paralyse all those who touch it, but even through the net it creates a heavy numbness in the hands of trawlers. And some who have experimented further with it report that, if it is washed ashore alive and you pour water upon it from above, you may perceive a numbness mounting to the hand and dulling your sense of touch by way of the water which, so it seems, suffers a change and is first infected. Having, therefore, an innate sense of this power, it never makes a frontal attack or endangers itself; rather, it swims in a circle around its prey and discharges its effluvia as if they were darts, and thus poisons first the water then through the water the creature which can neither defend itself nor escape, being held fast as if by chains and solidified.

There is also a lost text by Diphilus discussed briefly in Athenaeus’s *Deipnosophisticae*:

>	In his commentary on Nicander’s *Theriaca*, Diphilus of Laodicea says that not the entire body of the animal produces the numbness but only a part of it. He alleges that he has arrived at this conclusion on the basis of many experiments.

(Plutarch’s reference to ‘some who have experimented further with it’ may also be a reference to Diphilus)

Generally, as can be seen above, ancient writers don't really try to *explain* occurrences that we’d now understand as electricity. Our surviving references to electrical phenomena mostly just report them and marvel at them (I’ve quoted the ancient writers’ entire statements on electricity above - that’s as much detail as they went into). But perhaps we can get a window into how they implicitly thought electrical phenomena worked by looking at how they used their knowledge of amber and torpedos. And, well, what Pliny says about how to use torpedos does quite clearly suggest that he believed that their electrical abilities were essentially magical - there wasn't any obvious mechanism by which the torpedo could stun other fish, so it was probably magic. 

Specifically, the *Natural History* mentions various remedies that use the magical powers of torpedo. One hair removal remedy that Pliny discusses is ‘the brain of the torpedo applied with alum on the sixteenth day of the moon’. Additionally, if a torpedo is caught while the moon is in Libra and kept alive in the birthing room of a pregnant woman, Pliny believes that it makes childbirth easier. Note the way that both remedies involve the movements of the heavens in ways that sound like astrology to us. But remember that, from their point of view, if rays like the torpedo can affect other creatures at a distance in the water, why shouldn’t the movement of the moon also affect creatures at a distance? 

Finally, Pliny claims that excessive sexual craving can be dulled if the ‘gall of the torpedo, while it is still alive, [is] applied to the genitals’. Well, that one doesn't rely on the movement of the heavens, and...well, I can see how applying electricity to the genitals may cause some people to rapidly lose interest in sex. Some people, anyway.

Assuming I know where he is can I just walk up to the president in public and start talking to him, or even then would there be some kind of barrier between him and the general population?","The Secret Service did not start protecting the president full-time until after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901. The president would travel in public before this time with only a few aides or associates as a limited buffer against the public; in 1876, President Rutherford B. Hayes traveled to the exhibition in Philadelphia as a civilian alone. Five years later, President James Garfield was shot by Charles Guiteau at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington. Garfield was traveling by train to give a speech at Williams College and he was surrounded by the Secretary of State and Secretary of War and a few Washington city police officers.

821,AskHistorians,"In the movie BlacKkKlansman, David Duke uses phrase 'America first' and speaks about returning America to its greatness. Were these phrases really common for KKK back then or did the writers took 'artistic liberty' in this case?","In short, yes. ""America First"" was a common slogan for the KKK and for white supremacists dating back *at least* to the 1920s.

[Here's an image of women in the Klan marching in the 20s during their resurgence bearing a sign with the 'America First' slogan](https://imgur.com/a/7rywRPF)  

[And here's a commemorative coin dated to the ""Third Movement"" (1954-1969) bearing the slogans - The Invisible Empire, America First, and Preserve Racial Purity.](https://imgur.com/a/u95zMdD).

The coin is discussed by D.E. Birdsell in his 1977 book, Ku Klux Klan Tokens and he mentions that he was unable to find them being officially made by the Klan as an organization, but it was undoubtedly made by an individual adherent to the group. The phrase ""America First"" is very deeply ingrained into the KKK's ideology, as are many other phrases meant to be generally agreeable to the population that have dark undertones.    

A 1921 congressional hearing about the Klan's activities also has them directly stating ""[The Klan] stands for America first — first in thought, first in affections, and first in the galaxy of nations. The Stars and Stripes forever above all other and every kind of government in the whole world.""  

The idea of returning America to a mythical past is also integral to the Klan starting in the second movement.  Many far-right movements have it as their designated goal, Hitler writes about the end result of Nazism being a return of the superior germanic people to their agrarian and peaceful past without the corruption of inferior and insidious others.  The Klan, starting in the '20s were highly focused on spreading this growing idea of the antebellum South as a paradise that has since been corrupted by the aftermath of the Civil War and the black population entering spaces they hadn't been before. *The Birth of a Nation* was a film highlighting the loss of the peaceful South to a violent and savage black population, only for the people to be saved by the heroic KKK, this was right at the beginning of the Second Movement and set the tone for their messaging.  Overall, their message was successful and the idea of the idyllic antebellum South was very prominent in American culture for a very long time.  I don't know of any specific examples of the Klan pushing the exact message of ""Make America Great Again"", but they've certainly pushed messaging that might be worded differently but is essentially the same in spirit.

822,AskHistorians,"The Roman pantheon was presented to me in school as the same as the Greek, just with different names; was it that simple, or were there cultural distinctions being glossed over in the interest of brevity/simplicity? If there were differences, what were they?","In brief - for educational terms, it's a good-enough simplification for school purposes. But yes,  there were important cultural distinctions between the two.

I'm away from my books at the moment, so I'll do this one 'off the cuff' and lay down some suggestions for further reading: if you want to ask follow-up questions, I'll be able to get to those in a couple of days with the bibliography in front of me.

One thing that's often glossed over in school courses - and I say that as someone who teaches them - is that 'Greek Religion' and 'Roman Religion' (or even, perish the thought, 'Greco-Roman Religion' are not simple, single, fixed ideas. Both varied considerably over time, where you were, and who you were. I'm going to talk a bit about Greek religion first to lay some groundwork, and then try to describe what happens when it collides with Roman religion.

At this stage, we need to introduce the idea that the 'same' god could look quite different in different contexts. It was normal (particularly in the Greek world) to address a god not only by their name, but also by an 'epithet' - a short descriptor that gave a bit of detail about the god, but also reflected the particular aspect or characteristics of them that you were calling on. Apollo (we'll get to him properly later) is a great example - at Delphi, you would probably address him as *Apollo Pythios* ('Apollo of the Pythia - his oracular priestess at Delphi) and primarily conceptualise him as a god of prophecy who might advise and help you. On the other hand, if your city was struck by a plague, you might sacrifice to him as *Apollo Ekbolos* ('Apollo who Strikes from Afar') and conceptualise him as a terrifyingly inscrutable force for vengeance.  On one level, they're the same god, but they also feel rather different.

You might also have learned in school that the 'big gods' - the Olympians and so on - are only the tip of the religious iceberg: both Greek and Roman religion are full of 'small gods' of rivers and mountains, semi-divine heroes and other extremely local figures that mean that religious observation can change considerably from region to region, or even village to village. Even when talking about the greater gods, different people worship them to different degrees - most obviously, the people of Athens treated Athena as one of the most important of the gods, while she would be a relatively minor religious force in most other Greek cities.

This means that the 'international', 'official' Greek pantheon (which was never an idea that anyone in the Greek world, ever, would have accepted) was only ever a kind of *lingua franca* \- people around the Greek world could understand it and use it as a common point of reference, but it didn't really reflect anyone's actual, day-to-day experience of religion. Straight away, we're dealing with a religious landscape that is incredibly fragmented, and where any attempt to generalise about it smooths down the reality.

**EDIT:** [So is the Roman pantheon - on which more detail here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/htyia8/the_roman_pantheon_was_presented_to_me_in_school/fyn574j/)

Roman religion and Greek religion have a common source - they both descend from Indo-European belief and folklore, which included key concepts like the association between the gods and the sky, the ultimate descent of the gods from the union of the sky-god and the earth-goddess, and a set of 'divine twins' who were the sons of the sky-god and act as heroes and rescuers. However, Italic (and so Roman) religion developed distinctive aspects with no parallels in the Greek world. These include the belief in the *lares* and *penates*, small, unnamed gods of hearth and home which protected both people's homes and the state as a whole. They also included the practice of augury (reading the future from the flight of birds), and various beliefs about the spirits of the dead, such as the benign *manes* and the restless, malignant *lemures*. Though they've been somewhat neglected in the scholarship until recently, these played a huge part in the day-to-day religious life of the Roman world.

The Romans engaged in a practice called *interpretatio Romana*, where they 'interpreted' others' gods as reflections or misunderstandings of their own, and so worshipped them either as alternate names or as epithets of their own gods. Hence we see dedications made at ancient Celtic shrines of Sulis to 'Sulis Minerva', as the Romans 'interpreted' Sulis as their goddess Minerva. It's an interesting question to think about what was going through the heads of people worshipping at that site - are they just worshipping their old gods, and paying lip service to the Roman names? Or is there something fundamentally significant about doing even that in a Roman temple, in Latin, surrounded by Roman statues? *Interpretatio* is certainly an act of imperialism - by 'claiming' gods and situating them within the Roman pantheon, it turns their worship into an act of integration into Roman culture, and reduces any opportunity to use those gods as a locus of non-Roman identity, or as a focus of resistance to Rome.

It's really in the Late Republic and the Augustan period that we see a huge boom of Roman texts talking about the gods, and most of these have a vested ideological and/or literary interest in playing up the similarities between the two. In most cases, they come from writers trying to establish a place for Rome within the literary and cultural world created by the Greek classics, particularly the works of Homer, and to situate Rome's foundation and identity within the heritage of Greek mythology. Virgil's *Aeneid* is the great example - [I've written another post here about how that poem engaged with a complicated oral tradition](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hlzwdv/did_the_aeneid_exist_in_some_form_prior_to/fx38ayh/), and how Virgil invariably made choices that emphasised the glory of Rome's foundation but also which constantly worked to create links between the Greek legends of the Trojan War and the Italic myths of Rome's foundation, even when that didn't make the most logical or narrative sense."
823,AskHistorians,"Was an ""atomic bomb"" something that people at large understood was a thing that could exist prior to the Hiroshima bombing, or was its invention and use a complete surprise to everyone except cutting-edge physicists?","The potential energy output of nuclear fission was well understood prior to hiroshima and Nagisaki. Moreover theoretical concepts like criticality, supercriticality and nuclear chain reactions all appeared in publically published papers prior to the outbreak of war. Further, by the late 30s several different institutes were working on creating a self sustaining nuclear fission reaction.


Had it not been for the outbreak of war it is likely that a civilian scientific reactor would have popped up in the 40s. However outbreak of war meant that research very quickly went very secret, as at least the majority of scientists working in the field were aware of the potentially catastrophic power of the atom. The most famous demonstration of this is the Einstien-Szilard letter to Roosevelt that warned of the potential power of an ""atomic weapon"". 

Thus every major power had at the very least a cadre of academics who understood that it should be possible to create a supercriticalty reaction that would unleash a truly terrifying amount of energy. In the US we were so certain that the cannon type uranium fueled bomb would work that we didn't even test it (there was also the issue of each cannon type requiring several months national production of u-235, more on that later). The implosion type Plutonium bomb was tested at Trinity, but that was more a question of if the conventional explosive shell could be detonated precisely enough to induce supercriticality in the Pu core.

The manhattan project was never strictly a question of determining if a nuclear explosion was possible (everyone was pretty certain it was), it was a question of a)if you could build a device to deliver that reaction precisely where and when you want it, the bomb (though obviously precision is a relative term when what you are delivering is an 8 kiloton explosion) and b)producing enough sufficiently pure uranium or plutonium to produce your supercriticality. Fuel production actually took up the majority of the Manhattan  Project's budget and efforts


When the first fireball bloomed over Japan the reactions from the major powers was thus not ""what was that?"" But rather ""dear god the Americans actually cracked it"". Everyone knew it was theoretically possible, but not how close it was. 

Perhaps more directly pertinent to your question, the concept of an ""atomic weapon"" actually appears in the public conciousness as early as 1914, in H.G. Wells ""The World Set Free"" a book about a world war ended with atomic weapons that operated by accelerating radioactive decay in a substance, expelling vast amounts of energy in a brief period of radioactive fire, with the side effect of contaminating the land it was used on for many years. While obviously Wells work was innacurate in the method, it was prophetic in depicting the effects of nuclear weapons, and implanted the idea of the atomic bomb into the public conciousness. Leo Szilard, father of fission, was even known to have read the book. I myself wonder if nightmares of Wells atomic fire danced through his head the night he first saw those blips of neutrons dancing on the oscilloscope.

Edit:the US also built a working uranium reactor in 42, so they were 100% certain that criticality was possible before they ever built a bomb."
824,AskHistorians,Why is there no mention of Alexander the Great in the bible?,"As far as I know we simply will not have any particular reason to give to that.

Now, [hillsonghoods](https://www.reddit.com/user/hillsonghoods) mentions two good points in his post when an answer was removed: (a) there's not one canon (b) the process by which we end up with certain texts needs to be discussed. And he helpfully points out a passage in which a Biblical text does mention Alexander the Great.  I will largely focus on the second point I mention, but not in a definitive way. Rather, that point got me thinking about the difficulties that seem to come with the question (especially as I tried to find research I had access to that might offer more helpful answers and I continually came up with nothing)

I'll preface my quick response with a quick note: I suggest crossposting this [/r/AskBibleScholars](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBibleScholars) since there are some people who will know a lot about this topic. But I will also quickly add that the text we have already had mentioned is from 1 Maccabees, a text which does not appear in the Protestant Bible but does appear in Orthodox and Catholic Bibles. The process by which the canon had some alterations (namely, Protestants viewed some texts as less-inspired or not-inspired and removed them from their canon and, overtime, largely stopped reading them) is, I think, what hillsonghoods was getting at.

Another thing to consider is that 1 Macacabees is one might call an intertestamental book -- meaning it was composed sometime between the Old Testament and the New Testament (though it would be considered part of the Old Testament in some traditions). This is relevant because 1 Maccabees is a later text (written about the time after Alexander the Great had died, in particular). I suspect OP's question is concerned with why contemporary texts in the Bible don't mention him. A quick look at the common dating of books suggests that the texts which were written around Alexander's reign are Chronicles (dealing with the history of the North and South kingdoms), a smattering of wisdoms texts (Job, Ecclesiastes), and sections of Psalms. And perhaps Ezra and Nehemiah were starting to take shape. If you were to ask me what texts I would expect to speak about such a figure, I would say ""history or prophetic texts"" but the texts that are commonly thought to originate from that time all pretty insular in focus (history of the people and a record of the restoration of the people in the land). If common dating of texts is correct, the question is really why weren't more prophetic texts being composed or preserved  during this time?

Bradley Gregory, in ""Historical Candidates for the fallen King in Sirach 10,10"" (from *Zeitschrift Für Die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft* 126, no. 4 (2014): 589-591) believes that Sirach 10:10 (""A long illness baffles the physician; the king of today will die tomorrow,"" New Revised Standard Version) is a reference to Alexander the Great and writes:

>The significance of Alexander’s fatal illness for Jews living much later is confirmed by the brief account of Alexander the Great in  1 Maccabees in which the  author’s  main point about Alexander is that his illness, described as »falling on his bed«, was a reversal of his arrogance, described  as  having  a  heart that was »exalted and lifted up« (p. 591)

Gregory's article is sadly short (he's mostly just suggesting a possible figure to consider), but he believes that in the original languages there's also commonality between the Sirach passage and 1 Maccabees. Yet I believe Gregory's potential solution to a minor quandary (does 10:10 refer to a specific monarch?) raised another question: if Alexander's perceived arrogance was so well-known that this would have been seen as a clear reference to him, why do we not have more Jewish literature concerning him? To which there is no clear answer. I tried to do a search to see if there are non-biblical, religious texts from the Jewish people that mention him but that's outside of my realm of expertise.

And I'm not sure there will be answers on this question that do not go into speculation. Because the question can easily because why do the Jewish holy texts not mention this figure? And my speculative answer is simply that the scope of Tanakh was, for some unknown reason, codified so that Alexander the Great seems outside of the scope. The histories we have and the prophetic texts which we have are largely dealing with pre-exilic realities and the final books concern the restoration of the people to the land and the rebuilding of the Temple. One could hypothesize that these were deliberate choices made by the priestly class, but we do not know if this is the case. One could assume there is a narrative unity that ultimately runs thought the Old Testament, but this would also be speculation. And would open the question as to why the canon was codified in such a way, why did their canon close when it did?

And part of this issue is simple: the process by which some texts are codified and others are not is not a clear process. Brennan W. Breed, in *Nomadic Texts: A Theory of Biblical Reception History*, discusses the fluidity of text in the Second Temple period: even if certain texts were agreed to be holy which version of that same text was considered authoritative was not agreed upon (in a modern analogy it'd be like if I decided to read from The Message in my church, where Scripture reading is explicitly done from either the New International Version or the New Revised Standard Version; The Message is not seen as an adequate representation of the word of God, but in other churches it might be). Yet Breed's argument makes this conversation even more difficult. Because he also is pretty firm on the idea that the idea of a canon is an anachronistic category to impose upon ancient Judaism (p. 48-9) and highlights the variety of textual traditions and differences in which ""the earliest version \[of a text\] was both copied and altered by... successive communities, each with their own distinction theological perspective"" (p. 21). Which only highlights: why do we not know of Judaic traditions who were engaging in this process with their religious texts to decry or praise Alexander the Great? Why is it not until after his death that Judaism seems to find him particularly noteworthy?

Which also highlights why this issue becomes even more bizarre: there is not a monolithic Judaism that we can look to the past and say ""there, that's THE Judaism."" We know there was a plurality of Judaisms with people that were writing. We find manuscripts or references to texts that we do not have, we have competing views of what counts as the Old Testament (is 1 Maccabees a holy text or not?), yet we do not find more references. Did Alexander the Great not strike the Jewish people as noteworthy? Was his reign simply in an era where the Jewish people were, by and large, not writing too many works? Were works referencing him largely lost? Are there perhaps coded references to him in texts (akin to how Rome might be referenced through allusions and metaphor in later apocalyptic texts)?  


(Added: to that last question, some do believe that Daniel contains obscure references to Alexander the Great:

>ALEXANDER THE GREAT -- the king of Macedonia, the great conqueror; probably represented in Daniel by the “belly of brass” (Dan. 2:32), and the leopard and the he-goat (7:6; 11:3)

from M. G. Easton, Easton’s Bible Dictionary (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1893); it's an assertion I've come across elsewhere).

This is all a long way to say that I'm simply not sure if there's an answer we can get to. I think any answer will raise more potential question. It's a difficult answer to give, especially when Alexander the Great seemed to have made an impact with their neighbours."
825,AskHistorians,How effective was the gattling gun when it made its first appearance on the battlefield? Movies like the Last Samurai and the (new) Magnificent 7 make it seem like it was an unstoppable devastating force. What impact did it have on warfare?,"It was very effective. There are several examples of its effectiveness, particularly in the many battles where European forces expanded or consolidated their empires.

In the 1870s and 1880s the British used the gatling gun against African tribes armed primarily with spears in the Anglo-Zulu and Anglo-Ashanti wars (specifically the 3rd Anglo-Ashanti war in this case) and against forces with firearms and canons in the Anglo-Egyptian war (1882). In the battle of Tel-el-kabir (Anglo-Egyptian war) for example, the British managed a 50:1 ratio in Egyptian dead vs. their dead (2000 to 39), partially due to the use of gatling guns. In the Battle of Ulundi (Anglo-Zulu war, 1879) the British were outnumbered nearly 3:1 but through the use of two gatling guns and canons firing cannister shot were able to win the battle with a huge mismatch in fatalities (fewer than 20 killed on the British side, nearly 500 dead on the Zulu side).

In a particularly noteworthy example there is the Battle of San Juan Hill during the Spanish-American War (1898). While assaulting Kettle Hill 3 gatling guns were employed to provide continuous suppressive fire against the Spanish, allowing American forces to advance up the hill in what would have otherwise been suicidal conditions. In a period of about 8 and a half minutes three guns expended about 18,000 rounds, indicating the gatlings were in near continuous use during that period of time. After the Americans had taken the hill and while the gatling guns were being repositioned to the top of San Juan ridge a hasty counter-attack by about 600 Spanish soldiers was cut down with fire from just a single gatling, killing nearly the entirety of the force in a matter of minutes.

There are many other contemporary examples. Suffice it to say that the gatling gun was quite effective under the right conditions and effectively destroyed the potential for massed frontal assaults (even with favorable numbers of soldiers). That doesn't mean it was an unstoppable devastating force in all cases, it had its limitations just as any weapon does, but it was quite devastating in the few specific cases where it could shine (open ground, large numbers of close packed enemy troops).

The impact it had on warfare was to make frontal charges much less effective. It and its successors (the Maxim gun and other fully automatic machine guns) drove warfare increasingly toward the WWI model: trenches and fortifications across a front-line that was in most cases suicide to attempt to cross, even en masse. And that eventually led to modern combined arms tactics, the employment of artillery, small arms, light machine guns, grenades, mortars, mobile armor (tanks, APCs, AFVs, etc.), and even aircraft in a carefully coordinated assault. And, incidentally, the demise of cavalry (though artillery is also a significant contributing factor there)."
826,AskHistorians,"The Founding narrative of the United States gives a lot of attention to Jamestown (1607) and Plymouth (1620), but Newport News (1613) and Hampton, VA (1610), and Albany, NY (1614) were founded in the same era, are much larger cities, but get much less attention. Why aren’t they as relevant?","There are a lot of ""first"" cities that have been forgotten in time, but let's look at the ones you listed.

Jamestown, 1607 - We teach and talk about this one because it was the first Anglo settlement to remain permanently. It wasn't really financially successful, it was abandoned at one point, and everyone almost died. But they didn't and it stayed populated until established. Even less known is the sister colony to Jamestown also started by the Virginia Company (of Plymouth, the other branch from the Va Co of London that started Jamestown) that failed. Because, of course, it failed. Somewhat popular is the first failed civilian Anglo colony on Roanoke Island, but less known is the previous colony also set up by Sir Walter Raleigh on Roanoke and abandoned a few years earlier. It wasn't permanent so it doesnt get any sunshine in history class. The only reason we care about the 2nd Roanoke is because it failed as the first attempted permanent civilian colony (and the side story/legends behind America's first Anglo child, Virginia Dare and Croatan). We care about Jamestown because it was the first that worked.

Hampton, 1610 - Simply put, what makes it special? A strategic point and great land to develop, but it wasn't first. It didn't have the same struggle story as Jamestown. In fact Christopher Newport and the Jamestown originals identified that spot and came back in 1609 to build a fort. So it was even started by the same people, but it wasn't their first.

Newport News, 1613 - While Jamestown was struggling in June 1609, Christopher Newport was racing across the Atlantic with supplies. When a 3-day storm hit the fleet the boats were scattered and Newport's crashed in Bermuda. By the time Newport dealt with his subsequent shipwreck (which also had John Rolfe, the guy who started non-native tobacco growth in Virginia a few years later) and made it to Jamestown the situation was dire. It had taken about 10 months to get there and the winter of 1609-1610 is known as the dying time and for self evident reasons - the colony nearly failed. When he arrived the palisades were gone, the buildings had been burned for firewood, and a fraction of the settlers were left. They abandoned the colony and sailed down river until they met another man that was on Newport's ship, the new Governor Thomas Gates. He ordered them to turn around and return, which they did. The spot Newport and the settlers met Gates and recieved the news about returning with Gates and his supplies became, as you've now guessed, Newport News. Cool story, but it still wasn't first and was again the same people.

Albany, 1614 - Here we have the Dutch, who hired a guy named Henry Hudson that has some stuff named for him to do some exploring for a trade route, starting their first colony in America. The didn't hold on to it very long, losing it to the British in the 1660s. At that point the history of Albany became British history. It wasn't the first colony and was British - so what makes it important? If you're not Dutch, not much. It's like Fort Christina that was founded in 1638 by the Swedes. It was soon overtaken by forces from New Amsterdam, then taken by the English and even given to William Penn as part of Pennsylvania. Today we call an area very close to Ft Christina Wilmington, Delaware. But it wasn't the first Anglo colony in a land of Anglo history, so nobody knows about the fishing settlement.

Plymouth, 1620 - Now taking everything we've discussed so far, this one is obviously out of place entirely. It was started by Anglos ""in exile"" for their religion. It wasn't first. It didnt make a lot of money. It was ultimately absorbed into another colony. So why the Plymouth celebration? Humans and our need for symbolism. Plymouth faced a ""dying time"" their first winter (they started the colony construction on Christmas Day, 1620) as everything went wrong for them. Arriving off course they had no charter or structure where they were about to settle, so they wrote the first Anglo charter in the new world, the Mayflower Compact in November 1620 before scouting for a location. About half the settlers died by March. Then two weeks into March a Native trapper walked in and asked, in broken English, for a beer. Days later a treaty was signed and assitance offerd; that fall a harvest celebration would occur. In America today it is known as thanksgiving and was even recognized by George Washington as president. The colony remained and in 1741 a man that grew up around original colonists identified a rock as being significant - the first one the settlers stepped on according to what they personally told him, so he claimed. The Legend of Plymouth Rock was born and has captivated audiences ever since. Adding to this is the powerhouse that was Massachusetts Bay Colony, which absorbed the whole area in the late 1600s. The history then became Massachusetts Bay history, and the failed Dorchester Company of 1623 that settled at Cape Ann was absorbed into the Mass Bay Company when it formed in 1628, moving to Salem. Boston would come two years later. So Plymouth *was* the origin of Massachusetts which heavily influenced all things New England in colonial America much like Virginia did further south. 

E for grammer"
827,AskHistorians,I live in a European city where they have found lots of old houses from the 14th century burried in the city center. At what point are those houses 1/2 burried and how do people just forget that the buildings used to exist in a location that has been constantly populated since they were built?,"I love this question because it starts out seemingly negative (how do you lose a city?!) but ends up someplace positive: people can be amazingly resourceful.

Have you seen a building torn down or imploded today so something else can be built in its place? The building becomes first a pile of rubble, then a giant hole. We haul away the rubble that was the building and its foundation. Lots of it ends up in landfills. The useful parts--wires are the big one cited--might be sorted and sold as scrap.

Premodern building demolition in Europe was all about reusing what was reuseable, of course. One famous example is the piecemealing of Roman stone structures in early medieval Britain. Notre-Dame de Paris has Roman-era stone pieces in part of its foundation, and possibly some Carolingian as well. And of course, as I talk about in this cool [earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7uweo1/the_city_of_rome_had_a_population_of_over_one/dto1631/) the medieval city of Rome itself was largely built into or out of old Roman buildings!

But lacking a real-life Merlin to engineer exotic contraptions that could haul heavy building materials from Ireland to Stonehenge, medieval people tended to skip that ""gaping hole"" stage. It was logistically just plain easier to salvage what could be salvaged and then build the ground *up* to smooth over ruins to the point you could build a new structure. 

In fact, this could become part of the building itself. In one type of construction, the ground was leveled off by packing in dirt and rubble, and the stone walls were constructed right on top of it. Otherwise, a building might be constructed around stone-and-mortar piers. A foundation trench would be dug, the pier constructed up to ground level, and the space around it packed in. From both France (Cluny) and England (London), there is evidence that in some places the use of piers was practiced in religious building in the early Middle Ages and then adopted for secular construction from the twelfth century or so.

(John Schofield's excellent article ""The Construction of Medieval and Tudor Houses in London"" is available online, for anyone interested in understandable explanations of medieval construction beyond lists of basic materials. The [PDF](https://www.arct.cam.ac.uk/Downloads/chs/vol7/article1.pdf) is 41MB; caveat clickor.)

So essentially, there's not really an intermediary stage *if* a particular space is going to be continuously inhabited. For truly abandoned sites, like the cities wasted by the Mongols that didn't re-attracted residents until new settlers showed up centuries later, probably one could witness ruins half-buried in dirt deposited by wind and water. /u/kookingpot has a fabulous and fascinating post on [geoarchaeology](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3bz6zp/why_did_the_romans_build_on_top_of_things/) that discusses the natural burial of old cities as well as human-caused.

As to the lack of memory? If the buildings were also demolished in the Middle Ages or the early early modern era, it doesn't surprise me at all that there's no modern memory or record of what stood there. That's just not the kind of thing recorded in city archives. We might know from tax records or a parish register or a will that someone was a shoemaker, or a draper of secondhand fabric. We don't have a street address or the deed to a building.

And medieval (and early modern) people were pretty used to rebuilding. Medieval peasants, according to Barbara Hanawalt, built and rebuilt houses fairly frequently. In cities, fires frequently gave people no choice but to rebuild. Fear of fire was *rampant* in the Middle Ages; in handbooks for priests to help them instruct people in not sinning, arson is right next to murder as the two worst sins of Wrath. When the *libri mechanorum* gets going as a genre of literature in the 15th-16th centuries, featuring wondrous extrapolations of existing technology into helpful new machines, firefighting engines are among the most prominent. ([Here's one idea from 1594](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mjmurphy/history_of_science/besson_theatre/besson_fire_engine.jpg)). That's to say: medieval people's experience of everyday architecture was that it was necessarily *transient*.

Which always makes me wonder what medieval pilgrims to a splendor like [Sainte-Chapelle](https://blogs-images.forbes.com/ceciliarodriguez/files/2015/08/0827_FL-saint-chapelle-stained-glass_2000x1125-1152x648.jpg) thought. Did they believe it would last forever? Or did they see it crumbling into decay like, they believed, all matter in a fallen world ultimately must?"
828,AskHistorians,"The Outlander book and TV series presents a fairly high number of rapes or attempted rapes, one occurring in the very first episode - How prevalent was rape around the time of the Jacobite Rising? What were the repercussions for such an act and how did it affect the victims?","The simple fact is that we don't really know the actual incidence of rape at any point in time, even arguably today - between the need for it to be reported and the many barriers that have stood between victims of sexual assault and reporting it to local law-keepers (let alone a prosecution, especially let alone a successful prosecution), any statistics we might be able to point to from the courts would be woefully inadequate. Only a few cases for rape came to the High Court of Justiciary in Scotland over the course of the entire century, let alone the 1740s.

That being said ... there was a high incidence of rape in eighteenth century Britain in general. The term ""rape culture"" absolutely applies here - sexual assault was incredibly normalized as a part of life, with popular/folk ballads treating it as an effective means of gaining a woman's love. For instance, the broadside ballad ""In Heriot's-Walks"" (1715) ([you can read the full text here](https://digital.nls.uk/broadsides/view/?id=15993&transcript=1)) begins with the ""hero"" meeting the woman he's in love with in Heriots Wood; he tells her that he wants her and she tells him to cool it, so he says he would never, ever rape her, which leads her to allow him ""a modest, Chast, and Civil kiss"". As he comes forward, she falls down backward (he assumes on purpose) and he takes the opportunity:

> When she was down, what Mortal Creature

> Cou'd have refrain'd the yeilding Dame?

> Thus Opportunity and Nature,

> Reason and Honour Overcame,

> I gain'd my Point, through Love's Assistance,

> She blusht for my not proving True;

> Not for her own kind Non-resistance,

> What could a poor Weak Woman do?

She says she's angry, calls him rude, and threatens to scratch him, but he continues and the end of the song gives her perspective:

> I did not think you'd prove so Cruel,
> 
> As all my quiet to destroy,
> 
> Read in my eyes my grief, my Jewel,
> 
> But in my Heart my coming Joy.

The ballad is ambiguous at many points as to whether the man is only telling himself that she secretly wants this assault or whether the woman is actually flirting with him, but the ending rather explicitly states that she is genuinely hurt ... but also that the assault (or perhaps more specifically, her climax) is making her fall in love with him.

Another, ""The Coalier Lassie"" (1701) ([original here](https://digital.nls.uk/broadsides/view/?id=14501)) does not even have the excuse of depicting a single event in a somewhat ambiguous relationship, but takes the form of instructions:

> Although at first she may deny,

> yet you must pursue her:

> Her Modesty will make her cry

> your Rudeness will undo her.

> But with a forward brisk Address

> unto the point intended ;

> First you must Kiss & then Caress,

> and so the Matter's ended.

Each verse of the song is quite explicit: if you want to have sex with the bonny collier's daughter, you should just assault her and ignore her struggles and cries, because once you're finished she'll love you and happily go with you next time.

There was no clear distinction in the popular understanding between seduction and rape, with assaults committed by men who were wooing or courting a woman particularly tending to be classified as ""seduction"", with the strong implication that the woman was greatly to blame for giving in. In Scotland, although the High Court legally was the only one with jurisdiction to hear rape cases, in practice sexual assault was very frequently handled in kirk sessions as sins committed by both parties, like fornication. The many accounts from women who used their sexual assaults as evidence of marriage bear this out, as well as the normalization of rape itself. While it was neither legally binding nor sanctioned by the church, a declaration of marriage followed by consummation had been an informal means of legitimating a relationship among the non-elite for centuries, and so many women who were able to get a promise out of their attacker before being raped used the event to make a declarator-of-marriage case in court. A 1782 case featured a maidservant asking the court to uphold or enforce the marriage between herself and her employer after he had locked her in a room and violently assaulted her, then promised marriage, after which she allowed him ""every privilege of a husband"" on later occasions because she understood their relationship to have changed. (The court did not uphold the marriage, most likely because of the class disparity.)

Sussing out exactly how sexual assault affected its victims in the period is difficult, beyond the obvious fact that violence is traumatic, particularly violence as intimate as sexual assault. Many women would respond as we would expect: eighteenth-century Scottish writer Jean Marishall argued that a woman who married her ""seducer"" would live the rest of her life in fear, and some prosecuted their rapists despite the fact that publicizing their ""ruin"" would result in their remaining single or even having to turn to sex work. The many women who did continue to engage with and even marry their rapists must be regarded in context with the fact that even while emotional, affectionate relationships became more expected between husbands and wives over the course of the century, marital rape continued to be completely unthinkable as a concept: in such a society, how can pre-marital rape really be comprehended? How is *it* conceptualized? Just as we can't really know the extent of the existence of PTSD in pre-modern soldiers, we can't see into the psyches of women who had been conditioned to believe that rape could be solved with marriage, or that it was an acceptable step in courtship and a form of love. We can't know exactly how they aligned the trauma they faced and testified to with their decisions to remain close to their rapists, except to know that they were forced to.

I have here been largely discussing the situation for Scottish(/British) women throughout the century, but I should discuss the period of the Jacobite Rising more specifically, because it's important context. While I've made it clear above (I hope) that sexual assault was highly normalized in British culture when the assailant was known to and even close to the victim, rape could still seen as a form of violence and stigmatized. Scottish Highlanders were seen as completely uncivilized ""savages"", and tales that they were rapists themselves were used by their opponents to justify harsh military reprisals: they supposedly were beyond the reach of diplomacy and similar means. In 1745, John Dalrymple, the Earl of Stair and a high-ranking military officer, had suggested that rape could by used as a weapon against the wives and daughters of those Highlanders fighting against the Crown to make the men return home to defend their women, and that soldiers should simply be sent to ""live at discretion"" in the Highlands, where they might make violent nuisances of themselves and lay waste to farms and the countryside. After the Battle of Prestonpans in September of that year, the ""live at discretion"" tactic began to be adopted by commanders in the Highlands, and by the following spring it was official policy; while the soldiers were not directly encouraged to assault the women they came across, the already-existing rape culture in British society made it seem a reasonable option, particularly when crossed with beliefs about the worthlessness of Highlander lives, and they were certainly not punished in any way for it by their officers, who typically agreed with Dalrymple's suggestion. In the specific context of *Outlander*'s setting, yes, rape by British soldiers against Highland women was extremely common and was deliberately done as a form of violence to terrorize them and their families.

829,AskHistorians,Was Cleopatra's famously exaggerated beauty the work of her enemies?,"I wrote my dissertation on Roman representations of Cleopatra in Literature and there are a few issues with this statement. First of all, Roman authors tend to not actually refer to Cleopatra as beautiful. Plutarch even says she is not as beautiful as Mark Antony's Wife Octavia (Plurarch, Life of Antony section 54?). What Roman authors do tend to say about Cleopatra as that she is power hungry, sexually promiscuous, and foreign to Rome. Propertius, Elegies 3.11 describes Cleopatra as a 'woman who fornicated even with her slaves. Virgil only describes her as an 'Egyptian wife' on the verge of suicide (Virgil, Aeneid,8.709) , and Horace says she is 'drunk', 'perverted', 'in a frenzy' and 'crazed' (Horace, Odes 1.37). Plutarch  says that she spoke several languages and, more importantly, specifically says that she managed the ruling of Alexandria and Egypt well! (Plutarch, Life of Antony,  27). The idea of Cleopatra being this beautiful woman tends to come from later cinema, think Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra (for more on this I would reccomend D.W Roller (2010) Cleopatra: A biography. To say that the ancient sources give us an entirely negative view of Cleopatra is false, but it is important to remember that Cleopatra is seen against a backgrop of Foreign, specificially Eastern, decadence, and against the power systems and political powers which were allowed of women in Ancient Rome. She tends to be painted as Manipulative rather than beautiful, alluring and dangerous rather than seductive. She is painted this way because her powers, being the Pharoh of Egypt, was so so far removed from the powers which would be allowed of Roman women in the Late Republic/Early empire that there was no way to assimilate her. Therefore, she tends to be painted like this. So yes, there is an element of Rome not ebing able to process a capable woman, but Cleopatra is not, and has never been 'made' beautiful by the ancient sources, we, as a modern society, have only inferred this from the sources. But it is important to remember that Cleopatra has been credited, even in ancient times, with cleverness, and an ability to rule. ETA: DISS LINK AT BOTTOM

830,AskHistorians,"Why did France, rather than Germany, adopt the Frankish identity?","So there's a lot of layers to unpack here.  Part of this seems to be a misunderstanding of that the ""Frankish Kingdom(s)"" looks like vs. what modern France and Germany consist of as well as the actual history of how the various composite parts are conquered, divided etc. Admittedly it is *messy* so strap in! There's a fair amount of narrative here but it is necessary to help answer the deeper question you've asked.

First, to address this we need to unpack a bit of your conception about where the ""Franks"" come from and what exactly ""Francia"" is.  When the Merovingians become a going concern what we're looking at is a ""Frankish"" realm that consists of a whole lot of sub-tribes that over time get consolidated into three big semi-stable kingdoms: 

* Austrasia (the ""Old"" Kingdom) consists of territory in what is now modern day Western Germany (west of the Rhine), Alsace-Lorraine, and parts of Belgium.  This is the heart of the ""original"" Frankish territories settled in the last days of the Roman Empire when the franks were a ""federate"" ally and, incidentally, its where the Carolingians come from (more on this later). 

* Neustria (the ""New"" Kingdom) is effectively what we think of as modern day northern France and was a key part of Roman Gaul. This is territory taken over/conquered by the Franks shortly after the ""fall"" of the Empire (note: the whole Fall thing is a whole other can of worms I can't get into here). The traditional date is 486 at the battle of Soissons.

* Burgundy is conquered from the Burgundians in 534 and becomes the last of the major ""kingdoms"".

Now what about ""Franconia"" which you referred to as being the ""Frank's origin""?  In fact, Franconia, is not at all the ""origin"" of the Franks, but a territory conquered/absorbed in the 7th century on and then effectively co-opted with the name Franconia to acknowledge that it was now Frankish territory (as opposed to say, Alemanni, Swabian etc.).  So, let's put that to bed! The ""origin"" of the Franks, at least within Western Europe post-migration, is effectively Austrasia, the ""Old Kingdom,"" namely the Western Rhine Valley. Neustria is a ""close"" second.  But what about ""Germania"" and the Eastern Rhine? Where does that fit in?

To answer that and the question of why is France and not Germany the ""inheritor"" of Frankish identity we need to keep exploring the geographic evolution of Francia.

Over the next several centuries under the Merovingians and then the Carolingians (who first work for and then supplant the Merovingians) ""Francia"" (a conglomerate term for all the territory controlled by the Frankish kings) brings under its wing basically all of modern day France and Western Germany as well as Belgium, the Netherlands and of course some extra fun bits of Italy, Iberia, and Central Europe as well.  Most important for your question is Charlemagne's conquest of Saxony, the territory east of the Rhine up to the Elbe in the East. This occurs from roughly 772 until 804 and is most clearly laid out in the *Royal Frankish Annals* which is available in translation and is a great source for Frankish history.

Fast forward to the mid-9th century!

In 840 Louis the Pious, Charlemagne's successor, dies and leaves behind three sons: Lothar, Louis ""the German,"" and Charles ""the Bald.""  The last decade+ of Louis' life had been plagued with problems managing his sons, their expectations for inheritance, their frustration with their father and siblings etc. Louis weathered multiple rebellions and when he died things ""popped off"" pretty much immediately.

Lothar, who'd been co-crowned Emperor in 817, immediately attempts to take control of the entire realm, despite having been confined to Italy as the result of on-going revolts against his father and specific instructions on how the realm was to be divided among Louis' surviving children.

His younger brother Louis and half-brother Charles immediately form an alliance to prevent this from happening and after a long and *very* bloody civil war things are finally settled in 843 with the Treaty of Verdun.  The outcome is as follows:

* ""West Francia"" (basically Neustria and some parts of Burgundy) as well as Aquitaine are granted to Charles the Bald.

* ""Middle Francia"" (later called Lotharingia from whence we get the ""Lorraine"" in Alsace-Lorraine), consisting of Austrasia (the old Frankish/Carolingian heartlands), Frisia (the Nerthelands), and Belgium and most of Burgundy goes to Lothar, along with Italy.

* ""East Francia"" consisting of Saxony (the territory east of the Rhine added to the realm by Charlemagne) as well as Bavaria, Swabia, and other ""German"" bits go to Louis who thus earns himself the moniker ""the German.""

When I have students look at the map of post-843 Francia what they immediately note is that these divisions fairly nicely carve Europe into areas the correspond well to modern borders. Obviously this is a *broad* generalization but effectively West Francia looks a lot like ""France"" and East Francia looks a lot like ""Germany.""  Over time as Lotharingia gets gobbled up by the two this only becomes clearer.

So, by the late 9th century/early 10th century we have geographically gotten to a point where there are basically two competing successor realms to the Frankish Empire. The last attempt at unity, under Charles the Fat, ends in 888 and from that point on these two realms go their own separate ways never to be truly united again.  Bye bye Frankish Empire.

BUT, that doesn't answer your question of why West Francia, ostensibly the ""Latin"" Gallic area and not East Francia, with its Germanic culture, takes up the mantle.  To answer that we need to jump back in time to address another misconception and *then* jump forward again.

Let's talk about your statement that ""the latin-speaking Gauls (Galloromans) of Gallia adopted their name which still lives on as France."" Neustria, as noted, is a key area of Gaul in a way that Austrasia never was.  When the Merovingians take it over we can see clearly the ways in which they work to engage with, make use of, and co-opt Roman/Gallic culture. Clovis, notably, is baptized in 508 with the express aid of the Gallic bishop at Reims.  Major intellectual figures of the Merovingian world such as Venantius Fortunatus and Gregory of Tours are of Gallic descent as well and we can see the way they bring to bear their own Gallic identities in conjunction with and in service to the Franks.  This is all happening in the 6th-7th century. I'm doing a real hash of this in service of brevity and indeed the process by which Gauls and Franks intertwine and transform into a singular ""identity"" over time is very complex and very interesting in its own right.

Nevertheless, I point this out to give you a sense of the time-frame involved in the ""evolution"" of Frankish identity.  By the time ""West Francia"" appears in 843 it has been centuries since there has been a meaningful ""Gallic"" identity as separate from ""Frankish"" identity. Latinity is now *inherently* associated with being Frankish. As is Christianity. The Carolingians, in fact, see themselves as the heirs to Rome quite literally, especially post 800 when Charlemagne becomes Emperor and even more so under Louis who consistently styles himself as emperor.

On the other hand, ""Germany,"" that is to say ""East Francia"" across the Rhine is really only quite recently part of the Frankish World by 843. Yes there is a cultural Germanic link, but it is one that is, if anything, off-putting to the Christian Franks as they work to conquer and integrate the Saxons. One of their key goals is to Christianize the Saxons, and fundamentally the Saxons are a separate Germanic group.  The Franks, are no more from ""Germany"" in this sense then they are from ""Italy"" even though the Lombards are also a Germanic people who have been integrated into the Carolingian Empire."

832,AskHistorians,"The 13th Amendment abolished slavery, ""except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted"". Whose idea was it to add that text to the Amendment?","There were several proposals for Reconstruction Amendments as the Civil War drew to a close, including the formal constitutional abolition of slavery. The Thirteenth Amendment was a bit of a group effort, largely involving the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator John B. Henderson submitted a joint resolution to have the committee consider a constitutional amendment for abolition, kicking things off. Representatives James Mitchell Ashley and James F. Wilson offered some of the earlier versions. Other versions that were more expansive were proposed by Representative Thaddeus Stevens and Senator Charles Sumner. 

Sumner proposed the following language on February 8, 1864:

>All persons are equal before the law, so that no person can hold another as a slave; and the Congress shall have power to make all laws necessary and proper to carry this declaration into effect everywhere in the United States.

The Senate Judiciary Committee was chaired by Senator Lyman Trumbull, who wanted less expansive language and to compromise between the Radical Republicans (more liberal) and more conservative Republicans such as Lincoln who were compromise-driven. Wilson, Ashley, Henderson's proposals were incorporated into the Judiciary Committee's proposal to the Senate, which also included text from the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which created the Northwest Territories and prohibited slavery therein. This 1787 Ordinance, specifically Article 6, is where you first see the language you refer to:

>Art. 6. There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, **otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted**: Provided, always, That any person escaping into the same, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid.

Given that the Fugitive Slave Clause was to be no more, the latter bit about fugitive slaves was obviously not included. It basically incorporated everything up to the colon.

Henderson's version included language changing the amendment procedure, allowing for a simple majority in both houses as well as ratification by 2/3 of the states, which was removed by the committee. The amendment would go through a year of opposition by Southern Democrats until the Republicans gained a mandate in both houses in 1864, making the pathway to passage easier. By January 1865, Lincoln was making personal appeals to members of Congress to get passage. It passed on January 31, 1865. Lincoln signed the amendment on February 1, 1865, though this was not really required (as confirmed by a Congressional Resolution passed on February 7). It then took until December 6, 1865 to get the amendment ratified by the states (the worst stragglers were South Carolina, Alabama, North Carolina, and Georgia, though New Hampshire, Connecticut, Arkansas, and Tennessee took their time too).

834,AskHistorians,"Alfred Hitchcock lived until 1980, late enough to have seen films such as Star Wars and Alien. Is there any record of whether he saw either of them or what he thought of them?","There isn't *that* much that really can be said on this., as he wasn't exactly publishing film reviews late in life, sadly. [A fairly extensive collection of interviews that he gave can be found here](https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Category:Interviews_with_Alfred_Hitchcock), and as you can see, the final two entries are from 1977, the same year *Star Wars* came out. *Alien* came out in 1979, so of course is mentioned in none of them, and while *categorically* saying ""No"" as the answer to a question is tough, I feel it can be said with reasonable confidence we don't have any record of his thoughts in interviews on *Alien*, assuming he saw it. 

*But* a brief mention of *Star Wars* comes to us from an interview he gave to Tom Shales which was published in a number of papers. His thoughts though are fairly brief, and also not that enthusiastic, I'm sorry to say. Asked about it, he recognized its success with audiences, but the science-fiction aspects seem not to have resonated with him, noting:

>Oh yes, oh yes, I saw it. But I wondered in Star Wars  of course, with the grosses it's doing, why should one complain?  but, shooting at each other with lasers? I thought, 'Now, why do that? Bullets are so much quicker.'

Trawling through for *any* other remarks he offered turned up nothing further. There are a few interesting connections, such as Charles Lippincott, who was the publicist for *Star Wars*, and was the publicist for Hitchcock's *Family Plot*, his final film, in 1976 when he first began working with Lucas & Co. [But having listened to an interview he gave](https://youtu.be/kRBdRapPZxA?t=230), he at least makes no mention of sharing his next project with Hitchcock, so there is nothing to suggest more than mere coincidence and no further connection.

Aside from the above database, I also relied on *Hitchcock on Hitchcock: Selected Writings and Interviews* and *Alfred Hitchcock: Interviews*."
835,AskHistorians,What happened to the hundreds of people left in the American Embassy after the last helicopter out of Saigon?,"There was a significant timegap between the 'last helicopter out of Saigon' and the final PAVN push to capture the city.  Ambassador Martins was flown out at 0500 Saigon Time on April 30, with the last helicopter (carrying the last few Marine guards) left at around 0700 to 0800.  

CBS News' Ed Bradley was one of those evacuated at the embassy, and described:

>""Once inside the compound, for the Americans and those Vietnamese who managed to get in with legal documents and the many who managed entrance without, the rest was easy. It was just a matter of waiting your turn for a helicopter to take you to one of the ships on station off the Vietnamese coast.""

With Martins having ordered that only Americans be evacuated earlier that dawn, we can deduce that likely no Vietnamese were granted access to the last round of helicopter flights out to sea.

As PAVN troops were assaulting downtown Saigon at the same time, and with South Vietnam unconditionally surrendering at 10:24, we can deduce that few South Vietnamese decided to stick around at the embassy for the three hours after the last helicopter left.

The following days, PAVN forces consolidated their control in Ho Chi Minh City, with the Embassy and other government buildings being raided.  

Afterwards, as stated in the Texas Tech Vietnam Oral History Interview of Phong Xuan Nguyen (a former South Vietnamese government official who was imprisoned for five years in a reeducation canp):

>It was decreed that all the high ranking officialsof the former Saigon regime would have to report for re-education for a period of thirtydays...

Nguyen describes that his reeducation was later extended as he had been a very high ranked official.  He describes his conditons at Tu Doc prison in the South:

>Oh, it was very primitive. It was completely empty, the orphanage wascompletely empty, no furniture whatsoever and there were buildings with aluminum sheetroofing and it was just tiles, very primitive tiles as the floor. We slept on the floor andthe food was provided twice a day, lunch and dinner by the administration, very primitivetoo but we had rice.

Nguyen interestingly mentions that although familial visits were not allowed, the guards were actually South Vietnamese, who treated the prisoners very courteously.

Nguyen was later moved to a prison camp in North Vietnam, where all prisoners were directed to write a 'self-confession'.  Nguyen was later put to work alongside other prisoners; he, specifically, became a mason and designed decorative ceramics.  Other prisoners might be assigned to work in the fields or in other craftsmen roles.  He was paid a small allowance as well.

All in all, I doubt that any Vietnamese were arrested at the Embassy, but if they were high ranking officials, they likely were imprisoned in reeducation camps for anywhere between thirty days and five years.

836,AskHistorians,I’m the captain of a pirate ship in 1725. Where do I dock my ship when it needs repairs? Who repairs it? What’s the land based pirate support network and infrastructure look like? Do I rely on food/resources from plundered ships?,"I will attempt to answer two specific parts of your question and I will do so using two assumptions. 

Assumption 1) You are talking about the ""Golden Age of Piracy"" in the Caribbean or Indian Ocean. 

Assumption 2) You are a fugitive (not privateer) and cannot gain access to a dry dock by bribing a local governor or passing off as an upstanding citizen. 

With that said, the ocean could be very tough on wooden vessels and those vessels required constant cleaning an upkeep do primarily to a process called biofouling which is essentially the buildup of stuff like algae and barnacles on the ship that cause the ship to deteriorate more quickly.  You have probably observed this yourself near the water line on a dock or pier. This days nothing of the damage caused by accidents or fighting. Your whole ship could basically rot out beneath you rather quickly in warm waters like the Caribbean if you didn't care for it properly.

To clean and/or repair a ship without a dry dock, you would have relied on a process called careening.  Careening a ship is when you basically beach the ship and tilt it to gain access to one side. You could do this ideally on an object like a large (not sharp) rock on a Sandy beach at high tide.  You do this carefully and in such a way that when the tide goes out, the boat tips to the side (not all the way for obvious reasons) and you can scrub all that gunk off one side of your ship and repair any holes or whatever you've got to do. Then when the tide comes back in you are free and can go about your way.  Of course, you'll have to do it again on the other side so it's a 2 day process at least. 

In terms of labor, if you have prisoners, you could force them to do the labor but usually it would be the crew.  Pirates generally did not take prisoners as often as we think and when they did, would not keep them longer than necessary.  Also, do to reasons I'll discuss shortly, you wouldn't likely want to show prisoners (whom you intended to set free) where you do your careening. 

Now, as far as location, you have to remember that geography plays into it a lot. You are a fugitive so you need a secluded bay, not just an open beach that someone can see from the trade routes.  The bay needs to be away from ""prying eyes"" because you are pretty screwed if another ship comes and bottles you in the harbor while you are careening. If this happens your options are likely a Canon, a jungle by yourself, of the gallows. Luckily for the pirates secluded bays were all over the Caribbean and the western Indian Ocean. You can't use the same spot over and over though because once the word gets out, the Navy will show up.

Myy favorite part of all this because it is so engenious is this...  Not all of the secluded bays had an appropriate large rock or object to careen on. In fact, many did not. For this reason, pirates could capture smaller trading vessels and take them to a bay where the smaller vessel would be capsized in shallow water and its Hull used as a substitute for the large rock needed for careening. 

If a secluded bay with an appropriate rock was not available and a smaller ship also unavailable they could simply beach the boat in the sand when the tide went out.  Hook a crap ton of ropes to the boat and pull or use a tree or rock on land as an anchor to start it tipping as the tide goes out.  This was understandably a very difficult task and would be the last method preferred to the other 2 (rock or small ship) since it was more work. It may however have been the most used method since it could be done almost anywhere you had a gently sloping beach.

Whatever method you chose, the ship would be unloaded first and you'd be camping on the beach so hopefully you could find some water and food while you're were there as fresh food was hard to come by on the high seas. 

Good luck with your pirating Captain.

837,AskHistorians,Has a US president ever dramatically altered his style while in office?,"I don't know if it exactly addresses your question head on, but Abraham Lincoln dramatically changed his appearance by growing a beard, probably shortly after he was elected on 6 Nov 1860, but prior to his inauguration on 4 March 1861.

[Here is a photo on file](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2007686613/) at the library of Congress dated to 13 August 1860. Contrast that with [this photo](https://www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3a32145/), identified by the Library of Congress as the earliest surviving photograph of the 16th president with a beard, dated to ~13 Jan 1861, about two months before his inauguration. [Here he is again in February, just before leaving for Washington, showing a slightly fuller beard](http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3a09984/).

It's popularly reported that Lincoln's beard was inspired by a letter received from Grace Bedell, a young girl who saw him speak on 15 October 1860 ([the story is recounted here in this 1966 NY times article](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/08/09/80009087.html?pageNumber=31)). She proposes the following to the future president ([a scan of the original letter can be found here](https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0903/letter.html)):
> I have yet got four brothers and part of them will vote for you any way and if you let your whiskers grow I will try and get the rest of them to vote for you you would look a great deal better for your face is so thin. All the ladies like whiskers and they would tease their husbands to vote for you and then you would be President.

Lincoln's polite response dated 19 October 1860, just prior to the election, is [here](https://www.loc.gov/resource/mal.0404000/) (source - Library of Congress).
>As to the whiskers, having never worn any, do you not think people would call it a silly affectation if I were to begin it now?

I guess to get back to your question, it looks like Lincoln decided to radically change his appearance, *probably* some time between late October 1860 (before the election) and early January 1861 (post-election but before the inauguration). This is notable too, for the fact that he was the first sitting president to sport facial hair (at least from my informal examination of the official presidential portraits - which you can find [here](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/galleries/presidential-portraits) and [here](https://www.loc.gov/free-to-use/presidential-portraits/)). Not sure what the reaction was in the public but I can try to sleuth some more sources.

Hope this is an ok answer.

838,AskHistorians,Why did the public care so little about the mass murder of jews?,"**part 1**

Adapted from [an older answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6696bw/new_understanding_of_allies_knowledge_of_the/):

Knowledge about Nazi atrocities was widespread in Allied countries, both in the public and in the governments.

When the Einsatzgruppen in the Soviet Union began mass executing Jews in the wake of the German invasion, it took the Allied governments but one month to intercept, de-crypt and transcribe them. By mid-July 1941, the British government was fully aware of the activity of the Einsatzgruppen, which they reported to Berlin via HF Radio and which the British soon very able to decipher. The Einsatzgruppen Situational Reports USSR as they are known are incredibly frank and open about Nazi anti-Jewish policy in both the Reich and the Soviet Union. Take for example the first report the British intercepted, [Report No. 101](http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/einsatz/situationreport101.html) from October where concerning the massacre at Babi Jar, the Einsatzgruppen report:

> Sonderkommando 4a in collaboration with Einsatzgruppe HQ and two Kommandos of police regiment South, executed 33,771 Jews in Kiev on September 29 and 30, 1941.

This is but one of these reports where they openly state that they are killing thousands and hundred thousands of Jews.

Similarly, the Western Allies were aware of the Operation Reinhard Death Camps when they started operating in 1942. The best example for this is the so-called Höfle Telegram, a precise statistic on how many Jews had been killed in these camps until December 31, 1942 which was encrypted on an Enigma Machine and thus deciphered and intercepted by the British. While British code breakers apparently missed its relevance, the Polish government in Exile and their Commission for the Crimes against the Polish Nation did indeed pick it up in its significance and duly reported to London about it.

Especially the Polish government in Exile did a lot of further work to spread the knowledge of these crimes, going so far as to have members of the Armia Krajowa smuggle out reports from the Auschwitz Concentration Camp. And while it is right that the London government largely dismissed these reports that was not the result of disbelief necessarily but rather of the official position that it was important to concentrate on winning the war militarily in order to end this rather than focus on this particular plight too much.

That the Allied governments were aware of what was going on is also revealed by their policy surrounding the German occupation of Hungary in 1944. There for example a Swedish diplomat, Raoul Wallenberg, handed out 30.000 Swedish passports to Jews in Hungary in order to save them from deportation with the very precise knowledge that they were going to be killed. Similarly, the British government several times initiated negotiations with some of the Axis countries to save Jewish children by transporting them to Switzerland and Palestine.

As for the public in the US and the UK, they too were aware if not of the fine details, that Germany was killing Jews in large numbers. The New York Times e.g. [published an article in 2001](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/news/150th-anniversary-1851-2001-turning-away-from-the-holocaust.html) admitting to its own failure to report more prominently on the Holocaust. They wrote:

> Why, then, were the terrifying tales almost hidden in the back pages? Like most -- though not all -- American media, and most of official Washington, The Times drowned its reports about the fate of Jews in the flood of wartime news. Its neglect was far from unique and its reach was not then fully national, but as the premier American source of wartime news, it surely influenced the judgment of other news purveyors.
>
> While a few publications -- newspapers like The Post (then liberal) and PM in New York and magazines like The Nation and The New Republic -- showed more conspicuous concern, The Times's coverage generally took the view that the atrocities inflicted upon Europe's Jews, while horrific, were not significantly different from those visited upon tens of millions of other war victims, nor more noteworthy.
>
> (...)
>
> Only once did The Times devote its lead editorial to the subject. That was on Dec. 2, 1942, after the State Department had unofficially confirmed to leading rabbis that two million Jews had already been slain and that five million more were indeed ''in danger of extermination.'' Even that editorial, however, retreated quickly from any show of special concern. Insisting in its title that Jews were merely ''The First to Suffer,'' it said the same fate awaited ''people of other faiths and of many races,'' including ''our own 'mongrel' nation'' and even Hitler's allies in Japan if he were to win the war.

Following the less than enthusiastic coverage of this topic, on March 9,1943, screenwriter and Zionist Ben Hecht staged the play *We Will Never Die* in Madison Square Garden in front of 40.000 people in order to raise awareness of the plight of European Jews and then further traveled around the US with it, even winning over Frank Sinatra to participate.

In Britain too – though complicated by British media laws – the public was aware of what was going on if they chose to read the newspapers. The Daily Telegraph reported in 1942 about [traveling gas chambers](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/27/1422356585641/ab29aa28-7ed8-4c38-a45d-dc0b13072e01-bestSizeAvailable.png?w=300&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=422223adda84a80fa704ab4e1d4c2ff8), which given that the Einsatzgruppen did indeed use gas vans is surprisingly accurate. Simon Leader's 2004 [PhD Thesis on the British regional press and the Holocaust](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42016442.pdf) (pdf warning) shows that

> [British] newspapers were fully aware of the Nazis’ intention to murder all Jews under their control by December 1942. They all reported the events that came to be understood as the Holocaust, (some in extraordinary detail) but the Manchester Guardian stood apart because of the consistency of its coverage

Concerning the expressions of surprise often cited from soldiers liberating camps when they came across them, for the soldiers who liberated these camps, the abstract knowledge of horrible things occurring was something definitely present if they were avid newspaper readers. Seeing it however, was something completely different. Even Eisenhower who definitely had heard about the intel collected was still completely shocked by what he saw because, once again, knowing something exist in the abstract is something different than actually beholding it.

Something similar can be applied to Casablanca and other movies e.g. Ernst Lubitsch's *To be or not to be* (also, Casblance was based on an unproduced 1940 play *Everybody comes to Rick* that was written before the Holocaust started): In the sense that Allied publics were aware to an extent of Nazi atrocities but the actual concrete pictures and extent of it came as a major surprise once camps were actually liberated.

And the public did care (somewhat). [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/232949/american-public-opinion-holocaust.aspx) writes that:

> Americans rarely agree as overwhelmingly as they did in November 1938. Just two weeks after Nazi Germany coordinated a brutal nationwide attack against Jews within its own borders -- an event known as ""Kristallnacht"" -- Gallup asked Americans: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the Nazi treatment of Jews in Germany?"" Nearly everyone who responded -- 94% -- indicated that they disapproved.

Yet at the same time:

> Yet, even though nearly all Americans condemned the Nazi regime's terror against Jews in November 1938, that very same week, 72% of Americans said ""No"" when Gallup asked: ""Should we allow a larger number of Jewish exiles from Germany to come to the United States to live?"" Just 21% said ""Yes.""

Anti-refugee sentiment was fueled both by the lingering effects of the economic depression as well as a anti-Semitism being a far more popular sentiment back then as the Gallup article also traces with 100 new anti-Semitic organizations were founded in the U.S. between 1933 and 1941 and a variety of pro-Nazi organizations spewing hatred in public.

Once the war came around, both the British and the US governments followed the line that they didn't want the war effort to be perceived as being about saving Jews or any other European nationality. Their approach to the war effort centered around their own situation as to preempt critics of the war who had argued that Britain or the US should not get involved in such a war to save some Poles, Czechs of Jews. That's why they did mention Nazi atrocities but tended to even more highlight the struggle of and for Britain rather than for other European nations. This was strongly influenced by the above traced sentiment among the electorate. The war had to be about freedom and democracy and the threat to *us*, not necessarily to the Poles, Czechs or Jews because that would – in the governement's reasoning, not be enough to endure the hardships of war by the electorate.

839,AskHistorians,"In the movie Seven Samurai, a character accuses the samurai (all of them, as a caste of society) of destroying villages, raping women, and stealing from poor farmers. Samurai are usually portrayed as lawful -- is there any legitimacy to this accusation?","Oh yeah, there's plenty of legitimacy to this accusation. It might even be closer to the truth.

William Wayne Farris quotes Paul Varley in describing the samurai as ""extravagant, rambunctious, and lawless."" Taken from *Japan to 1600*:

>As social upstarts, samurai were ""extravagant, rambunctious, and lawless."" Having no sense of good breeding, they gambled and spent all their time partying, drinking, and engaging loose women. Legislation promulgated in 1336 tried to curb such behavior, but to little avail. Born in 1306, Sasaki served first the Hojo and then Go-Daigo. In 1335, he switched sides again and adhered to Takauji. For his service, he was named a daimyo, and ironically, helped to write the vey law codes that he came to flout so freely.
In 1340, for example, when Sasaki was throwing one of his many parties, he and his followers admired some maple trees on an excursion, so much so that they ripped the branches off the trees. The garden happened to belong to a temple headed by the brother of a retired emperor, and his servants beat the branch gatherers. When Sasaki heard about the thrashing, he led three hundred mounted soldiers back to the temple and set it on fire. The priests demanded Sasaki's head, but the Ashikaga merely ordered him into exile. On the day when he left for distant parts, Sasaki placed three hundred members of his family and retainer band in an entourage showing off the latest in martial finery, including quivers covered in rabbit skin. They brought along quantities of sumptuous food and had courtesans waiting at every inn along the exile route. It became a pleasure excursion, not the punishment for a grave crime.

Well that's just an example of a lawless samurai (and his equally lawless samurai retainers). What about pillaging, raping, and burning?

>In particular, the armies provisioning techniques inflicted considerable hardship on the populace at large. Between 1335 and 1386 there were at least seventy-one incidents of arson and harvests stolen by armies in the field. In one particularly egregious case, in Mino in 1340, samurai ""attacked residences, stole the rice and other grain laid aside as seed, so that the peasants fled and there was no cultivation going on.""

The above is from the Northern and Southern Courts period, but similar records exist back in the Genpei War and also the Sengoku. The term in Japanese for this kind of raiding of civilians is 乱妨取り (ranboudori) or 乱取り (randori). Japanese lords (or really, lords all over the world at this point) simply did not have the ability to fully supply their armies, especially with food, and so allowed or even commanded their men to just take it from the countryside. The warriors pillaged, raped, burnt, and sold people into slavery.

In the Sengoku, at least part of the reason for many daimyos' expeditions was to prevent hungry and restless samurai from eating the daimyos' own food and pillaging their own domain, and instead profit from doing it to others. For example:

>Pillage, arson, and rape took place from one end of the archipelago to the other. In western Honshu, the Mori left behind a legacy of glory arising from an annual cycle of devestation. Their armies plundered fields during the spring planting, mowed down wheat crops and interfered with farmers during the busy summer, stole the harvest in the fall, and broke into granaries, burned peasant homes, and left their victims to freeze or starve to death in the winter. At Hineno Estate in the Kinai, soldiers repeatedly burned residences, raped women, kidnapped and pressed unsuspecting cultivators into service, and pilfered peasants'personal belongings, tools, and livestock. Just west of the Kanto, Takeda Shingen was among the most creative in profiting from the war-capturing the enemy's women, children, and disabled and offering them for sale back to their relatives. Shingen's brand of war-profiteering shattered families and undoubtedly resulted in the death of many captives, even as it fed his war machine.

Even my personal favourite Sengoku daimyo, Uesugi Kenshin, despite a reputation as one of the most honourable daimyos, did this. Fujiki Hisashi noted in *雑兵たちの戦場 中世の傭兵と奴隷狩* (The Battlefield of Common Soldiers-Mercenaries and Slavers of the Middle Ages) that Kenshin's frequent eastward campaigns turned many places in Kanto into living hell. Just goes to show that, like the knights of Europe, whatever supposed honour the samurai had did not extend to commoners.

Kuroda Nagamasa ordered screens to be painted of the Siege/Battle of Osaka in 1615. [The screen depicting the aftermath of the fall of the castle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/The_Siege_of_Osaka_Castle2.jpg/1920px-The_Siege_of_Osaka_Castle2.jpg) shows the absolute chaos as the people tried to run and escape the absolute slaughter. Stephen Turnbull in his work on the Siege of Osaka quotes the letter of Richard Cocks:

>Also we have had great troubles and wars in Japan since our arrival, which hath put us to much pains and charges in sending up and down to save our goods, and yet for all that some is lost and burned, two great cities being burned to the ground, each one of them being almost as big as London and not one house is left standing, the one called Osaka and the other Sakai; and, as is reported, above 300,000 men have lost their lives on the one part and other.

Things were so bad that many villages and commoners came together in armed groups and fortified their villages to resist. At any point they could, they got back at the samurai, finding small bands and assaulting, killing them, called 落ち武者狩り (ochimushagari). Even big names fell victim to these bands, most famously Akechi Mitsuhide getting killed on the retreat from his defeat at Yamazaki. Some villages and bands came together under the banner of Ikko buddhism, and some even grew to such sizes they kicked out the daimyos all together ruled their own domains."
840,AskHistorians,"Why did Albania become so ""different"" from the rest of Europe?","Let’s differentiate some things: Albania as a country is not the same as Albanians as a people or Albanian as a language. There are overlaps, but just like with every country, not everything fits within neat borders.

First of all, Albania as a country is relatively recent, only declared independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912. The borders of the new country were initially not accepted in the [Conference of London of 1912-1913](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos145.htm), so they were redrawn leaving a significant number of Albanian people outside the national borders, most notably in the region today known as Kosovo, which is why a majority of people from Kosovo identify as Albanian too. Kosovo as a country is even more recent, they declared independence from Serbia in 2008, a move that’s controversial to say the least. Both of them have differences because they lived under different systems for over a century, but they are still considered the same ethnic group. Yet, the cultural differences are there, so you have to be more specific on what do you mean. Something that you percieve as distinctly Albanian, might be a Kosovo Albanian feature, not Albania proper. 

Secondly, the Albanian people have been [first mentioned](http://www.albanianhistory.net/1000_Origins-of-Nations/) *under this name* since the [11th cenutry AD](http://www.albanianhistory.net/1038_Attaleiates/) in Bulgarian sources as “half-believers”,  i.e non-Orthodox Christians and we are told that its speakers already made a distict community from their neighbours Croatians, Bulgarians and Greeks. No information given on the other neighbours, Serbs, someone with more knowledge can expand on this:
>  can be seen that there are various languages on earth. Of them, there are five Orthodox languages: Bulgarian, Greek, Syrian, Iberian (Georgian) and Russian. Three of these have Orthodox alphabets: Greek, Bulgarian and Iberian. There are twelve languages of half-believers: Alamanians, Franks, Magyars (Hungarians), Indians, Jacobites, Armenians, Saxons, Lechs (Poles), Arbanasi (Albanians), Croatians, Hizi, Germans.

while in Byzantine sources as former allies of Byzantines. Albanians were described as living in what we today can approximate it as Eastern Adriatic coast, which today includes Central and Northern Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia:
> Unfortunately, the people who had once been our allies and who possessed the same rights as citizens and the same religion, i.e. the Albanians and the Latins, who live in the Italian regions of our Empire beyond Western Rome, quite suddenly became enemies when Michael Dokenianos insanely directed his command against their leaders... 

We aren’t given any more information on where exactly in the Eastern Adriatic though, but there is a community of *Arbanasi* people as north as  Zadar region of Croatia ([Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbanasi_people) if /r/AskHistorians mods will allow, just to show their existence), while Albanian epic verse treats Udbina (in Croatia), as the northernmost “border” where Albanians could be found. While this is not a definitive answer to anything, it shows Albanians have historically have been rather spread out, more reason we cannot limit the history of Albanians only to the country of Albania.

Thirdly, there is also Albanian as a language. Despite being a language that was written down relatively late, there has been a lot of reasearch on Albanian language. 

For example, it is generally accepted that Albanian language was spoken in the Balkans before Slavic migrations in the 6th century AD, and even before Roman expansion in the 2nd century BC. We can say Proto-Albanian and Ancient Greek were spoken near, but not next to each other, even though Albania and Greece today share a border. There are clearly loanwords from Ancient Greek (in particular Doric dialect) to Proto-Albanian and vice-versa [since 7th century BC according to this paper](https://www.academia.edu/31212816/The_earliest_Alhanian_loanwords_in_Greek), but they weren’t in direct contact because these loanwords are not numerous enough. We can thus assume there were other languages in the Balkans spoken between Ancient Greek and Proto-Albanian, but those two were coexisting at least. 

Linguists have studied in depth the Albanian language to figure out where was it originally spoken, an example would be Vladimir Orel *A Coincise Historical Grammar of Albanian Language* where he narrows done the place of origin by looking at the evolution of the language, comparing it with other IE languages, comparing regional/areal features that affect languages when they are spoken near each other even if they are not related genetically etc. and they generally fluctuate between these three theories: Illyrian, Dacian, Thracian. 

Notice, I used “under this name” for Albanians before. That’s because the terms “Albania”, “Albanian” weren’t always the name Albanians were known as. That’s just the name they called themselves from at least 11 century to the 17th one. It generally accepted it comes from a city that in Greek was known as [Albanopolis](https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_4ksBAAAAMAAJ#page/n229/mode/1up) where a people called *Albani* lived, recorded in the 2nd century AD. Post-17th century, Albanians began to call themselves *Shqiptarë*, the language *shqip*, and the country *Shqipëria*. The point is, even though we don’t have enough information on Albanians, even though we cannot connect them with an ancient Balkan group of people with certanity, we still have enough to say they have been a distinct group of people for as long as we can tell. Distinct from Greeks, distinct from Romans, distinct from Slavs. 

So, they didn’t become distinct because of the Ottoman Empire, though since culture and people always evolve, the Ottoman Empire most certainly affected them too. Robert Elsie’s *The Tribes of Albania: History, Society and Culture* can answer your question on both clans and influence of Ottoman Empire: Albanian clans are a direct result of the fall of feudalism in the region caused by the expansion Ottoman Empire, not some ancient culture preserved to modern day; it’s a reorganization of society fell. So, yes, the Ottoman Empire did affect Albanian culture in making them “different.” "
841,AskHistorians,Is Indiana Jones a good archeologist or is there some things he isn’t doing right?,"*(This is an extension of my thoughts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/2lx5eh/indiana_jones_would_be_considered_a_looter_why/clzcof1/))*

From the available biographical evidence, we have every reason to believe that Indiana Jones is a good archaeologist. I've previously covered [what training Indiana Jones would have received](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3qdkcs/what_kind_of_history_would_indiana_jones_have/cwecjyq/), what professors he would have had, and who his colleagues might have been. I've also looked into [what kind of school he taught at](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7bg4il/in_indiana_jones_and_the_raiders_of_the_lost_ark?sort=confidence)

However, not much more can really be said about Indiana Jones' archaeological methodology, because we rarely see him in anything but extraordinary circumstances. The majority of the films are about him acquiring precious or powerful artifacts before someone nefarious does:

* The Hovitos idol in the opening of *Raiders*, which Indy must get before Beloq
* The Ark of the Covenant in *Raiders*, which Indy must find before the Third Reich uses it to conquer the world
* The Sankara stone in *Temple of Doom*, which Indy must recover (there's nothing vageuly archaeological in the whole film, the entire film is set in towns/palaces/temples that are still in use)
* The cross of Coronado in the opening of *Last Crusade*, which Indy tries to steal from looters
* The Holy Grail in *Last Crusade*, which Indy must again reach before a Nazi officer uses it
* The eponymous *Crystal Skull*, which Indy must steal back from the Soviets

The only instance where we see Dr. Jones doing any kind of research or, really, any kind of search that he instigated himself, is at the start of *Raiders*. The opening shots clearly show a well-equipped team loaded with all kinds of equipment for a proper excavation. It's not long before Indy realizes something is up. He takes Satipo alone into the Hovitos temple, and proceeds through it with extreme caution, showing the requisite skills for any archaeologist: keen observation, knowledge of the cultural context, and careful steps to avoid damaging the architecture or himself. Fully aware that there are less scrupulous people after him, Indy is very much in the right to take the idol and leave. Soon he is betrayed and captured, and we're left without knowing anything else of Indy's own interests.

I'll admit that Indy's trek into the rat-infested tomb under Venice shows him in a more negative light- he rips some burial cloth for a torch. But when he and Elsa reach the knight's sarcophagus, Indy does a non-destructive rubbing of the lid, which, given the time constraints and non-feasibility of photography, seems reasonable. 

Indiana Jones is not a tomb raider because we never see him to set out to raid tombs. He clearly meant to do much more at the Hovitos temple than was actually done. He takes the Ark of the Covenant, or attempts to, so that the Nazis can't access the full power of God. He steals the Sankara stone back from the murderous cult that stole it from its proper owners. The entire point of the *Last Crusade* is that Indy is not interested in the goose chase that his father has gotten caught up in, but in spite of this must take a literal leap of faith to save his father and prevent the Nazis from getting the key to immortality. **If the question is tomb raiding or all-powerful Nazis, the correct answer is tomb raiding.**

If he's not a tomb raider, then what is he?

The Indiana Jones films are explicitly modeled after the pulp magazines, radio shows, and early comic books of the 1930s-1940s, as well as the adventure novels of the preceding decades. There's a clear inspiration for Indy in Allan Quartermain, Professor Challenger, and Doc Savage: characters whose bravado or inquiry lead to run-ins with exotic tribes, Lost Worlds, and ancient legendary ruins. This is the same tradition that gave us the secret identity: The Spider was >!Richard Wentworth!<, The Shadow was >!Kent Allard!<, and Batman was >!Bruce Wayne!<. In a literary sense, Indiana Jones falls right into this trope. He's a vigilante who hides his activities from the public, but is known by an elite few for his exploits and by a trusted team of supporting allies. 

For this reason, I would argue that Indiana Jones is an archaeologist in the same way that Hal Jordan is an Air Force pilot or Peter Parker is a news photographer. Hal Jordan's pilot skills help him as a Green Lantern just as Indiana Jones' archaeology skills help him as an adventurer. The stories we see about him don't show him in his civilian career, but in pulp hero mode.

But what of the archaeology of it?

What Dr. Jones is doing is what we would call surface collection or salvage archaeology. Before any excavation, and sometimes during the initial survey and registration of a site, a team will collect artifacts that can be found on the surface, This will be done systematically and unobtrusively. Some archaeologists will plot transects (i.e. parallel, regularly spaced lines) that a team will walk across to record features, identify locations of high artifact concentration, and, as necessary, collect surface artifacts. Other projects prefer to this in grids, plotting out regular boxes that can be then assigned values. In either case, should artifacts be collected, their original location will be noted on a hand drawn map or with a GPS point, and they will often be photographed in situ. 

Why would archaeologists do this? 

First of all, because these artifacts are on the surface, it is unlikely that they are what we call a ""primary deposition,"" that is, where the culture that used it left. It is likely a case of secondary deposition, decontextualized by burrowing animals, erosion, or agricultural activity. Thus, we only lose so much information by collecting it. There is an entire disciple called ""taphonomy"" that is dedicated to the study of how things end up where they do, but, even then, the amount of taphonomic information on the surface is limited.

Second, surface artifacts are very helpful for understanding a site before excavation, and therefore directing where further research takes place. Excavation is costly and destructive, and should be done as little as possible. Archaeologists want to be sure that any excavation they do will offer useful data. The form of artifacts can inform what kind of activities were happening in area, their style can help date the site, and their area of distribution can help define the coverage of habitation.

Lastly, surface collection can be necessary in areas where looting is a real and present danger. An archaeological dig is a beacon for looters. In my own work, I've returned to an operation in the morning and found shovels and stacks of ceramic sherds left by lazy looters in nearby tombs. When artifacts are sitting in the open and looters are known to be active, it is much better to extensively document those artifacts and collect them than it is for them to be looted and never seen again.

Thus, in the situation where a golden idol is sitting on a pedestal at a site you're about to excavate with a series of spikey traps in front of it, *you grab that idol.*

I mentioned salvage archaeology because that's the closest real-world correlate to getting the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do. There's an entire commercial field of archaeology called contract archaeology or Cultural Resource Management (CRM). In many countries, before major construction can begin, a contractor must submit an impact statement showing that the construction will not have a substantial environmental or geological impact. They must also prove that it won't have detrimental archaeological impact. If the state is building a highway bypass, or an electrical company is building a new line, or a town wants to institute a new technological park, they will hire a CRM team to survey the land that will be built on. We go out, dig a series of test pits, and look for any evidence of occupation. This is quick and dirty work. On my best days I could dig 25 of these ""Phase 1"" test pits. Unlike the slow, careful survey I describe above, Phase 1 CRM surveys try to cover as much ground as possible as quickly, but as orderly, as possible. You dig a hole (something like 30cm x 30cm, and down until you hit bedrock or sterile clay), you record the soil strata, and mark if you found any cultural material. Then you move on. When a hole is positive, you might dig some more in a grid around it. If there's a large cluster of positive test pits, you might move on to Phase 2: carefully excavating 1m x 1m test squares to identify cultural features (e.g. post holes, trash pits). If you've got cultural features, a Phase 3 excavation might be begin- you've got a site!

You've also (usually) got a mad construction company. One week you're excavating is one week they're not building and one week their client has to wait. The fact that any archaeological survey is happening is great. But the pressure is always there to get moving so other folks can get building. There are great CRM firms, and I was privileged to work for an incredible one. There are also terrible ones. But in both cases, you are operating with the knowledge that everything you see is about to be destroyed to make way for a road, building, or parking lot. That means that if we do a Phase 2 operation and don't find any cultural features, we go in with a bulldozer to scrape away huge swaths of dirt 10cm at a time. Is this destructive? Heckin' duh. But it's exactly what's going to happen to the land anyways. It's a last ditch effort to find and salvage any cultural material that may be there.

842,AskHistorians,"In 1829 the president of Mexico was a black man, Vicente Guerrero. Did he ever visit the United States and have issues due to his race?","I doubt Vicente Guerrero ever visited the United States, but I will let someone who is more knowledgeable about that specific detail to address it.

What I would like to address, though, is a related topic which is the racism that Vicente Guerrero likely experienced in Mexico. Spanish colonial racial hierarchy and classification was very different than the racial black-white binary we know from US history. For example, a black man at the end of the colonial period in Mexico could be a slave or free, but regardless he belonged to the ""Kingdom of the Spanish"", and did not belong to the subordinate ""Kingdom of the Indians."" Also a black man, up until the 19th century could enroll in the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico, and join the army (contrast this with the situation in the US). The effect of all of this is that there was perhaps a surprising social mobility in Mexico for black men, as compared to the US. 

Add to this general context the fact that Vicente Guerrero was president of Mexico before the age of photography and would not have been seen in person by the majority of the population. Notice also that in paintings made of him, stereotypical black features were either downplayed (I suspect this is true) or that he was also of European and Indigenous descent (also highly probable). Now, finally, add to that that he distinguished himself in the military and came to the presidency for the first time less than 2 years after Mexican Independence, but already after over 10 people had preceded him in power. Important to note here is that he was not voted into office. To say the least, it was an extremely volatile political moment in which many people were parading through the highest office. 

What I am saying is that Vicente Guerrero almost certainly suffered what we would today identify as racism for being black. But what complicates that statement is that anti-black racism in Mexico has historically functioned differently than elsewhere, because of the legacy of Spanish racial categories, because of a notion of racial mixing (mestizaje), because of the history of colonizing an area with a very large indigenous population, because of the history of forcibly immigrating fewer African slaves than in United States and the Carribean, and because black Mexicans were for the most part not formally barred from institutions such as the University and the army.

843,AskHistorians,"When America was switching from whale oil lanterns to kerosene, were there protests and politicians promising to keep America on whale oil, and keep whalers employed?","You may be interested in [this paper](http://myslu.stlawu.edu/~grepicky/energy/articles/Energy%20Prices%20and%20Resource%20Depleation.pdf) by Ugo Bardi. While not strictly speaking history, it is an ecological economics study of the history of the whale industry and the process of substitution. Bardi's conclusion is that the end of the whale industry was largely caused by depletion of the whale population which caused whalers to travel further and longer for less reliable catches and less about the birth of the oil industry. There's a few important take aways. 

- Peak whale was likely somewhere around 1849. By [1879 Starbuck notes that the whalers are finding catches more difficult and that longer voyages, longer cruise times and more expensive outfittings are the norm in his time](https://books.google.ca/books/about/History_of_the_American_Whale_Fishery.html?id=zGYRAAAAYAAJ&redir_esc=y). 

- Looking at inflation adjusted prices for whale products there are huge drops in prices between 1850 and 1860 (Graph on page 3). However, these drops are from all time price highs. The bottom of the price collapse in the mid-1870's is only slightly lower than the highest average yearly price for any year before 1850. As such the price doesn't so much collapse as it does rise as whale depletion starts to affect the price.

- [Alcohol blends began to dominate the lighting oil market as early as 1830](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_alcohol_fuel). They were substantially cheaper than whale oil. Whale oil was a premium product which already had lower priced alternatives namely 'Camphene' (a mix of camphor, alcohol and turpentine), lard oil and coal oil. [Camphene was the leading lamp oil with something in the area of 200 million gallons per year while whale oil peaked at around 18 million gallons. ](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/this-post-is-hopelessly-long-w/). ""By the late 1830s, alcohol blends had replaced increasingly expensive whale oil in most parts of the country. It “easily took the lead as the illuminant” because it was “a decided improvement on other oils then in use,” (especially lard oils) according to a lamp manufacturer’s “History of Light.”  By 1860, thousands of distilleries churned out at least 90 million gallons of alcohol per year for lighting. 22   In the 1850s, camphene (at $.50 per gallon) was cheaper than whale oil ($1.30 to $2.50 per gallon) and lard oil (90 cents per gallon). It was about the same price as coal oil, which was the product first marketed as “kerosene” (literally “sun fuel”)."" ( Kovarik, 1998)

- Rock oil (kerosene) was only marketed as lamp oil in the 1860's 15 years after the peak in whaling in 1849. Kerosene was more of a direct competitor to Camphene than to whale oil in price and market niche. At this point there are no cost savings between camphene and kerosene as they are priced more or less the same. 

- In 1862 and 1864 a $2.08 tax on alcohol was implemented raising the price substantially. This raised the costs of Camphene just as the equivalently priced kerosene enters the market. ""The imposition of the internal-revenue tax on distilled spirits … increased the cost of this ‘burning fluid’ beyond the possibility of using it in competition with kerosene..,” said Rufus F. Herrick, an engineer with the Edison Electric Testing Laboratory who wrote one of the first books on the use of alcohol fuel."" (Kovarik, 1998)

- ""the American alcohol tax meant that kerosene became the primary fuel virtually overnight, and the distilleries making lamp fuel lost their markets. The tax “had the effect of upsetting [the distilleries] and in some cases destroying them,” said IRS commissioner David A. Wells in 1872. “The manufacture of burning fluid for lighting suddenly ceased; happily, it was replaced by petroleum, which was about to be discovered.”  Similarly, C.J. Zintheo, of the US Department of Agriculture, said that 90 million gallons of alcohol per year were used for lighting, cooking, and industry before the tax was imposed. Meanwhile, use of oil shot up from almost nothing in 1860 to over 200 million gallons in 1870. “The effect was disastrous to great industries, which, if [they were to be] saved from ruin, had to be rapidly revolutionized,” according to Irish engineer Robert N. Tweedy. "" (Kovarik again)

In short the idea that kerosene replaced whale oil is something of a myth. Whaling largely collapsed due to depletion and over hunting. Whale oil was a premium product that was largely replaced by camphene and then kerosene and then the electric light not by kerosene directly. Kerosene enters the market in large part due to a political decision to tax one of it's competitors principle ingredients, alcohol.

844,AskHistorians,Why did people write much more eloquently 150 years ago?,"To add one small element in support of r/PSUProfOnGrindr’s analysis about the importance of what kind of eloquence was taught in any particular era, probably the most influential American schoolbook of the first half of the 19th century was Caleb Bingham’s *The Columbian Orator,* whose subtitle announced that it was “calculated to improve youth and others in the ornamental and useful art of eloquence.” A Boston educator, Bingham published the work in 1797, and it rapidly went through about 23 editions. (It was a sequel to his earlier textbook, *The American Preceptor: Being a Selection of Lessons for Reading and Speaking*, which likewise sold several hundred thousand copies and was still being taught in 1875.)

*The Orator* was a collection of 84 excerpts from famous speeches, essays, poems, and plays from orators and writers such as Cicero, Cato, John Milton, David Garrick, William Pitt, George Washington, Ben Franklin, and others plus some original dialogues. In his autobiography, Frederick Douglass wrote about how he encountered it in 1830 as a 12-year-old Baltimore slave boy recently forbidden to learn to read by his masters. He pored over the copy he managed to buy and was profoundly struck by both its lessons in the power of language and its abolitionist sympathies, particularly in the “Dialogue between a Master and a Slave.” “Every opportunity I got, I used to read this book,” he wrote. When he escaped to the north in 1838, it was probably the only book he took with him. Its training in oratory surely left their mark on Douglass, one of the 19th century's great orators and writers. At about the same time Douglass discovered it, Abraham Lincoln was absorbing its oratorical lessons from his own copy of the *Orator* in New Salem, Illinois, with a similar effect on his own powerful oratory. Horace Greeley, the famous newspaper editor who popularized (though not originated)  the slogan “Go West, young man, and grow up with the country,” wrote in his autobiography (1868) that ""The first book I ever owned was *The Columbian Orator*, given to me by my uncle Perry . . .  as I lay very sick of the measles . . .  when about four [!] years of age.” To be fair, he adds “This *Orator* was my prized text-book for years, and I became thoroughly familiar with its contents; though I cannot say that I ever learned much of value from it, — certainly not oratory.”

As historian David Blight, who edited and wrote the introduction to the bicentenary re-issue of the book, notes, the Bible, an occasional almanac, and the *Columbian Orator* were “the only books in many homesteads.” It became “one of the primers through which thousands of American youth improved their reading and practiced syntax and speaking.” 

For Blight’s introduction see its bicentennial edition (New York University Press, 1998), pp. xiii-xxix. A free [copy of the *Orator* is here](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Columbian_Orator/DfBDAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=the+columbian+orator&printsec=frontcover).

845,AskHistorians,"Due to the enormous size of Russia, are there any villages / areas, was there ever instances of people unaware they lived in Russia?","This is kind of a complex notion, because a Russian “state” existed before the idea of a “nation” did. So the assumptions made in this question are that there is a state which has absolute borders which is recognizably Russian in character, and that it’s possible for people within that recognized state to have no idea of the state which they are ostensibly part of. Basically, it assumes an Imperial framework. There are some people in Russia today who know about the Russian state but would probably reject the idea of belonging to said state, especially in more culturally diverse regions.


Given that caveat, and in the spirit of answering your question, though, we can kind of say yes! Russian claims during the age of Imperialism were extremely vast and based on the descriptions of explorers, much like claims in the New World by other Europeans. In fact, the United  States bought Alaska from Russia, but realistically the claims to Alaska were recognized only by European and White American powers, not by the natives living there. Actual functional control- or even communication- beyond a few forts along the water was much more difficult.


Even in “Russia proper,” though, there were difficulties. Though it’s an environmental history primarily, Bathsheba Demuth’s Floating Coast is an excellent glimpse into the difficulties of both the Russian monarchy and the Soviets in trying to establish a functional military and political hegemony over the Bering Strait and the people’s who live there. The Russian monarchy even had concerns that American merchants might accidentally acculturate the local people, making them more loyal to Americans than to the Russians, who they saw rarely beyond sparse fort/ trading posts. Even those locals who were familiar with the Russians or Americans had to be taught that they were part of the empire, and I’m sure there were people in remote regions who never saw or knew of the forts from whichever the Russians “ruled” the land in name."
846,AskHistorians,"When and why did the African-American community began referring to one another as ""nigga""?","""Nigga did not only describe the lives loathed; it also described the lives loved.""

- Yahdon Israel

From the context of Israel's article that is listed in the sources, ""nigga"" is a term that exists as a critique of the placement of black culture in broader society and discussion on the the self in that culture of oppression. There are obviously connotative differences between ""nigger"" and ""nigga."" The closeness of pronunciation is still enough difference between. You may have heard of someone saying the ""n-word"" and another person asking, ""with the hard r?"" 

In terms of its understand in the academic community, it may be best to start with a quick discussion of African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). It is also known as Ebonics. According to John Rickford on linguistic society.org, AAVE  grew out of African-American scholars desire to discuss Ebonics as a legitimate dialect of English instead as a derivative means of expression by an uneducated minority group.  AAVE did enjoy broader discussion until the Oakland School Board wrote a resolution that states that AAVE was the primary language of their African-American students. One of the consistent aspect of Ebonics is in pronunciation. In the case of ""nigga,"" the final consonant in omitted. So one could argue that ""nigga"" is essentially the same was ""nigger."" However, the use of connotative and contextual meaning of ""nigger"" and ""nigga"" are broadly different. People reacted differently when Michael Richards shouted ""He's a nigger!"" than when
Gangsta Rap performs the song. The fact that African-Americans have taken to using a term that has historically been used to deride, dehumanize, or demean them can be seen as a type of agency. ""Nigger"" and ""nigga"" are the same word but who speaks truly changed the connotative meaning.

Historically, in mainstream culture in America, people usually see the term first used consistently among comedians like Richard Pryor and Paul Mooney. In an interview with Keith Olberman, Mooney states that while performing himself and writing for Pryor, one of their motivations for including ""nigga"" in the comedy was to ""depower"" the word. Later in the interview, he stated that he had stopped using the word. During this interview, he also states he started using the word in comedy for about 32 years. This interview was in 2006 during the Michael Richards fiasco at the Laugh Factory. So in mainstream culture, the usage of ""nigga"" likely begins in the early 1970s and was politically and critically motivated.

The word itself exists in our cultural contexts and means different things to every single person. Tupac Shakur turned the word into an acronym with positive connotations, ""Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished."" The NAACP holds that the word in both its forms should not be used. It's meaning is truly diverse across racial boundaries.

The etymology of the two words come from Spanish ""negro."" It was broadly accepted to refer to African-Americans as Negros until the mid-20th century. One of Fredrick Douglas most famous writings ""The Meaning of July Fourth to the Negro"" confirms the usage of the term among free blacks during the late antebellum period.  W.E.B Dubois used both ""negro"" and ""black"" in his writing. So even going into the 20 early mid-20th century, the writings of educated African Americans do not use the word ""nigga,"" however that is to be expected. DuBois did have some writing about the meaning of ""nigger"" and other terms used to generalize the black community. He in fact preferred the word ""negro""as it is inaccurate. He states that African-Americans are indeed brown. So that is another aspect to consider. There may not have been slaves calling each other ""niggas"" but they were likely using some term to broadly categorize people. However, only relying on the primary sources written by educated black men betrays several other groups within the black community like women and the uneducated, these voices and perspectives are likely lost to us so we can only speculatively. Black people were definitely been using the term before Richard Pryor became popular in the mainstream. 

As I stated previously, through Ebonics ""nigga"" is ""nigger"" interpreted through another culture.  The two words are inexorably connected to one another in which the existence of one almost guarantees the existence of the other. I will conclude with a quote from Dubois.

""Your real work, my dear young man, does not lie with names. It is not a matter of changing them, losing them, or forgetting them. Names are nothing but little guideposts along the Way. The Way would be there and just as hard and just as long if there were no guideposts, but not quite as easily followed! Your real work as a Negro lies in two directions: First, to let the world know what there is fine and genuine about the Negro race. And secondly, to see that there is nothing about that race which is worth contempt; your contempt, my contempt; or the contempt of the wide, wide world.""

-W.E.B Dubois

847,AskHistorians,This might be an odd question for this sub but what was going on in the US in the late 50s/early 60s that one of the main themes of Twilight Zone was isolation and loneliness?,"The Twilight Zone is one of my favorite bits of media ever created and Rod Serling is one of my favorite American writers. To answer this question we have to look at three things: The post WW2 America, The Cold War and creator/writer Rod Serling.

I could take every piece of Serlings work and analyze the man (and Mods be dammed I'd love to do just that), but when looking at the historical reach of the Twilight Zone, it is impossible to make a assessment without assessing Serling himsef and the multitude of themes in his writing.

Rod Serling was the creative spark behind the Twilight Zone. On top of being the face of the show, the episodes he wrote [consistently rank among the most favored](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls066391301/), and it is not unfair to suggest that everything that made the show what it was is due in part to his influence. Serling, like many men in America in the late 50s and early 60's was a WW2 vet. He survived the pacific theater with a purple heart, four bronze stars, an arrowhead device, and in the 16 years between his enlisting, aged harder than a US President

Whether textual or subtextual, many protagonists were heavy drinkers, heavy smokers and people wrestling with private demons. Many of Serling's stories evoked nostalgia, featuring protagonists who pined for simpler times and/or simpler lives. [Walking Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_Distance), [A Stop at Willoughby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Stop_at_Willoughby), [Kick the Can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_the_Can) and [Back There](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_There) all deal with themes of nostalgia, changing the past, and the comforts of simplicity amid a decidedly uncomfortable life.

Other themes that the series would play with (a lot) were that of death. Death is constantly portrayed as something beautiful, tantalizing and oddly comfortable. It is a seductress in [Perchance to Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perchance_to_Dream_(The_Twilight_Zone)) and a kind, handsome, young man in [The Passersby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passersby).

Death is always beautiful. It is feared by the living and multiple times over the moral is that death should be accepted.

The point is, while you talk about isolation, isolation was not the only motif in The Twilight Zone that resonated with audiences.

This isn't to suggest Rod Serling lived his life with one foot in the macabre. His daughter describes him as "" [a very positive, fun, down to earth person](https://www.seniorvoicealaska.com/story/2013/12/01/columns/rod-serlings-personal-zone-was-not-at-all-like-his-show/315.html).""But, at the same time, I think it behooves us to consider how much Serling was pulling from personal demons when he wrote characters wrestling with personal demons and, to get to the meat of your question, why this resonated with so many Americans in the late 50s and early 60s.

The dark underbelly of 1950's suburbia has become an assumed truth of fiction. Countless stories set in the 1950's and 60's juxtapose the conservative conformity with modern reprobates like racism, homophobia, drug use, spousal abuse and PTSD; all of which certainly existed in this time frame, and without public acceptability, but it's arrogant of our cohort to assume every one of these sins was under the surface of every home as we ""correct"" the facade with our openness to these problems. I bring this up, because there is a trend to recontextualize this time period for what we think it's problems were from our heuristic, and not where the people, at the time, would actually find anxiety.

It is pop-scholarly to cite that horror stories are reflective of the anxieties of their time. From stated metaphors like Romero's Night of the Living Dead, to meta farces like Wheedon's Cabin in the Woods, it is generally agreed that successful horror movies are successful because they tap into something cultural at the time (though still debated (I have a great video on this subject for the movie Halloween, but the source is not scholarly and I'd rather not risk things with the mods more than I have already, but PM if you're interested)). With that in mind, I would like to highlight that, if not self evident, The Twilight Zone *is* a horror series that frames itself in fantasy and science fiction.

A lot of the social commentary found in The Twilight Zone was not original to The Twilight Zone. Years before the Monsters were due on [Maple Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monsters_Are_Due_on_Maple_Street) the paranoia of enemies within was criticized by, *Invasion of the Body Snatchers* where even our friends could be enemies. Several of the Twilight Zone's best stories were screen adaptations of stories written by other authors, including, but not limited to, [Time Enough at Last](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Enough_at_Last),  [I Shot an Arrow into the Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Shot_an_Arrow_into_the_Air),  [Four O'Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_O%27Clock) (all stories that deal with grown men in the throngs of alienation). In a lot of ways they *are* stock stories. Many classic Twilight Zone tails have been retold without reference or allusion and many more have been parodied as cliche, but what made these stories so resonant (as I see it) was that, in the post WW2 world, conventionally existential anxieties were made tangible.

In the 1950's America's reconstruction from the Second World War was psychological compared to the rest of the worlds very physical reconstruction. The land was unscathed, but the people had seen firsthand what war meant, and this says nothing of The Bomb. For many Americans the question of when the horrors of war would come to American soil was not a question of if, but when, and would they be able to confront it when it did. America was at the center of the world stage, and every American now fit into an economy infinitely more complex than the pre-war isolationism allowed for.

With the burden of being a part of a super power, nostalgia leaned far more halcyon than what we would see in later decades and The Twilight Zone challenged this. With many World War II vets carrying scars from the war at a time it wasn't talked about The Twilight Zone told stories of dead soldiers cursed to relive the horrors of war in endless loops (I know I decried our tendency to project PTSD into this time period earlier, but you don't need a BA in English to see how stories like  [Deaths-Head Revisited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths-Head_Revisited), [The Arrival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arrival_(The_Twilight_Zone)) and especially [A Quality of Mercy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quality_of_Mercy), were written for a nation with memories of the war). Finally, with the uncertainty of a nuclear future and threats all around stories where death was neither friend, nor foe, but friendlier than our fears would manifest helped mollify an ambiguous threat that somehow seemed more ready than ever before.

* [Medieval literature treats adultery as common and not especially a bad thing. Does this actually reflect the incidence and social treatment of adultery in medieval England?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4c964m/medival_english_literature_such_as_the_canterbury/d1gss5l/)

~~

The wild sexcapades and bridled courtly passion of medieval popular literature seem to come from a different world than the early medieval [Church penitential handbooks](http://i.imgur.com/IHfLPL2.png). Or perhaps you prefer 13C theologian Thomas Aquinas [writing](http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3154.htm#article8) that adultery represents a *special deformity* of lust. But between fantasy and prescription (or one might say: between writers' fantasy and the Church's fantasy), there's a lot of room for negotiation and change over time.

Medieval western Europe inherits Roman and biblical legal traditions that place marriage in the realm of property law. Property meaning inheritance by legitimate offspring, but property also in the sense that wives were the property of their husbands. These principles governed the understanding of adultery as based on the marital status of the woman involved. It was a problem  any time a married woman slept with a man besides her husband, because it would throw the parentage of any children into doubt. It was also a problem when any non-husband slept with a married woman, because he was violating the husband’s property rights. Under late antique law like the Lex iulia (especially in its post-Christianity incarnations!), the penalty for adultery could range up to death.

You’ll notice that one category is exempt: married men could sleep with unmarried women without a formal charge of adultery getting in the way. This tradition would endure solidly into the early Middle Ages and still cling on tenaciously even later. For example, female concubines of elite men were an accepted, even expected part of court life in early medieval Italy. Legally and conceptually, they did not see this as adultery.

But an increasing force in the Middle Ages disagreed: the Church. The discomfort with the “worldly” pleasure of sex combined with its unfortunate necessity for procreation led to the Augustinian tradition that sex was licit *only* for reproduction and *only* within the confines of monogamous marriage. This represented a theoretical gender equalization in the determination of adultery, although in practice, men with power continued to flaunt what they could.

As the Church moved to increase its power (spiritual, political economic) within and over medieval society from the years around 1000 onward, sex and marriage—and sex and marriage *law*--became a key pillar of this control. Adultery was both a sin and a crime, subject to religious penance as well as social sanction. The Middle Ages developed two distinct legal systems, canon (Church) and secular. Adultery could actually land the accused in either court! 

What constituted adultery? Well, the legal boundaries were well established: any sex that broke a marital bond. Even if the other spouse approved it: the wife would be charged as an adultress, and the husband for the separate crime of procuration or pimping (this is how the Latin legal texts are gendered), sorry, Mr. James Reynolds. In practice, adultery generally amounted to “sex beyond marriage that other people labeled adultery,” as unsatisfying as that is. 

But while lords and kings continued to achieve quite the reputations for sleeping around, the Church’s hold on popular views of sex and marriage was increasingly strong. This power coincided with a growing emphasis on public order throughout society. While the internal disease of sin still mattered, the external social ramifications thereof were an increasing focus of concern. Additionally, in the 14-15C the nuclear family, with marriage at its heart, was more and more the fundamental economic unit of late medieval society. These developments combined to make adultery either the most or second most common sexual crime of the late Middle Ages! Adultery was both common *and* an increasing concern for people, laity and clergy alike.

**The King Arthur Part**

Medieval popular literature, and especially the Arthurian tradition, reflects the changing mores surrounding the need to prosecute adultery. Although the story of King Arthur himself seems to predate the 12th century, Arthurian *romance* with the attendant Knights of the Round Table and their paramours is a creation of the later 12C. Writers after that are indebted to the earlier, since it’s what their audiences know and expect. So different authors’ treatment of adultery is quite revealing—especially when it comes to the trio of Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot.

Lancelot becomes a starring figure in Arthur’s court in *The Knight of the Cart* by the author we call Chretien de Troyes. His love affair with Guinevere is both treason against his king and adultery, and the text even acknowledges the folly of adultery by having Lancelot defend Guinevere’s honor when she is accused of the crime (with another knight). This 12C portrayal of Lancelot is actually somewhat ambivalent on the thoroughness of his heroism.

In the 13C, a text called the Prose *Lancelot* shows how Lancelot in all his adulterous glory had become entrenched as a true hero in medieval readers’ minds. But when a probable-monk author got his hands on the Prose *Lancelot*, he wrote a sequel, *Quest for the Holy Grail*. In this, nobody brings out their dead and Lancelot actually *does penance* for his affair. 

Scholars typically see this text as a direct attempt to counter a popular interpretation that deviated from social norms. And why would it not? 

To use a modern parallel, the Arthur tradition is one of the Middle Ages’ greatest fanfiction products. What percentage of modern fanfic is shipfic? The characters an author wants to see together, they can finally *put* together in their own writing. The unconsummatable becomes consummated in later fiction, where it would not be present in the formal, official storyline.

The fraught emotions surrounding people's interpretations of love, marriage, honor, and social order combined with an increasingly rigid attitude towards Church teaching are well displayed by the 14th century master, Dante Alighieri. Awesomely, Dante even points to the troublesome role of romance literature within society! Few readers of *Inferno* come away without some sympathy for Francesca da Rimini, damned to the outermost circle of Hell's punishments for lust=>adultery. Her murder at the hands of her husband before she had the chance to repent seems unfair, a damnation that did not have to be. 

Another Italian author Boccaccio upped the pathos of this story, inserting into the literary tradition a *backstory* which has Francesca *tricked into a horrid marriage*, presenting readers with an additional layer of tragedy. 

And directly to our point here: Dante himself takes the additional step of having Francesca read the story of Lancelot as she falls into into her adulterous love! Ultimately, the *Inferno* must damn her for adultery, however sympathetic her plight may be...while slyly pointing out the double standard of popular romance literature.

By the time Malory is writing in the 15th century, however, concern over the social tearing of adultery, prostitution, sodomy is rising. He has 250 years of sprawling Arthuriana to squish into one text. The “facts” of the knights, including Tristam and Lancelot, are well known—this would include the adulterous affairs. 

When it comes to less significant knights, Malory actually works to justify their adultery in light of honor and social order. Thus Gawain may kidnap a “knight’s lady” while he sleeps. But his heroic deed is slaying the man who slept with his (widowed) mother, since Lamorak is the son of the man who made her a widow. The death restores his family honor violated by an affair that is fornication, not adultery. By his benchmarks, Gawain remains the chivalric hero.

With Tristam and Isolde, Malory makes a crucial change to earlier tradition. The two consummate their love only after King Mark proves treacherous. Once Mark has removed himself from the plane of honor so totally, there is no honor to be violated by the love affair. Malory writes out a *whole* lot of “Isoldam” sex from the French tradition. In order to justify adultery to his 15C audience, Malory had to paint Mark’s actions as a *worse* violation of right order than adultery, in large part by cleaning up the actions of the wayward lovers.

The royal trio, however, shows most of all the increasing discomfort with adultery even in literature. Since Arthur is the faithful Christian king par excellence, Malory can’t exactly take the King Mark solution. Instead, he works from the other side. Lancelot’s presence in the Tristam section is also very carefully sanitized compared to earlier tradition: references to the physical adultery are scrubbed out. Lancelot sleeps with the unmarried *Elaine*, not actually Guinevere. Whenever it comes time to actually broach the question of physical passion between the storied couple directly, Malory hedges:

> As the French book says, the queen and Sir Lancelot were together. And whether they were abed or otherwise, I must make no mention, for love at that time was not as love is nowdays.

Ultimately, that is where the 15th century laid their justification: love at at that time was not as love is nowadays. Acceptance of adultery in fiction did necessarily mean acceptance of adultery in reality.

849,AskHistorians,"In the 18th century, Edo had a population of 1,000,000 - the largest city in the world. How was this population sustained in pre-industrial Japan? What was life like for the poor? The rich?","I don't have the resources to answer most of your questions right now, but I can offer a beginning.

The thing you have to understand is that one very specific historical circumstance led to Edo's massive growth: the ""alternating attendance system"" (*sankin kotai*) enacted by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Basically, as a means of exerting social and economic control over the dozens of (often quite restive) feudal lords (*daimyo*) that constituted Japan's political structure - lords who I might add were in no way ideologically bound to the shogunate, a military dynasty with none of the ""divine right of kings"" stuff going on in Europe - the Tokugawas from the mid-17th century required them to spend alternating years in their capitol, Edo. And by ""them"" I mean the lords and like half of their massive retinues; their families were often forced to stay in Edo permanently, as basically hostages. Now as you can imagine, the costs of housing and feeding thousands of your dudes (to say nothing of moving them across country, *by foot*, once a year) were exorbitant, and that was the whole point of the law - to keep the daimyo from amassing enough money to become economic (thus potentially military) rivals. But on the flip side of the coin, all that money was being spent on goods and services, which means that Edo was the place to be if you were a merchant, or a craftsman, or a prostitute, etc., and wanted to get rich or at least make enough to live what we might roughly analogize to a middle-class existence, although it would have been a lot poorer than what we probably think of when we think of the middle class.

On the question of space, I'll just say that the Kanto Plain where Edo was/Tokyo is is vast, with lots of space to spread out. If you look at a map of Tokyo today, you might be amazed to know that many of the locations we (at least foreigners) think of as ""central Tokyo,"" like Shinjuku or Shibuya, were in fact basically countryside as recently as a hundred years ago. Of course that's not to say that there weren't slums, and that they weren't overcrowded and filthy like slums usually are.

I'm going to stop there, but let me recommend some readings. Edward Seidensticker's *Low City, High City* is a bit dated now but still essential reading for the history of the city. On the question of welfare, check out the ""Evolution of Japanese-style Welfare"" chapter in Sheldon Garon's *Molding Japanese Minds.* 

Also if you're interested in a 20th century interpretation of what daily life was like in the Edo period, I can't recommend the films of Yamanaka Sadao highly enough. You can find his three best surviving with subtitles [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B_bP9ViNrU), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iUy9j-MK6w), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwH6Tun3cSM)."
850,AskHistorians,Marie Curie named the element Polonium at a time when Poland was not an independent country. Was this a radical political statement? How was the naming of Polonium received by the international community?,"That's a very interesting question! And, indeed, one would expect some reservations, at least by the countries that had occupied Poland at the time (Russia, Prussia, Austria). But, interestingly enough, there seem to be none. You'll find many assertions, that Marie Curie proposed the name exactly to bring attention to the lost independence of her home country [eg. [here](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S092058611200209X/1-s2.0-S092058611200209X-main.pdf?_tid=26561cd2-3478-11e6-b2f5-00000aacb360&acdnat=1466160312_8b718455fd7d52061033b3d67aaf3594), p. 2.], a statment that probably goes back to [Eve Curie's biography of her mother](https://books.google.de/books?id=3rd8CgAAQBAJ&pg=PT163&dq=madame+curie+could+we+call+it+polonium&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjwszP867NAhUJVxQKHZKSAYMQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=madame%20curie%20could%20we%20call%20it%20polonium&f=false). Even though this book is debatable by historic standards, this is a more than reasonable assumption, regarding the fact that the Curies explained the element's name themselves as given in honour of the home country of one of them (the english translation of this excerpt of the original article is given by Eve as well, on the same page). Nevertheless, there seem to be no negative reactions to the name.

The only controversy about the name seems to have arisen, when the German chemist Marckwald discovered a radioactive elment and named it radiotellurium at a point, when Curie had not been able to isloate Polonium itself as yet.  Curie quickly  suspected that both elements were identical [Cf. e.g. [Otto Hahn Memories] (https://books.google.de/books?id=BAcAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=otto+hahn+controversy+polonium&source=bl&ots=iO5iadvwz9&sig=l-G5LiryQKbaoe164ykkbBK-zaM&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiX0Lux7a7NAhUCOBQKHXZBA1QQ6AEISzAF#v=onepage&q=otto%20hahn%20controversy%20polonium&f=false), p.22.], resulting in a longer scientific discourse  [cf. e.g. an [article by Rutherford that addresses this question] (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786440409463234?journalCode=tphm17#aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YW5kZm9ubGluZS5jb20vZG9pL3BkZi8xMC4xMDgwLzE0Nzg2NDQwNDA5NDYzMjM0QEBAMA==) or this short notice in [Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v73/n1901/abs/073549b0.html) from 1906, in which an article, published by Curie in Physikalische Zeitschrift (1905), 6, is mentioned, in which she provided proof for her suspicion that the elements are identical]. Even though, some scientists considered the name radiotellurium to be better than Polonium (cf. the Hahn article mentioned above), there is no indication that this had anything to do with the political implications, rather they felt radiotellurium was describing the element (or rather his chemical properties) better.

Edit: Fixed some mistakes I made."
851,AskHistorians,Did the 1918 epidemic move geopolitics to the Left?,"Not exactly. There's a better argument that the 1918 pandemic was a serious but short-lived and largely forgotten episode in the progressive era and failed to turn the tide against a rising right-wing correction.

The flu pandemic did not occur in a vacuum, as the Great War kept raging through Europe. The flu was unusually lethal for some reason (perhaps cytokine storms or aspirin poisoning) and swept through populations of soldiers and civilians swiftly, though it largely subsided after the deadly second wave in autumn 1918. One theory is the pandemic was ""forgotten"" quickly because various outbreaks of diseases like cholera, diphtheria, typhoid, and yellow fever also spread during the early 20th century, as well as the fact that Western media (except for neutral Spain) largely suppressed information about the Spanish flu for wartime propaganda purposes. Another theory is a sort of ""collective PTSD"" that pushed survivors to avoid discussing the experience, akin to the shell shock of many veterans.

But perhaps the most important fact is the 1918 pandemic coincided with the end of WWI and was thus overshadowed domestically by much of the geopolitical peace negotiations. US President Woodrow Wilson embarked on a nationwide tour to boost support for his League of Nations idea, but the Senate ultimately rejected the treaty, and he served out the term as a sickly lame duck. Thus the 1920 election became a referendum on foreign policy and isolationism, the so-called ""return to normalcy."" Republican candidate Warren Harding defeated Democratic nominee James Cox in a landslide. The American people seemed weary of international obligations and chose Harding's message of ""America First,"" signaling a return to control of the US by American institutions or national sovereignty.

Of course, in the US, unlike Russia and parts of Western Europe, the 1918 flu influenced public health by spurring reforms in data aggregation and employer-based health insurance plans, as well as the rise of epidemiology as a study. But for various social and political reasons, the specter of the pandemic seemed to not be memorable or powerful enough to overcome a general conservative backlash in the 1920s, sparked by foreign policy sentiments, that precluded proposals like nationalization of insurance firms or universal healthcare coverage.

852,AskHistorians,"A number of modern Muslim majority countries have laws that restrict the sale/production of alcohol. However, wine features heavily in medieval Islamic poetry - none of the historical Islamic kingdoms seems to have cracked down on it. Were there any attempts at prohibition prior to the modern era?","How does that expression go...""The only thing medieval Muslims liked more than complaining about people drinking wine, was drinking wine""?^1 The writers fuming about street parties in thirteenth-century Cairo would certainly have agreed.

The Fatimid caliph al-Hakim (985-1021) gave total prohibition a try. But when he ""vanished"" (as it were) in 1021, his sister Sitt al-Mulk took over. One of the first things she did was re-legalize wine.

There's more to the story than that, obviously. Al-Hakim's ban on alcohol was just one part of a series of what he saw as religiously motivated reforms. He banned music in public, and he sharply oppressed Egypt's Jewish and Coptic Christian populations. Al-Hakim had gradually developed a hard-line interpretation of his religion over the course of his rule, under the influence of his adviser Bardawan. Then a religious movement decided he was semi-divine, and he may or may not have believed them.

But even during al-Hakim's attempted prohibition, local governors in places like Damascus were permitting the sale and purchase of wine anyway.

Sitt al-Mulk's reforms of al-Hakim's reforms, too, were much more in depth. She restored a lot of seized property to Jewish and Christian Egyptians, for example, and stamped out the prohibitions on public performance of music, women in public, and so forth.

She also probably ordered the assassination of the Damascus governor who had always allowed wine, so there is that.

The other infamous example of (attempted) alcohol prohibition in the medieval Islamic world is the Almohad dynasty in high medieval North Africa and al-Andalus (Iberia). Ibn Tumart, sort of the father of the Almohad movement, was dead-set against wine. Later tradition is filled with anecdotes (true or not) of him, personally, overturning wine barrels or smacking people with his staff.

As Allen Fromherz translates it, there's even one anecdote in which he yells at a group of enslaved men for drinking. They snap back at him, ""Who made you the morality police?"" Ibn Tumart stares them down and declares, ""God and his Prophet.""

As with al-Hakim, but without the claims of semi-divinity and with a much longer implementation, the Almohad crackdown on wine was accompanied by a lot of other harsher moral measures and oppression of Jews and Christians. (Didn't stop the Almohads from hiring mercenaries of any and all religions. But, you know, the rest of 'em.)

In general, though, the thing to remember about alcohol prohibition in the medieval Islamic world is--Muslims weren't the only people there. Sure, sometimes Muslims themselves were not allowed to purchase/sell wine to each other, either by law or by peer pressure.

But there were Greek Christians, and there were Latin merchants, and there were travelers to bribe as go-betweens. And European Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem, for their part, drank a WHOLE lot of wine.

~~

I should add that the use of wine and drunkenness in Islamic religious poetry, as a *trope*, should be taken as allegory rather than Tales from a Madrasa Dorm. The struggle to put the, let's call it the experience of God, into words isn't unique to a single religion or era. Christian writers from late antiquity onwards have used what some people interpret as erotic (and others as baldly sexual) allegories to describe encountering God--including (presumably) lifelong-celibate authors.

I have a brief answer on [medieval women writers and bridal mysticism](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3q0rkm/panel_ama_devils_ghosts_heretics_witches_miracles/cwb8dla/), if you're interested in exploring that idea further.

853,AskHistorians,Why do antique dolls often look so creepy? Did people not experience the uncanny valley in the past?,"Well, Ernst Jentsch published *Zur Psychologie des Unheimlichen* in 1906 and Sigmund Freud's *Das Unheimliche* is 1919, and both of them turn to simulacra of human beings as components of their respective understandings of ""the uncanny."" So while Uncanny Valley itself is a recent coinage, we can rule out the general *concept* as a modern-day invention. (Whatever its proven or unproven actual psychological underpinnings).

However, neither Jentsch nor Freud is talking specifically about dolls in the sense of Bratz or Cabbage Patch Kids. In fact, Jentsch specifically asserts that ""A doll which closes and opens its eyes by itself, or a small automatic toy, will cause no notable sensation of [the uncanny]."" *(trans. Roy Sellars; [PDF](http://www.art3idea.psu.edu/locus/Jentsch_uncanny.pdf))*. Instead, what he (and to a lesser extent Freud, who simply stipulates Jentsch's point here) circles as the uncanny in terms of mock-humans is automata--that is, ""the life-size machines that perform complicated tasks, blow trumpets, dance and so forth."" 

For Jentsch, the uncanny lies in the question of whether something/someone is human or a machine. Critically, this can go in either direction--he identifies the jerking, unconscious movements of a person having a tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure as triggering the sensation of the uncanny in the same way. But his exemplar par excellence, also picked up by Freud, is E.T.A. Hoffmann's short story [*Der Sandmann.*](https://bit.ly/2JNuuoU)

From the beginning, in the protagonist's recounting of his childhood nightmare/fever dream/vision/reality, the story blurs the line between human and doll-automaton. Creeptastic Coppelius, the reified ""Sandman"" of Nathanael's childhood terror, seizes the boy in his father's room and treats him like an automaton:

> ""We will examine the mechanism (*Mechanismus*) of his hands and feet.""

> And then he seized me so roughly that my joints cracked, and screwed off my hands and feet, afterwards putting them back again, one after the other. ""There's something wrong here,"" he mumbled. ""But now it's as good as ever.""

Fast-forwarding in time, Nathanael is engaged to a (genuinely lovely) woman named Clara. However, through the lens of a telescope, he becomes obsessed with another woman named Olimpia--the lens of the telescope being, in a way, artificial/mechanical eyes. Of course the drama of the story is that beautiful, dancing Olimpia, who always responds, ""Ah, ah!"" is actually an automaton.

And in the story's finale, when Nathanael and Clara have been reconciled, they go sightseeing one day, observing the land around them from a tower. Clara spots an apparently triffid, and Nathanael wants to take a closer look:

> Nathaniel mechanically put his hand into his breast pocket--he found Coppola's telescope, and pointed it to one side.

But before he sees the seemingly-walking shrub, he spots Clara. And his mind flashes back to dancing Olimpia, always through the telescope lens:

> He shrieked out in a piercing tone, ""Spin round, wooden doll! Spin round!"" Then seizing Clara with immense force, he tried to hurl her down, but with the desperate strength of one battling against death she clutched the railings.

Clara survives! But in his madness over the confusion of living and doll, Nathanael hurtles himself off the steeple. Throughout the story, then, the boundary between human and machine is repeatedly blurred, right into insanity and death.

(Freud thinks the real issue in Hoffmann's story is that eyes are a penis and women don't real, but...you know, *Freud*.)

Scholars of Gothic literature in particular have traced this theme of automata as the creepy uncanny, in an age where they were meant first of all to be a wondrous scientific and mechanical achievement, back to the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment. The idea of the human body as mechanism or machine (an automaton animated by the soul, if you want to be Cartesian about it) runs strongly through the writing of philosophers like La Mettrie. As Hoffmann's story shows, the idea could be inspiring to some, fearsome to others, and most importantly, *both at once*.

The theme of human/machine as horror is so prominent in 18th and 19th century Romantic and Gothic literature that Terry Castle even called her anthology of ""greatest hits"" academic articles *The Female Thermometer and the Eighteenth-Century Invention of the Uncanny.* 

...Of course, Castle is not a medievalist. And just as the medieval Near East, Byzantium, and (somewhat later) western Europe had both literary and practical traditions of awe-inspiring automata, the era's literature reveals a sense of the uncanny surrounding them.

However, as (AskHistorians AMA alumna!) E.R. Truitt points out, the creepy sensation for medieval authors wasn't a question of human and/versus machine. Instead, it was the twilight between life and death. Automata guard tombs, including ones meant to be a direct replication of the deceased; they guard castles populated by spectres. In some stories, automata resembling dead people are employed as a purposeful fraud to pretend the person is still alive.

So the overall point is: what is uncanny to the people of one era might not be to those of another, or it might be equally uncanny but for different reasons.

As to why some people today find antique dolls creepy, I was unable to find any solid research beyond the usual ""dolls in horror movies"" (fun fact: in the 19th century, it's more often the puppet *masters* who are the bad guys) as well as some info that suggests the phenomenon isn't limited to antique dolls. But this will be quite interesting in light of the above, I think:

In Francis McAndrew and Sara Koehnke's study ""On the Nature of Creepiness,"" ([PDF](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/McAndrew-Koehnke-2016.pdf)) their respondents rated ""collecting something"" as the creepiest hobby--provided that something was ""*dolls*, insects, reptiles, or body parts such as teeth, bones, or fingernails."" McAndrew and Koehnke identify, overall, creepiness as the sensation of ambiguity over whether something is or isn't a threat. The things that people find creepy to collect are, they point out, either things that humans have an instinctive fear of--snakes and spiders--or things that relate to the living/dead boundary--pulled teeth, clipped fingernails, or outright bones.

Or dolls.

Our sense of the uncanny, it seems, has more traces of the medieval than one might expect from this side of industrialization and the microchip.

854,AskHistorians,How common are war memorials for the LOSING side?,"In India, we do have memorials, museums and statues for the INA (Indian National Army) which fought on the Axis side during World War 2. It was an armed force created by Indian nationalists in 1942 in Southeast Asia. Its purpose was to secure Indian independence from British rule with Japan's support. 

After Japan lost the war, the British Indian army decided to court martial a number of INA officers. They hoped that by exposing the reported stories of torture and collaboration, they could turn the public opinion against the INA. 

The first and most widely known court martial was that of Prem Sahgal, Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan. The three accused men belonged to the three major religions of India: Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. Indians felt that the INA represented a secular national army when judged against the British-Indian Army, where caste and religious differences were preserved amongst ranks. In a matter of weeks, the INA officers were acclaimed heroes who fought for the freedom of India. The two major political parties in India, the Indian National Congress, which was majority Hindu but officially secular, and the Indian Muslim League found common cause in supporting the defendants. 

In spite of the popular support, the three officers were sentenced to deportation for life. But the immense public pressure, demonstrations and riots forced the British to release all three defendants. Within three months, 11,000 soldiers of the INA were also released although barred from joining the newly created Indian Armed Forces.

In India, the INA continues to be a popular and widely celebrated organisation. There are several museums dedicated to it which display the uniforms worn by the soldiers, post stamps released by the INA during WW2, photographical material, etc.  There is also a memorial in Singapore dedicated to the INA. The INA's battle cry, Jai Hind (glory to India), remains a popular nationalist greeting. It has been used by all Indian Prime Ministers to conclude their Independence day speeches. Every aspect of the INA has also been the subject of a vast collection of literature, music and visual art. There are numerous movies, television shows and documentaries which have been made on it, and in many languages."
855,AskHistorians,"In Ken Burn's The War, an American WWII Veteran recounts a story of how a captured German POW was very knowledgeable of his small city in Connecticut because before he went to the front, he was ""in training for the administration of the territories"". What do we know about Nazi plans for America?","In simplest terms, Nazi plans for the United States were fairly ill-formed. I would begin by referring back to [this previous answer of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/bdtst2/why_did_hitler_so_readily_dismiss_the_united/el1liqo/) which covers a lot of ground here, but the main takeaway should be that conflict with the United States before the war remained something that was to happen in the indefinite future, and although this shifted by 1941, real plans for how to attack America, let alone what to do with it *afterwards*, still were not a priority. Practical concerns had been bandied about since the '30s, but never reached the point of any concrete discussions about imminent conflict, and what planning existed was pushed back with outbreak of war in '39.

As I touch on there, there was obviously an awareness of just how *hard* reaching America could be, and taking the war to American shores required a strong, deep-water navy as well as air power capable of making it that far, all of which were a part of development of naval and air assets in the '30s. Some of this fed into the insane idea that Hitler had once held of Britain siding with Germany - and thus the Royal Navy bolstering such needs, something which he continued to harbor against all odds. In any case, Japan did change the calculus to a degree, insofar as it provides more naval power to split American attention, but it didn't add all that much.  

In mid-1941, Hitler provided what Herwig describes as the ""clearest definition to date of his ultimate plans concerning the United States"", but I would say that they are more illustrative of how vague they remained at that point. Coming from a discussion between Raeder and Hitler, the Naval War Staff diary recorded:

>America is pressing with its new imperialist spirit sometimes into the European, sometimes into the Asian *Lebensraum*. Regarded from our point of view, Russia threatens int he East, America in the West; from Japan's point of view, int he West Russia, in the East America. Therefore he [Hitler] is of the opinion that we must jointly annihilate them. There are tasks in the lives of people that are hard. One cannot solve these tasks by closing one's self to them or by abandoning them until a future time. [...] The Russian war has been won. If one must fight against the United States, then this should also occur under his [Hitler] leadership. He finds the idea of postponing something that can be accomplished now cowardly. Every generation has the duty of relieving its children of that which can be done now.

Again, it is fairly telling. Although the potential of how to wage war with America had been disused prior of course, in '39-'40 it had mostly focused on reaction to American entry rather than German provocation - such as the need to act quickly to prevent capture of the Azores. Only *now*, in July of '41, is planning seriously shifting to the potential of actual war with the United States in the imminent future, and at that it remains quite vague, with Hitler vacillating back and forth about how immediate it might need to be. Hitler's unfounded notion of British willingness to not only make peace, but enter the German sphere, continued to play a part here, in August of '41 opining that:

>I will not live to see it, but I am happy for the German Volk that it will one day witness how Germany and England united will line up against America. Germany and England will know what one has to expect from the other. And we will then have found the proper ally.

As you can see, this also is a step back from the bellicosity of July. Although America's entry into the war in December ensured that Britain would not be seeking peace, although as noted, this was seen as a *positive*, since Japan's navy would serve essentially the same purpose. And of course, Hitler *still* remained dissuaded, opining in '42 that:

>one day England will be obliged to make approaches to the Continent. And it will be a German-British army that will chase the Americans from Iceland. I don’t see much future for the Americans. In my view, it’s a decayed country.

Still though, war did mean better plans were required at this point, but again, the plans being constructed were much more basic, about how to even strike at America in the first place. In Spring of 1942, the Luftwaffe's ""Tasks for Long-Range Planes"" proposed the construction of long range bombers, either upgraded FW200s or else the ME-264, which never entered production, being based on the French coast in Brest, or alternatively the Azores, and supposedly penetrating as far as Indiana. Nothing ever materialized, and when he wasn't dreaming about an alliance with Britain, Hitler too was more reasonable in his estimations, such as the remarks he made to the Japanese ambassador in early 1942 that ""How one defeats the USA, he does not know yet"". The core considerations were practical, and forever remained hard to surmount, and an awareness that even once war had begun, it was a ways off.

Beyond these vague plans though, what more was there? Very little. There is [this famous map](https://imgur.com/kYVBurX) which speaks to the division of *South* America, but it had little basis in reality, despite Roosevelt's reference to it in an October, '41 speech. A forgery of British intelligence, it was at best based on vague information from Nazi agents in South America, but certainly not a German product. It should be telling that James P. Duffy's book *Target America: Hitler's Plan to Attack the United States* doesn't even seem to cover this, not having read it myself, but based on the index only spins out the above, and discusses espionage and such in Latin America, without anything about actual plans for *occupation*. 

So what is this all to say? 

Essentially that we know quite little about German plans, or rather we know that there is very little to know. The practical concerns about how even to take the fight to the shores of America were never laid out in considerable detail, and contrary to the impression the Ken Burns documentary may give, there is nothing to indicate that Germany had some administrative apparatus prepared and ready to go for the mass occupation of the United States either. If anything it is more of a reflection of American fears, however unfounded, about the potential reach of the German threat, than the reality of it. We can only speculate about the truth behind the anecdote, be it a misunderstanding, or an outright false memory, but it certainly doesn't reflect the degree of preparation that German had undertaken in reality.

856,AskHistorians,"It's often said that the jester is the only one that can speak truth to the king. Historically speaking though, has that ever been the case, using comedy or satire to persuade or inform an absolute monarchy or similar form of authority?","The history of court jesters is a bit jumbled, not least because their functions varied between different eras and societies, but also because what little source material we have mostly consists of anecdotes and witticisms that a given court's various public and private chroniclers saw fit to write down. Many anecdotes do involve ""speaking truth to power,"" but usually moderated by the jester's ongoing attempt to remain both useful to the monarch on the one hand, and alive and employed on the other. Sometimes this attempt fails spectacularly, as when Archy Archibald, jester to James I of England and by all accounts not very good at his job, told him that he thought the Prince of Wales was more popular with the common people; the ensuing father-son quarrel resulted in Archy being ""tossed in a blanket 'like a dog'"" by the Prince and his friends. (Archy was later fired by James' successor, Charles I, for accidentally revealing sensitive political information in one of his offhand remarks.)

In general, court jesters provided many benefits to their monarchs. A monarch with a court jester might be more likely to be perceived as close to the common people (due to the people's enjoyment of comedy), wealthy and powerful (due to the luxury of having a jester at all, and the jester's ability to skewer nobles or the church or anyone else while under the monarch's protection), and also magnanimous and forgiving (if the jester was able to poke at least mild fun at the monarch without having to fear execution or banishment). Having a jester also contributed to at least the perception that a ruler was not surrounded by yes-men; Elizabeth I allegedly rebuked one of her fools for being insufficiently severe with her.

But did they ever actually serve as advisors, dispensing pearls of wisdom from an unexpected quarter? Regarding your actual question, it sounds like you're specifically looking for stories where two things are true: 1) the jester is ""speaking truth to power,"" and 2) the monarch learns about or changes their mind about something important. There are plenty of examples where one or the other is true, but after doing a bit of digging, I haven't yet been able to find a clear example where both are true.

There are many anecdotal examples of jesters successfully convincing a monarch to hire or reward them, and/or not to punish them, on the basis of pure comedy. Here are two from *Fools Are Everywhere: The Court Jester Around the World* by Beatrice K. Otto:

>Tenali Rama, one of the three superstar jesters of India, is said to have earned his position as jester by making King Krsnadevaraya laugh. According to one story, he contrived for the king's guru to carry him around on his shoulders within sight of the king. Outraged at the humiliation of his holy man, the king sent some guards out to beat the man riding on the guru's shoulders. Tenali Rama, smelling impending danger, jumped down and begged forgiveness of the guru, insisting that to make amends he should carry him on his own shoulders. The guru agreed, and when the guards arrived the guru was duly beaten. The king found the trick amusing enough to appoint Tenali Rama his jester.

...

>On one occasion [Emperor Zhuangzong of China] was fooling around with a group of entertainers, and ""looking all around him he said, 'Son of Heaven Li! Where's Son of Heaven Li?'—referring to himself. [His jester] Newly Polished Mirror rushed forward and slapped him across the face. Zhaungzong turned ashen, and the courtiers were all terrified. The crowd of entertainers, also panic-stricken, seized the jester and asked, 'Just what d'you think you're playing at, slapping the Son of Heaven in the face?' Newly Polished Mirror, feigning innocence, explained, 'But there is only one Son of Heaven Li, so who was asking for him?' Thereupon the courtiers all laughed. Zhuangzong was delighted and rewarded Newly Polished generously.""

There are also many examples where jesters are alleged to have spoken truth (of a political nature) to power in a fairly surprising or shocking way, but not necessarily effecting any change in their monarch. In some particularly bold cases, I would wonder if these were popular jokes that were attributed to brazen jesters, but never actually spoken by them. Here's one from from the 19th-century *History of Court Fools*, by John Doran, about Charles the Bold's jester, Le Glorieux:
>Le Glorieux was a facetious fellow, and as fearless as facetious. His master, Duke Charles, used to compare himself with Hannibal. After the overthrow at Granson, Duke and fool were galloping in search of safety, with many others. The Duke was in gloomy wrath, Le Glorieux was full of wicked gaiety. ""Uncle,"" cried he to Charles, ""this is the prettiest way of being like Hannibal that I ever saw.""

And another from *Fools Are Everywhere*, attributed to Will Somers, fool to Henry VIII:
>His Majesty after some discourse growing into some good liking of him, said; fellow, wilt thou be my fool? who answered him again, that he had rather be his own father's still, then the king asking him why? he told him again, that his father had got him a fool for himself, (having but one wife) and no body could justly claim him from him: now you have had so many wives, and still living in hope to have more, why, of some one of them, cannot you get a fool as he did? and so you shall be sure to have a fool of your own.

857,AskHistorians,"I'm a farmer in mid 10th century Byzantium and a man comes to collect my taxes, how do I know I'm giving my taxes to the right man? If i give my taxes to the wrong man, am I obligated to pay them again?","Distribution of land ownership and use in the rural Byzantine Empire was definitely not even. By the eleventh century, there are some very powerful large-scale landholders (including monasteries, although at least in urban areas, sometimes even a monastery was controlled by an aristocrat), a few small landowners hanging in there, and then most of the population would have been *paroikoi* or dependent peasants: tenant farmers. 

For the powerful landowners, including monasteries, tax collection was mostly a game of tax *evasion*. Tax collectors remained a popular bogeyman of Byzantine literature and art as they had been in Roman times, and this hostility was mirrored by practice. Owners might work to avoid periodic visits by imperial tax assessors to revaluate their land at a higher tax amount, pay their taxes using a debased currency, or send someone chasing after a tax collector to steal back the money. (Anna Komnene tells a similar story in her *Alexiad.*)

Most Byzantine people, however, were peasants who were responsible for paying their taxes (a) collectively and (b) often indirectly. The tenant farmers paid most of their tax burden to the owner of their land. In a case like that, they would presumably be fairly familiar with the people involved. Otherwise, taxes were levied collectively on a village. This had the advantage, for the peasants, of helping out if one family had a rough year. It had the disadvantage of--one of the reasons for this system--that local land abandoned or unfarmed was still part of the total levy for an area. So people had to cover for each other. But tax evasion was at least sometimes practiced by peasants--or at least, financial documents complain about peasants who simply *disappear* when they know a tax collector is in the area!

As for identifying the tax collectors themselves: at least some tax officials, most prominently the *kommerkiarioi* (who, as their name indicates, were involved with regulating commerce), had official imperial seals. [This Google Books preview](https://books.google.com/books?id=86Of2XxW2NMC&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=tax+collector&source=bl&ots=QrkuiQ01ca&sig=zyIlQMc72Xz_EP0bBx8c4pRfV40&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiZ3bmDioTRAhVJ5GMKHf9aCMgQ6AEINDAE#v=snippet&q=collector&f=false) shows a couple of them, although they are both ninth century. Seals were pretty serious business in medieval Europe. The collective payment and indirect payment methods certainly suggest that at least some of the people involved would have been able to recognize the seal for what it was (medieval peasants are, as a rule, stereotyped in contemporary sources as stupid, but at least from later legal sources we can see a good deal of ability to negotiate successfully the demands of a more literate and educated ""elite"" culture)."
858,AskHistorians,"Marcus Aurelius, one of the ""five good emperors"" and author of 'Meditations', is known to have been addicted to opium; was opium use common among the elites at the time? Would the general public have had access to it? Was there any stigma attached to its use or the dependence on it?","Although opium was fairly widespread in the Roman period, its use seems to have been almost exclusively medical. 

Marcus Aurelius took his opium in theriac, which his physician, the great doctor Galen, prescribed as a remedy for his many ailments. According to Galen, in fact, Theriac could do just about anything. It counteracted every poison; quieted internal ailments; dispelled gout, chills, and sciatica; and even provided a hearty boost to the sex drive (*On Antidotes* 2.9). This marvelous concoction incorporated dozens of ingredients, many of them exotic and expensive spices. A few of these ingredients (such as myrrh) may have had positive effects; a few others (like the viper flesh that formed a key component) cannot have done convalescing digestive systems any favors. The opium, however, was quite potent. 

The opium in theriac produced noticeable effects on Marcus. According to Galen, the emperor would order the opium left out of his theriac whenever he felt himself growing tired in the middle of the day. At night, however, he found himself unable to sleep without opiated theriac, and seems to have become dependent on it. We hear about Marcus' use of theriac even during the Marcomannic Wars:

""Yet \[Marcus\] was so frail in body that at first he could not endure the cold, but even after the soldiers had assembled at his command he would retire before addressing a word to them; and he took but very little food and that always at night. It was never his practice to eat during the daytime, unless it were some of the drug called theriac. This drug he took, not so much because he feared anything \[i.e. poison\], as because his stomach and chest were in bad condition; and it is reported that this practice enabled him to endure both this and other maladies."" (Cass. Dio 71.6)

Interestingly, theriac seems to have become trendy among the Roman elite during Marcus' reign. As Galen reports: 

""Marcus being emperor, theriac was prepared by many rich people and because of this, some products hard to procure were left aside \[in the making of this medication\]. It is remarkable how the rich emulate the imperial tastes (or at least desire to be seen to emulate them). When the first among the men \[i.e. the Emperor\] died, very few continued to prepare the antidote..."" (*On Antidotes* 1.4)

On a less elevated social plane, opium was widely prescribed by doctors (above all as a sleep aid), and could be readily purchased (Galen mentions a good opium seller just off the Via Sacra in the Roman Forum). The first-century physician Dioscorides describes various preparations of opium:

""\[Poppy\] leaves and heads (boiled in water and applied with hot cloths) cause sleep. A decoction is taken as a drink against lack of sleep. The heads (pounded into small pieces and mixed into poultices with polenta) are good for inflammation and erysipela \[streptococcal skin infection\]. It is necessary for those who beat them when they are green to make them into tablets, dry them for storage, and then use them. The heads are boiled alone in water until half, and then boiled again with honey until the dullness is thickened, make a licking medicine soothing for coughs, dripping fluids in the throat, and abdominal afflictions."" (4.64)

Despite its many uses, Dioscorides notes, opium use has its dangers:

""A little of it...is a pain-easer, a sleep-causer, and a digester, helping coughs and abdominal cavity afflictions. Taken as a drink too often it hurts (making men lethargic) and it kills."" (4.64)

The soporific and hallucinogenic effects of opium seem, in fact, to have been widely recognized. Magical papyri discovered in Egypt, for example, describe how to create an opium-based potion that will cast one's enemies into an ""evil sleep."" 

The Romans do not seem to have recognized, however, that opium was addictive. Although it is clear that some Romans (like Marcus Aurelius) became dependent, we hear nothing about opium addicts or anything resembling a drug subculture. Opium use, accordingly was neither regulated nor stigmatized. If you could afford it, and it was available, it was used without reservation to beckon sleep or dampen pain."
859,AskHistorians,"Why, 150 years after the Civil War, is the US so seemingly more affected by the scars of slavery than other WH countries, even those whose experience was harsher (esp. where sugar was the primary crop)? Is this just a myopic view, or is something else making the US a special case?",WH countries? Western Hemisphere?
860,AskHistorians,"What was the mood like in Germany when news of the end of the (European) War broke in 1945? Were the public generally glad it was over, happy at being ""liberated"", devastated by defeat? Was there tension between celebrating Allied soldiers and locals?",">If you'd just surrendered in 1940, none of this would have had to happen.

It's a rough quotation I read long ago, communicated by a British officer, of what he was told by an old German woman just as the war was ending. Its stuck with me because it is both dark and humorous, after the entire conflict the woman blaming the winners for, ya' know, winning.

Anyways though, this one anecdote sums up the perspective of *some*, a mix of despair at the destruction wrought on Germany, and anger at the Allies for causing it, as opposed to the German leadership for bringing it about. Even those glad the fighting was at an end still has the dark reality of circumstances to face, after all. In any case though, by no means is there one, consistent perspective.

For many, imprisoned by the Germans in Concentration Camps, the end of the war was a godsend. I've written previously about those last days and hearing the news previously, specifically focusing on its portrayal in *Schindler's List*, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/cs0lfl/at_the_end_of_schindlers_list_it_depicts_all_the/exd6gvw/). In camps already liberated, news was received quicker of course, and the jubilee less restrained. an observer at Mittelbau-Dora recalled how the former prisoners celebrated on the 7th:

>An imposing, impromptu victory celebration was hastily arranged by the camp authorities. People were dancing and singing at the site of the old Appellplatz, All kinds of performances took place. The orchestra played the popular songs of the era. The survivors enjoyed their new attained, precious freedom.

Others though, while free, could only contemplate the horrors they had faced and those who didn't survive. Recovering in hospital at the Bergen-Belsen, Margit Schonfeld remembered how:

>I heard from very far the sound of bells, somebody told me ""the war is over"" but I felt no joy. I knew that my whole family was wiped out. I felt miserable and thought I was dying.

For hundreds of thousands of German soldiers, the first days of May were likewise welcome. ""Stragglers"" had long become an endemic problem as thousands of soldiers claiming to be separated from their unit wandered away from the front in the final months of the war, and plenty of those who didn't take that step certainly contemplated it. Especially in the West, facing the Western Allies, soldiers generally didn't need to be told twice to stop fighting, and began stacking their arms in earnest once told. This wasn't quite universal though, as diehards remained in the ranks. The Waffen-SS was often the most reticent to acknowledge the end had finally come, and while the Wehrmacht complacently walked into captivity, many SS units remained armed. 

Chronicling those final days, the British reporter George McCarthy recounted his brief captivity at their hands, when he accompanied a small British unit of 24 men that was traveling through northern Germany to enter Denmark on May 7th. They passed by thousands of German soldiers who didn't pay them any mind, but the Waffen-SS they encountered it was only a ""truce"", and that they didn't need to disarm, and attempted to prevent their passage, holding the small group for half an hour, until their commander was prevailed upon to get new orders, although they were soon let go in any case when a larger contingent passed through, and the Germans at the least didn't have the willingness to resist a force that size.

To the East, things were less easy going. The rumors of possible horrors that faced anyone who was captured by the Soviets ensured a deeper willingness to fight to the end, or if possible, make ones' way west. One of the very last engagements of the war against Germany was fought on May 7th. The Americans had made it to the bank of the Elbe, and thus were able to see the Soviets and Germans continuing their desperate fight even as the war was at a close and the Red Army pushed the Germans against the river, holding a 1,000 yard bridgehead and fighting a desperate delaying action to try and hold the crossings as long as possible. James Wellard, a journalist at the front wrote of what he saw:

>It was fought 200 yards from me between thousands of disorganised, hysterical, screaming Germans, and the implacable, ruthless Russian tanks and infantry. From the top of an American tank, which, if it had opened fire, could have slaughtered hundreds of Germans at point-blank range, I saw scenes so fantastic that they surpass anything I have seen in four years of war.

It wasn't only soldiers dying, as many civilians also attempted to cross Tangermüde bridge as the Americans watched passively, and plenty didn't make it, the bridge itself destroyed and crossing only possible over a jury-rigged walkway. Wellard thought quite poorly of the Germans, accusing the German army of ""being cowardly degenerates"" for their behavior as he described the scene, with the soldiers giving little concern for the civilians by the end, recounting scenes of soldiers pushing old women out of their little boat to take it for themselves. And although he noted some 50,000 Germans crossed that point over five days, he catalogs the types of people he saw, including many generals and staff officers, who fled at the expense of those few willing to hold the rear guard. 

In the end, this is only a small slice of responses one could find, and I hope others will weigh in with their own alternatives as well. I need to take a break, but I feel this is complete enough to post, although do check back later since I'll add a few more perspectives if I have the time later.

861,AskHistorians,There was a time when everyone smoked cigarettes because the dangers of smoking hadn't been discovered yet. But did the public have any idea that cigarettes produced negative health effects? How did they explain away coughing fits and other respiratory problems associated with smoking regularly?,"Disclaimer, I’m an epidemiologist, not a historian. To answer the above question briefly, smoking was suggested as a cause of health problems for much of the first half of the 20th century, but there was a real fight in the medical literature about whether or not it could be proven as a cause of the more serious health effects. As such, smoking likely didn’t seem very dangerous.  

I’m going to mostly stick to lung cancer rather than more common conditions, like coughing, since that’s better recorded in the literature. Lung cancer was incredibly rare prior to the 20th century, so much so that in “1900 only about 140 cases were known in the published medical literature” (Proctor, RN 2012).  That’s 140 cases ever, rather than 140 cases per year. Smoking became more commonplace towards the end of the 1800s and the first decades of the 1900s, but the increase in lung cancer took some time. By the 1920s, lung cancer was much more frequent than it used to be, and there were a variety of reasons given for this increase. Smoking was blamed, but so was asphalt dust, industrial air pollution, prior exposure to the poison gases used in WWI, or even the latent effects of the 1918 global influenza.  

So while smoking was blamed, it certainly wasn’t accepted as the cause of lung cancer, particularly by the medical field. Part of the reason for this was the model/concept of how causes for diseases were determined. 

During the end of the 1800s and the early 1900s, the primary conceptual model for how to determine a causative relationship between a particular exposure (e.g., microbe) and a particular disease were Koch’s postulates (published 1890).  There were four basic criteria that had to be met for a microbe to be a cause of some disease: 1. those with the disease must have the microbe present in their tissue; 2. The microbe has to be isolated and grown in pure culture; 3. When injected into a healthy animal, that microbe must cause the disease; and 4. You have to isolate the same microbe from the newly infected and diseased animal. 

Koch’s criteria for establishing a cause of a disease really break down when it comes to most environmental exposures. Often, a single exposure (like smoking) can cause many different health outcomes (lung cancer, heart disease, death), so you don’t get a good one-to-one relationship like the microbe and infectious disease relationships that were being proved using Koch’s postulates. 

So researchers were sort of in a stage of “association does not equal causation” stage. One quote to illustrate: “While most students of the problem of the aetiology of lung cancer admit to an association between smoking and lung cancer, some question whether this association also represents causation” (Wynder, E.L. 1957)

There really needed to be an avalanche of evidence for the smoking-lung cancer causation to be proven. And there was. Chemists found cancer-causing chemicals in cigarette smoke, cell line experiments found that cigarette smoke caused damage to cells that were similar to lung cells, animal experiments found that tumors could be created by painting cigarette smoke tar onto the skin of mice, and there were several population studies of smokers and non-smokers showing increased incidence of lung cancer, heart disease, and mortality not only among smokers compared to non-smokers, but among heavier smokers compared to more casual smokers. 

Even so, many in the public and even doctors were unconvinced. 
“In 1954, for example, George Gallup sampled a broad swath of the US public to ask: ‘do you think cigarette smoking is one of the causes of lung cancer, or not?’ 41% answered ‘yes’, with the remainder answering either ‘no’ or ‘undecided’. Even large numbers of doctors remained unconvinced. In 1960, in a poll organised by the American Cancer Society, only a third of all US doctors agreed that cigarette smoking should be considered ‘a major cause of lung cancer’. This same poll revealed that 43% of all American doctors were still smoking cigarettes on a regular basis, with occasional users accounting for another 5%. With half of all doctors smoking, it should come as no surprise that most Americans remained unconvinced of life-threatening harms from the habit.” –Proctor,RN 2011

The public at the time was probably used to seeing many of their peers smoking, with no apparent health effects (it takes years for these to develop), and it was a habit they likely enjoyed. Researchers were still arguing about how to go about proving causation, so for many, it probably seemed like cigarettes weren’t all that bad. 

It might make more sense to think about a health exposure that might be harmful today. The generation that smoked was probably very similar to our generation with regard to eating unhealthy food or not exercising, in that there were likely some observable, well-recognized drawbacks, but not enough to stop altogether. Smoking was likely known to have some downsides like coughing, but the sense that a single cigarette was dangerous just wasn’t there.

862,AskHistorians,"In the Disney movie Aristocats, there was a system of pipes that ran throughout the house that were apparently used to communicate between rooms. Were pipes like these ever used in history, or is this just an invention for the movie?","Yes. They are called, simply enough, ‘[speaking tubes](https://imgur.com/a/tzDvhmC)’. They were common on ships and there was even a sort of hand held version that allowed copilots to communicate with pilots over the roar of an open cockpit and a propellor ([here’s a French example, as Aristocats is set in Paris)](https://imgur.com/a/Answx4E). If you’ve been to a playground in recent years you may have even encountered a version of [them](https://imgur.com/a/lEkGFSo) that is relatively unchanged in design. The conical shape amplifies the noise coming out (in the same way you can put your phone in a bowl to act as a louder speaker), and the hollow air filled tube allowed the sound to cross distances/walls/stories without being interrupted. In short, they were proto-intercoms before the advent of the telephone by Antonio Meucci or Alexander Graham Bell (depending on which side you are on). When Bell and Meucci (they shared a lab) were experimenting in the 1870s with what become the telephone, they called it a ‘harmonic telegraph’, and Meucci had previously installed speaking tubes in his home.

We can see this ‘telegraph but for sound’ terminology at play in the speaking tubes that predate the telephone. A 1849 article in Scientific America called the speaking tube a  ‘acoustic telegraph’ that would enable people to converse with friends ‘as far as 60 miles away’ by speaking through a tube made of ‘gutta percha’, which was a proto-plastic latex material sourced from Southeast Asian trees. The 60 miles claim is preposterous, but perhaps laid the ground for what a telephone would be able to do decades later. 

A century before the Aristocats was set, Jean-Baptiste Biot had experimented with using water pipes of Paris apartments to see how sound traveled, and found that the thin confines of the piping served to keep speech intelligible over at least 1040 yards. There was a limit to how well voices could travel, and Biot found that any increase in the diameter of pipes decreased intelligibility. The ‘transmitted signal fell within the 200 hertz to 5000 hertz frequency range, which just so happens to be an excellent range of frequencies for human speech’. The tube's geometry -- small in diameter, with rigid metal walls -- served as an excellent acoustic filer, since those mid-range frequencies could travel through the tube far more efficiently than very high or very low frequency sounds’. To maintain privacy, the end of the tube would be covered by a whistle valve. If someone wanted to communicate, he or she would open the valve and blow through the tube, producing a whistling noise. Then whoever was on the other end would know to open their valve as well, and the two parties could have a spoken conversation through the tube, speaking into or receiving the sounds using the conical amplification of the flared ends.

But the advent of the speaking tube wasn’t, at first, meant for residential applications like you see in the Aristocats. Instead the technology was sold to as being ‘extremely useful for communication within factories, foundries and other public buildings’- basically loud spaces where ‘time was money’ and any way to speed up communication could be sold as a way to increase profits and production (in much the same way the telegraph was first employed. If you have access to it, there is a great article on the development of the telegraph in Germany that unpacks the business embrace of these communication technologies and the ways it then shaped spaces [here](https://academic.oup.com/gh/article-abstract/38/1/47/5670812)). If you want to see Disney playing with this idea prior to the Aristocats, look no further than this [Donald Duck short where he works in the gift wrapping basement of a Department Store.](https://youtu.be/puvXgHVj1a0) 

For the home application, you have to look toward, appropriately enough, the aristocrats. Well, more accurately you’d have to look to the nouveau riche. In the mid to late nineteenth century industrialisation turned business and factory owners into the new wealthy upper class. These men then brought their work home, so to speak. If you ever watch a period piece like Downton Abbey, you’ll be familiar with the system of [pull bells](https://imgur.com/a/0SMiygt) that allow the upper house to call on the servants. Speaking tubes were the logical next step, in that they allowed one to speak directly to the staff, without first having to ring for them, then wait for them to arrive, then speak. ‘Time is money’ but at home. Why the nouveau riche championing this technology? For starters, there is the stereotypical idea that the traditional upper classes were, well, traditional (in that they did not embrace change and new gadgetry in the same way as newer wealthy homeowners might). Think again to the episode of Downton Abbey about the hesitation of installing a wireless radio. But more practically, newly built houses could install speaking tubes in a way that would have been much less destructive than running pipes into the walls of old inherited stately manors.  

TL;DR- Speaking tubes allowed for the newly bourgeois individuals (or cats as the case may be) to show off cutting edge communication technology within their home, using it to address the same artifices of established elites, being able to interact with the downstairs staff without having to literally lower ones standing by going downstairs."
863,AskHistorians,"How is Yuengling, a company founded in 1829, America's oldest brewery? That is, that seems fairly late in the US of America's existence for a brewery to be established, including the colonial period. Were their older breweries that went under - and why? Was it a risky business?","The short answer is that the oldest breweries in the country at the time Prohibition began weren't big enough to survive after extensive competition with emerging national conglomerates. Yeungling was among the only East Coast breweries to do so, with most of the rest of the Prohibition survivors being the giants of the industry: Pabst, Schlitz, Anhueser-Busch, Miller, and Blatz being the most notable. Those giants spent Prohibition buying up as much competitive advantage as they could, and reentered the market with force, strangling small breweries even faster than they had prior to Volstead Act.

Yeungling wasn't the first brewery established in the United States. It was the oldest brewery to survive Prohibition and rampant competition with the emerging Beer Barons (I wonder, if marijuana becomes legal, if the era of the eighteenth amendment will still be referenced as capital-P Prohibition).

The first driver for the mass extinction of breweries was actually the railroad (1). As the railroads expanded, shipping became relatively cheap, and despite more and more beer being consumed by American workers, the rising giants of the industry were able to steeply undercut the relatively small, local operations. Peaking just shy of 3,000 breweries (producing around 6.6 million barrels annually) in the country in 1870, just over 1,200 (producing north of 60 million barrels annually) would enter the Prohibition era to fight for their lives. Cheap beer from the Beer Barons was being distributed around the country, and the city of Milwaukee was becoming known for its beer and whiskey production.

Prohibition was an odd beast, not least because, like any massive legal movement in the United States, compromises had to be made to the vast regional conglomeration. It stemmed from a broad-party basis; which is to say some very, very diverse groups supported it. Women's rights movements were tied in heavily to the Temperance movement; Susan B Anthony is probably one of the most-known advocates today of Prohibition (2). Xenophobes and racists also supported prohibition; like the attempts of white supremacists in the '60s to ban guns, they were aimed at black people and immigrants with the assumptions that loopholes could be crafted to allow whites continued access (3). Anti-corruption advocates joined the parade as well, as banning the saloons where many corrupt politicians and political machines would have their infamous back-room meetings as well as solicit pay-for-vote schemes (3). Various Protestant religious factions, such as the Methodists, who refused to drink for religious reasons also formed a backbone of the movement.

*However*.

Few of these people actually wanted to full ban alcohol (3). Some of the Protestants wanted a full ban, but many used wine in communal services, as an example. Further, there was, as in any issue, significant opposition, such as those lawmakers who lived in parts of the country famous for alcohol production; the Beer Barons of Milwaukee, the fledgling vineyards of California, and the whiskey-distillers in the Deep South (1). So, what kind of compromises were made?

Well, there's a few that are commonly known. The consumption of alcohol wasn't banned; simply its sale. Vineyards in California (and other parts of the country) actually exploded as soon as the implications were clear. They would sell dried grapes in bricks, with specific things to avoid doing to your brick of dried grapes, as it would result in wine. Bathtub gin and moonshine took off. Pharmacists were still allowed to sell whiskey, which had been stored in great barrels in storehouses, and organized crime started hiring druggists left, right, and center to treat the surprising number of flu cases that sprang up. Chicago tripled its pharmacies in just a few years. The longest-serving bar in the great state of Wisconsin obtained a druggists' license to serve bitters, as it didn't require a prescription to sell. Fake Rabbis could dispense booze, and, of course, the mafia had their hay day (3).
But, the one industry that truly suffered was the beer brewing industry. 

The wine industry, if anything, sprung into new life from its relative nascency. The spirits industry took an odd turn, finding loopholes to sell beer via druggists and pharmacies, and storing reserves, waiting for the 21st Amendment. Many distilleries closed as well, though their products continued to flow through the market. But the brewers simply had too many obstacles (3). Beer wouldn't keep for years the way spirits would. It couldn't be conveniently made at home as easily as wine (though malt syrup was produced and sold, a product that could be converted to beer in a home environment). So brewers continued to fall. The big boys converted to malt beverage (near beer), and lobbied the government for the right to make some small amounts of beer for “medical purposes.” This allowed those larger breweries to keep trained brewers around and on hand, manning the equipment. (1) Further, many of the larger brewing conglomerates made offers to smaller brewers to buy their equipment; at a steep discount, of course. To business owners who could not operate their businesses, this was a frequently-chosen option.

Once Prohibition ended, in 1933, only around 750 breweries remained in the country. At that point, the Milwaukee brewers sprang into action in a new way, using their cheaply-acquired equipment to pump out enough beer to float the city of Chicago, and most of the Midwest. Their continuous investment throughout Prohibition actually made them stronger, and more competitive, than they had been prior, when they were already dominating the market. Those 750 breweries continued to dwindle in the face of the extremely cost-effective juggernauts of Miller and Anhueser-Busch, including other Baron breweries such as Blatz and Schlitz. By 1980, barely 100 breweries remained in the country, down from over 2,900 just 110 years earlier.

864,AskHistorians,"Is there any reason why ""cool"" has had such a cultural sticking power while other slang terms have frequently come and gone?","Joel Dinerstein tells the philosophical and cultural part of the story in *The Origins of Cool in Postwar America.* Although he doesn't use these terms exactly, he argues that ""cool"" entrenched itself in English vocabulary because its surface meaning in the 1940s tapped into a deeper, underlying ethos in American and European society that transcended the specific, narrow manifestation of its original useage--and the specific, narrow set of people to whom that manifestation applied.

The English language (and many others), of course, has a rich tradition of using temperature metaphors for human behavior. ""Hothead"" for a quick-to-anger person goes back to the 17th century; ""cold"" and ""cool"" to describe someone emotionless or dispassionate--think ""ice queen"" or a ""glacial"" expression--are already found in their Old English equivalents! The concept of *coolness*, however, is more recent. 

This use of ""cool"" emerged into wider consciousness in and through jazz musicians and music in the late 1930s and 1940s.  In particular, black jazz artists deployed the term to define a certain sensibility, a way of playing music and of *being* in the world. ""That's cool"" or ""I'm cool"" or ""keeping cool"" united the ideas of control, relaxation, intensity, individuality, and conscious presentation/performance--against hostile external forces. ([This follow-up question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7ptwel/is_there_any_reason_why_cool_has_had_such_a/dskqxa2/) explains why contemporary African-American jazz musicians found particular power in hot/cold metaphors.) In the songs of black musicians of the 1940s, like ""Keep Cool, Fool"" (Erskine Hawkins) and ""Stay Cool"" (Count Basie), the significance of ""controlled, relaxed intensity"" in the face of toxic white culture stands out starkly: sharper-than-glass public composure and conscious, rational self-creation fly in the face of the range of pop cultural stereotypes of African-American men--the Angry Black Man, the peppy and dim-witted minstrel figure, the obsequious and self-negating Uncle Tom.

Thus, the manifestation of ""cool"" by black jazz musicians had a contextualized social power specific to black culture, and especially black masculinity. But Dinerstein argues that as the *word* cool leeched into broader (not just black, not just music-related) useage, people glommed onto not its *surface* meaning but its underlying one.

Although ""cool"" first emerged in the late 1930s, Dinerstein argues, the instrinsic message was exactly what the traumatized post-World War II, late imperialist West wanted and needed to hear. ""Cool"", on a deeper level, was the conscious construction of self as rebellion--a ""public mode of covert resistance.""

He ties the importance of this to a number of cultural currents in 1940s-50s America (and to a lesser extent Europe--America is his primary focus). World War II was an existential crisis/turning point for the West, an undeniable marker of the failure of its collective ideologies to *necessarily* make the world better instead of worse. In addition to realization of the horrors of the war and the Holocaust, the time period marked the earliest consciousness of Western white power that maybe Western imperialism was an *inherently bad* thing according to colonized people. And specific to the NATO bloc, you might call it, individualism was a politically promoted and powerful tool against the anxieties of nuclear war with Communists.

There was also further proddings at questioning a rock-hard system of necessary Christian virtue versus accepting the darker side of human emotionality to a limited, productive degree. And of course the war and its aftermath brought about a massive crisis in masculinity. (Masculinity is always in crisis, and masculinity in crisis is always causing things.)

Dinerstein traces early *specific* manifestations of this underlying sentiment through multiple Venn diagram circles of Western culture: black male jazz musicians, white male film noir protagonists, and white male and female existentialist philosophers (no, really). This is a fascinating, and more importantly compelling, choice of cultural nexuses because they appear, on the surface, so distinct from each other. But that is precisely his point: a given appearance of cool is almost beside the point. The underlying sense of ""conscious construction of self as rebellion, without people realizing it's an act"" was the meaning that people took--and more to the point, *take*--out of ""cool.""

There are some really interesting asides throughout the book that help convince me Dinerstein is on the right track with his philosophically-tinged cultural analysis. One point I really liked was the emergence of ""chill"" and ""to chill"" out of black culture in the 1980s. In other words: a time when and a group of people for whom *to choose to relax, to choose to opt out of Production* had become an act of social rebellion against welfare queen/entitlement rhetoric and the escalating societal value on giving everything to work.

I do think there's a second layer to the story here: the technological (in terms of engineering technological, but also social technology) reasons that a word emerging in a music subculture at the end of the 1930s would have *New Yorker* essays dropping it casually by 1955--essentially, the reasons that Parisian philosophers and Southern black musicians and Rust Belt white factory workers *could* connect to an underlying meaning in a word because their cultural orbits were common enough to be mutually intelligible. I would like to see some analysis of the role of radio and early television, especially, in streamlining transmission of a nebulous idea across what we today would see as disparate social groupings.

But overall, his portrayal of the underlying meaning of cool *through* its surface manifestations resonates even with our current, memetastic version: [*Look, look at all the fucks I give.*](https://imgur.com/a/Wo7L6)"
865,AskHistorians,"In the movie ""Nuremberg"", Hermann Goering expects to be treated like a honored guest by the Allies; he is visibly shocked after being put in handcuffs and declared a war criminal. Did the Nazis really expect leniency from the Allies?","There was some feeling among a few of the elite that they would be able to deal with the Allies on a military and Governmental level, particularly evidenced by Himmler's attempt to make a peace deal while Hitler was still alive. 

That said, I feel Goering was in a different world in many ways near the end. Himmler realized quickly that there would be no Reich after the war ended and he, among other leading Nazis, would be prosecuted for his crimes. He went into hiding, to famously be caught later and subsequently committing suicide. Goering however was heavily drugged up for some time which could have played a part in his mindset. He also felt that he had nothing to apologize about (making quite a show of himself during the trials after his capture) and overall did not feel like the criminal he really was. Also of note, he had quite the ego... though that's a bit speculative for this sub, just thought it was worth a mention. I believe he did write a letter to Eisenhower before his capture to discuss potential surrender terms, though I don't have my books around me right now. I may be wrong, remember reading this at some point, but if true leads me to further believe he truly felt that he was not in major risk of war crime charges.

The Nazi leaders expectations really were person to person. The large number of suicides in the last days of the Reich suggest to me that many leaders knew exactly what they had done and what they were in for. Many were involved not only directly in the Holocaust and general war crimes, but the attempts to cover up their crimes. Many that officially surrendered probably felt they had a chance in a court of law, and in fact some were able to get by with just prison time (most famous in my opinion being Albert Speer) as they were never directly involved in war crimes.

So, it was delusional in some cases, in others such as Goering it most definitely was, but it really was a case by case. Some showed remorse, though most didn't, Goering himself was defiant for the trials and obviously got the last laugh by killing himself.

Adding some sources:

For Goering specifically, I really liked Goering: The Rise and Fall of the Notorious Nazi Leader. 

General reading, which is most of my knowledge on the Third Reich, I have suggested this probably a couple of times here before - but I really do enjoy Richard Evans' trilogy. It's comprehensive and will give a great picture of many aspects of the Reich at the key time periods.

Speer's ""Inside the Third Reich"" is good, though obviously questionable, but he speaks about Goering and actions during the war in quite a few parts. Nothing comes to mind as ""proof he was a war criminal"", but most certainly there are sections about Goering making big decisions (and big promises) in regards to action on the Eastern Front. Though Goering was a ""likable"" Nazi on the whole and had a personality about him that people really seemed to trust... he most definitely was a criminal. If at the very least being one of the highest ranking Nazis for the duration of the Reich.

More edits..

/u/Crytash makes some good points about the suicides. Definitely a factor here, I would just say that though many did kill themselves for those reasons, there were many that simply knew what was coming. Maybe speculative as well, definitely an interesting argument.

Also, you are right about Kershaw's ""The End"", very good book about the chaos during the last year and some of the motivations behind the actions taken by the Nazis."
866,AskHistorians,Soap was first invented around 2800 BCE. This was literal thousands of years before we discovered bacteria and viruses or came up with germ theory. Did we just get really lucky that soap kills these microorganisms?,"This question better suits /r/askscience, since the answer you're looking for is based on the molecular structure of soap. However, let me give you an answer regarding the way soap works and why ""we got really lucky"". (I hope this doesn't break the rules of the sub, since it's not really focused on history. If it does break the rules, please delete.)

Soap can be produced through different processes and with different ingredients, but virtually all soap has one thing in common: the individual soap molecules have a hydrophilic (water-loving) & lipophobic (oil-fearing) head and a lipophilic (oil-loving) & hydrophobic (water-fearing) tail. This molecule structure enables soap and water to remove oily substances from surfaces, which water alone can not clean. 

The lipophilic tails of the soap molecules bind to individual oil molecules covering the surface and, in doing so, break bonds between the oil molecules. The hydrophilic tails, on the other hand, bind to the molecules of the water used in the cleaning process. Rinsing the soapy surface with water removes those bonded water-soap-oil molecules. Rubbing or brushing the soapy surface before rinsing, increases the ability of the soap molecules to break the bonds between the oil molecules.

This cleaning process is and has been useful for all kinds of circumstances, including hygiene, but mainly the cleaning of tools and other objects of use.

Now, here is where ""we got really lucky"". Many bacteria and viruses, including the Corona virus family, have a lipid layer in their outer membrane. These lipids are exactly what the lipophilic tails of the soap molecules like to bond to and, in doing so, they do exactly what they do on an oily surface: they break the bonds between the lipid molecules and thereby destroy the membranes.

However, not all bacteria and viruses have an outer lipid membrane. E.g. gram positive bacteria have a cell wall around the membrane. Those bacteria and viruses may not be destroyed by the soap but simply removed from surfaces (our bodies) by breaking the bonds in the oily film (on our skin or on tools) to which they stick."
867,AskHistorians,"Supposedly the dish called the Hangtown Fry got its name because a man on death row delayed his execution by asking for an oyster omelet, so law enforcement had to undertake a week’s ride on horseback to get the ingredients. Were ""last meal requests"" ever really honored so rigorously?","I got impatient waiting for a response so I looked into it myself: fulfilling last meal requests to the letter depended heavily on the local laws and customs, and honoring the request wasn’t normally a matter of law but of tradition. The Hangtown Fry legend you mention wasn’t quite an outlier in terms of how far authorities would go to fulfill a request, as, historically, last meal requests were treated similarly to requests a law-abiding citizen might make on their death bed - namely, very seriously. 

There was a definite religious component to it that can be traced back to prominence in medieval Christian Europe. There were parallels between Jesus’s Last Supper and a convict choosing their final meal: a prisoner breaking bread with their executioners is one following the example Jesus set via inviting Judas to the Last Supper. Superstition played a role in ensuring the quality of food during their final meals, where the spirits of those executed might torment the executioners if they received a terrible meal.

But your question sounds more US-focused so I’ll center on America’s approach to such requests before the 21st century. One example includes the last meal requests at Sing Sing in the 1960s: the condemned could ask for both a final dinner and a final supper, which could also include asking for tobacco products like cigarettes and snuff. Murderer Henry Flakes, who was executed in 1960 at Sing Sing, took advantage of both by ordering feasts for both his supper and dinner that included four packs of cigarettes at dinner and four cigars at supper. 

The wardens and executioners did their best to fulfill the condemned’s final requests even when it was not quite legal, as we can see with stories of inmates given alcohol during Prohibition. The titular case at this time was for the 1925 execution of Patrick Murphy at Sing Sing, who begged Warden Lewis Lawes for a final drink. The warden did slip him some bourbon (obviously breaking prison rules and the federal law doing so) and, reportedly, “Murphy took the bottle, looked at Lawes (who loathed executions) and died having returned the bottle to Lawes saying, “You look like you need it more than I do, Warden.””

There was a practical aspect to fulfilling these final requests of death row inmates, in that such requests kept the condemned “settled” and more accepting of the fact they were going to die. This extended to the rest of those on death row, whose day of reckoning was yet to come. At Sing Sing it wasn’t uncommon for the soon-to-be-executed to share the spoils with their fellow prisoners: in 1931 Francis ‘Two Gun’ Crowley shared his meal with fellow murderer John Resko, which was upstaged in 1951 when Raymond Fernandez shared it with all the rest of the condemned. Such generosity was considered a sort of parting gift to the rest, a final hurrah before being marched out to the grave. Denying a prisoner their final meal means that much more upset before, during, and after the execution, as the rest of death row wouldn’t look kindly on such a refusal.

868,AskHistorians,"Contrary to popular belief and according to primary Norse sources, Thor is NOT the god of thunder and the weather so how did Thor become associated with the sky and the weather?","Well, Crawford is an expert on Old Norse language but not necessarily on other aspects, nor does he seem to always do proper research as I've seen a video of his repeat false claims straight from Wikipedia articles. 

Anyway, there are no Norse primary sources from the Viking Age other than short runic inscriptions, none of which say much about Thor's role. The sources he is talking about are the Eddas and Sagas, which were written down some centuries later in Iceland in the 1100s-1300s. This is problematic; things get distorted over time, in particular the prose/oral stories. (poetry is more robust since you couldn't change it without messing up the meter) There's been a strong emphasis on _contemporaneity_ of sources in Viking Age Scandinavian historiography for the past century.

Further, the Eddas are folklore stories about the gods doing stuff. They're almost wholly unconcerned with the details of the actual religion, who people worshipped, how and when and why. You'll find some references to sacrifices (_blót_); you'll even find the question (""Do you know how to sacrifice?"" in _Hávamál_) but you will not find next to nothing saying much about how they were carried out, much less more minor customs.

But we do have a source saying Thor was a god of thunder and weather, namely Adam of Bremen's chronicle, written around 1070s-1080s, at which time paganism was still around in parts of Scandinavia, particularly Uppsala, which he is concerned with and doesn't consider the Swedish king to have be doing enough about. As Adam described it, there were three idols in the temple there, of Odin, Thor and _Fricco_ (generally read as Freyr), and these were gods of war, thunder/weather and fertility respectively, who were sacrificed to by those who wanted victory against enemies, who wanted good harvests, and those who wanted children, respectively.

Adam of Bremen is however not a primary source on this; he had never seen Uppsala. His account is also unreliable, containing many geographical inaccuracies and some fantastical elements. Yet for lack of much else it's an important source, and well-spread in its own time, it was influential also on those ""Norse sources"" from later. More importantly, there's not that much to doubt about this particular detail: There's ample evidence from things like place names that those three gods were worshiped around Uppsala (but also for instance Ullr, who's scarcely mentioned in Icelandic sources).

That said, most claims of Norse gods being ""the god of so-and-so"" are at best built on shaky ground. The god Týr's frequently claimed status as 'god of war' is based almost entirely on him having been assigned the week-day the Romans had assigned to Mars. A competing claim by Dumézil that Týr was a god of justice was based on his own reading of the myth of him losing his hand and because it fit into his conception of a common Indo-European justice-god tradition.

Many are even more dubious than that, for instance claiming Ullr was a god of hunting and skiing, because Snorri's Edda says that he was skilled at those things. More probable (IMO) is that Snorri extrapolated that description of the god from older _kennings_ referring to Ullr as a 'bow-god' and 'ski-god', but that those were originally references to stories about him lost by that point. (e.g. 'one-handed áss' is a kenning for Týr, clearly referencing the story his hand being bitten off by Fenrir. If you imagine that story had been forgotten, perhaps people would put that together with the 'war god' idea and claim he was the god of people who'd lost limbs in war) 

So this ""god-of-this-and-that"" thing may to some extent be a projection of Greco-Roman pantheon onto the Norse one. _However_, the problem with that, is that Greco-Roman influences on Norse culture go back all the way to the Roman Iron Age (~1-400 AD), named thusly because of the massive influx of Roman artifacts and influences. 

At the local level, religious customs among the average Scandinavians were quite heterogeneous, which we know from archaeological evidence, particularly variations in burial customs. The only truly religious practices that were completely ""Norse"", as in fairly homogeneous across Scandinavia, are those of the elite, who engaged in things like erecting burial mounds and ship burials. It's also doubtless that the sagas (which are largely about the doings of kings and elites) and Skaldic and Eddic poetry were composed by and for members of the elite. So there's every reason to think the elite's religious world-view was overrepresented in the later sources. And this was a religious world that was more shaped by Greco-Roman ideas than that of the common folk.

In other words, the average Scandinavian of the Viking Age may not have been particularly concerned with the whole pantheon to begin with. It's always been pure assumption to believe that what the Icelanders wrote down centuries later was an accurate portrayal of a homogeneous culture, but it's an assumption more challenged today than ever before. 

_That said_, Thor is **definitely** associated with thunder.  How could he not be? He is a personification of it. The name Þórr means ""thunder"" in Old Norse. Etymologically it's the same word as English 'thunder' too. (Proto-Germanic *þunraz - > þunor -> thunder in English, *þunraz -> þórR -> þórr in Old Norse) To this day, Scandinavian words for thunder reference Thor, e.g. Danish/Norwegian _torden_ ('Thor-noise/din') Swedish _tordön_ and the more euphemistic _åska_ ('travelling god/áss'). Also the Old Norse term _reið_ ('ride') could also mean 'thunder-storm'.

So there's reason to doubt the claims of gods being gods-of-things, but even reason to doubt that the gods were even that important. Yet at the same time, out of the gods, Thor simply cannot escape an association with thunder. 

Relations with Norse gods are consistently depicted as quite transactional - if you want something, you should perform a sacrifice (although as Hávamál also says, 'it is better to not ask than to sacrifice too much') Adam of Bremen's account is in-line with this, as is for instance Ibn-Fadlan's eyewitness account of Varangians performing sacrifices. Thor was a very popular god (as seen in for instance place name evidence), and that popularity is more easily explained by him being a god of weather and thus good harvests in these agricultural societies, than by him being a badass who goes around killing giants. Which is entertaining and all but perhaps not reason to (say) give up your best horse to him. (edit: the point here being that the mythological stories about the gods only had the loosest of connections to their cult)"
869,AskHistorians,California became a state in 1850. The Transcontinental Railroad was not completed until 1869. How did Senators and Representatives from California effectively travel between DC and California before the advent of rail?,"There were three ways to get from California to Washington D.C. at the time California became a state in 1850. The most direct route was overland, by wagon train, mostly via the Oregon Trail. This was also the slowest.

The second way was taking a steamship around the horn of South America. This was the most indirect route but still considerably faster than the overland route. But it was still dangerous and long, due to the rough waters south of South America.

The third way to go was to take a steamship to Panama, then disembark, travel by horse or mule-drawn wagon about twenty miles to the Chagres River, catch a riverboat to another steamship that would take you the rest of the way. This was the shortest and the least arduous, though of course it was still quite long. The trip across Panama itself could take 5 or more days, and each ocean voyage by steamship took at least a week, so the journey took 3 or 4 weeks total, depending on how long of a ""layover"" you had at each point along the way.

The first senators from California were John C. Fremont and William M. Gwin, who took the Panama route in early 1850. The Washington D.C. newspaper the *Daily Union* [reported on February 12, 1850](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82003410/1850-02-12/ed-1/seq-3/):

> ""We have had the pleasure of seeing Dr. William M. Gwin, one of the elected senators of California, who arrived in this city [Washington, D.C.] on Sunday morning last.
>
> ""Col. Fremont, the other senator, is unfortunately detained by the indisposition of his lady. Dr. Gwin left them at Panama.""

By 1855, the Panama Railroad was complete, which made the trip a bit easier. It was then a matter of catching a steamship to Panama, boarding an overland train that took less than a day, and then catching the steamship on the other side.

For more information, [this article](https://www.californiapioneers.org/news/getting-to-the-gold-fields/) published by the California Society of Pioneers gives some details as well as titles and info on many travel journals to and from California in the pre-Transcontinental Railroad era. 

One of the most relevant is the book *Mountains and Molehills: or, Recollections of a Burnt Journal* by Frank Marryat, an English immigrant to California who arrived for the Gold Rush in 1850 via the Panama route. He, of course, was going the opposite way as the California senators were going, but the book [opens with](https://archive.org/details/mountainsmolehil00marr/page/n17/mode/2up) Marryat describing the town at the mouth of the Chagres River in Panama coming into view, and then him traversing the country to get to the Pacific Coast. It was rather haphazard, with both Native Americans and U.S. expatriates being involved in the accomodations and travel. About halfway along the route he stayed at the ""Washington Hotel"" operated by a ""Yankee"" that wasn't much more than a wood hut. Once arriving in Panama City, he described:

> ""Since Panama has become the half-way resting- 
place of Californian emigration, the old ruin has 
assumed quite a lively aspect. Never were modern 
improvements so suddenly and so effectually applied 
to a dilapidated relic of former grandeur as here. The 
streets present a vista of enormous sign-boards, and 
American flags droop from every house. The main street is composed almost entirely of 
hotels, eating-houses, and ""hells.""""

I don't know what a ""hell"" is that he's describing, but it doesn't sound good. In any case, this travel route seemed to be the most popular until the building of the Transcontinental Railroad."
870,AskHistorians,Why is salt & pepper so universal across American diners? Was this a result of a adversting campaign or a national restaurant culture? When did it began?,"I don't know if it will answer your question, but it is not just common across American diners. They are ubiquitous in Europe too, in the southern countries usually accompanied by olive oil. I imagine they are also common in all the Mediterranean basin, although I am not sure of that. By the time of the settlement of the American colonies, in the 17th and 18th century, salt and pepper were already the most common ""spices"" used in Europe, so it is no surprise this tradition was carried on to the other side of the Atlantic.

Salt has been a staple ingredient of world cuisine for millennia. It could be called the ""first and most common of the spices"", and there's archeological evidence of it already being used around the year 6000 BC. ~~Salt can be mined relatively easy, as to get it you mostly need to evaporate seawater to extract the salt.~~ Salt is not endemic to any particular area, you can get it anywhere where there is access to the sea or, less common, where there are salt mines. It was a common ingredient in Antiquity, if somewhat expensive, as the production of salt was a costly and labour-intensive work, prone to health problems on the workers. We have uncovered rests of salt offerings in Ancient Egyptian tombs as far as the 3rd millennium BC, and by Roman Imperial times salt was incredibly common. There's the enduring myth that salt was used as a payment for early Roman soldiers, hence the word ""salary"", but that is just a speculation from Pliny the Elder, writing in the 1st century AD, when soldiers had been paid in cash for already many centuries.

Black pepper is a bit more rare ingredient, as it comes from a plant native to South and South East Asia, still the main producing region of this ingredient. Its use in India goes as back as 2000 BC. In the West, the first remains we have found are in the nostrils of the mummy of the Egyptian pharaoh Rameses II, who died in 1213 BC. In Classical Greece and the Hellenic period, black pepper was already a known item, but only common in the household of the most rich and influential people. It is by this time that trade between the Far East and the Mediterranean started to flourish, specially since the creation of the Achaemenid Empire which connected India and Europe. The land route was paralleled by a sea route, which went both through the Persian Gulf and also around the Arabian peninsula and through the Red Sea.

By the Early Roman Empire, the Red Sea route was the main one to get Indian products to the Mediterranean, bypassing the middlemen in the Persian Empire. The Greek geographer Strabo describes how the Empire sent an annual caravan of ships to India to get goods, and black pepper was one of the most sought after products. A cooking book thought to be compiled in the first century AD (Apicus) cites pepper in most of its recipes. Pliny the Elder, in his monumental *Natural History*, notes the price of black pepper being four denarii per pound, a considerable amount. Basing us in the annual salary of a Roman legionnaire of 225 denarii and comparing it to a modern soldier in a western country (between 15k and 35k dollars), it wouldn't be crazy to compare it to a current price of 400 dollars a roman pound (so $550 an Imperial pound or $1215/kg). A considerable amount for a regular person, but not prohibitive to the more affluent classes. Curiously, Pliny gives us a moralizing tale about pepper:

> It is quite surprising that the use of pepper has come so much into fashion, seeing that in other substances which we use, it is sometimes their sweetness, and sometimes their appearance that has attracted our notice; whereas, pepper has nothing in it that can plead as a recommendation to either fruit or berry, its only desirable quality being a certain pungency; and yet it is for this that we import it all the way from India! Who was the first to make trial of it as an article of food? and who, I wonder, was the man that was not content to prepare himself by hunger only for the satisfying of a greedy appetite?


Because of this steady stream of pepper, it would become common but scarce, a perfect luxury good; and because of its long lasting preservation, it was sometimes used as a valuable commodity when barter was necessary. When the Visigoth king Alaric sieged Rome in the early 5th century, black pepper was one of his demands for ransoming the city, 3000 pounds of it.

In the Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire, the Sassanids or the Arabs would become the middlemen bringing pepper into the Mediterranean, and then it would spread via the trading powers of Venice and Genoa. The prices would be significantly higher than in Roman times, considering the amount of middlemen and countries it would take to get it to the final consumer, so western European countries would be willing to open up new trade routes to break with the Arab+Italian monopoly on the spice trade. This desire would push Vasco da Gama, and then Columbus, to lead the Age of Exploration for getting spices from India, specially pepper, at a cheaper price. Later the Dutch and the English would join this push for cheaper trade with Asia, which combined with the plantations of pepper in the Americas (specifically Brazil) brought its price down to a level where even modest homes could afford to use it from time to time.

This lower prices, combined with a long and rich tradition of cooking with pepper in Europe, would make it one of the most common spices used in European cuisine, only surpassed by salt. It makes sense that restaurants and taverns in the Modern era would have it as a common condiment and would start offering it to customers, in case they wanted to spice up their dishes. This tradition would naturally be brought to the Americas by European colonists, and that is how it ended up being so ubiquitous all round the Western world."
871,AskHistorians,"In the 1864 Presidential Election, Lincoln won nearly every state, except Kentucky, where he lost to McClellan by 40 points. Lincoln won nearly 80% of votes in the Army, except in Kentucky, where McClellan won 70% of the Army vote. Why did Lincoln do so poorly in Kentucky?","So I think a good place to start here is to compare the *changes* in votes between 1860 and 1864.

If we look at the three states which Lincoln lost, in 1864, the results are thus:

State | Lincoln | McClellan
---|---|----
New Jersey | 47.2 | 52.8
Delaware | 48.2 | 51.8
Kentucky | 30.2 | 69.8

Now let's compare that to 1860:

State | Lincoln | Douglas | Breckinridge | Bell
---|---|---- | ---|---|----
New Jersey | 48.1 | 51.9 (sort of) | - | - 
Delaware | 23.7 | 6.6 | 45.5 | 24.1
Kentucky | 0.9 | 17.5 | 36.3 | 45.2

So the point I'm illustrating here is that in New Jersey, the vote didn't really change. A 1.1 point shift is pretty minor. In Delaware, while the support was in the minority, there *had* been support for Lincoln in 1860, so in 1864 it was building off of that, and many (but not all) of the various Unionists shifted over to Lincoln. There had been strong support for the Breckinridge ticket though, which was the least Unionist in sentiment. The same can be said for Kentucky with regards to the latter - some voters willing to shift to Lincoln in Unionist sentiment, - but there was a much lower baseline to build off of, and pre-existing support for the less Union inclined. Now, I'm not saying that there is a *clear*, guaranteed pattern of vote shift, but simply that the '64 results don't seem that strange given the utter lack of support Lincoln enjoyed in Kentucky, compared to the other two, in the previous election.

So, that now dispensed with, let's look a little more at Kentucky. As we have established, it was *Democratic* in sentiment. Even within the Unionist circles of Kentucky there was division, and lack of trust for Lincoln. While it is hardly unexpected that Lazarus Powell D-KY would, in 1864, decry the Administration's racial policies to note that ""I believe this Government was made by white men and for white men; and if it is ever preserved it must be preserved by white men"", strong racial sentiments also came from Unionists like Frank Wolford, who had been one of Lincoln's strongest supporters in the state back in 1861, funding the raising a cavalry regiment which he went on to lead honorably. When accepting a ceremonial sword from a Unionist group in March, 1864, he chose that opportunity to make a speech which was quite pointedly against Lincoln's decision to pursue Emancipation, let alone allowing black men to be *armed* and serve. Many in the audience were apparently uneasy with his statements, so it can hardly be said he represented Unionist sentiment as a whole in the state, but he certainly is indicative of the lack of a cohesive, united front from those who supported Union and war for it.

As for Wolford himself, he would be arrested and face a court martial for his expression of sentiment. Paroled by Lincoln, the President attempted to mend bridges, but his entreaty as to the correctness of the move only pushed Wolford further into his position. The trial didn't happen, but Wolford became a strong and vocal supporter of McClellan that fall, and after the election he - along with the Lt. Gov of the state, Richard Jacob, another McClellan surrogate in the state - would be arrested for rather specious accusations of treasonous sentiments. Sen. Powell raised quite a huff over the rearrests, eventually resulting in Wolford's release, and Jacob's return home - having been previously ""exiled"" South.

In any case though, Wolford is a good demonstration of what was at issue in Kentucky, and while certainly true in other states to degrees, simply not as impactful. It was the state which, more than any, Lincoln was reaching out to with the sentiments of the 'Conkling Letter':

>You say you will not fight to free negroes. Some of them seem willing to fight for you; but, no matter. Fight you, then exclusively to save the Union. I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the Union. Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the Union, if I shall urge you to continue fighting, it will be an apt time, then, for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes.

In sum, Unionists in Kentucky were, for the most part, *not* what we would term ""Unconditional Unionists"". They had limits in what they were willing to see happen, and seeing armed black men, and movement towards black equality in general, was a step too far for many, unwilling as they were to accept Lincoln's insistence that it was what he deemed necessary to win the war. We can see this writ large with reactions to the draft, as well. Even prior to the draft, the state had seen a decided lack of enthusiasm to fight - *for either side* - a general lack of response to calls for troops in the early stages, and then a lack of response to draft calls, with 'draft dodging' being over 75 percent! All in all, roughly 71 percent of white men in the state avoided uniforms of either kind. This compares to the *black* male population, which saw roughly 40 percent in uniform - and no doubt also only added to the further unease of tepid Unionists fearful of the future of racial supremacy.

Now, none of this is to say that there *weren't* Unconditional Unionists in the state, or at least those willing to vote for it. One good example would be William Harrison Randall, Representative for KY-8th, who had run as a Union Democrat willing to support Lincoln *except* for his racial policies, but he then, after election, showed his true colors and became a wholehearted supporter. Randall became one of the leaders of Lincoln's reelection campaign in the state, and played a not insignificant role in getting Lincoln even up to 30 percent. Tailoring stump speeches to the audience, he and his compatriots worked on statements that provided a strong concentration on military successes with poorer audiences, while focusing more on the issues of emancipation with wealthier constituents. Still though, whatever those gains, the largest group of Kentuckians remained Union Democrats, and their votes would still give be going to the Democratic candidate, which, when combined with those who were Peace Democrats, would remain the strong majority of the state. The end result is that a vote for McClellan wasn't a vote for one, single platform. Some were voting because they wanted the war to end, but some voters might have agreed with some, or even much, of Lincoln's prosecution of the war, but nevertheless were too uncomfortable with the direction of racial policies to give him their vote.

872,AskHistorians,Neo-Nazis are often heavily tattooed. But what did Hitler and the Nazis think of tattoos?,"Ok, so let me say, the history of the tattoo, while explored in various contexts – especially non-European ones apparently – hasn't been really well explored for Nazi Germany. However, what little scholarship there is, suggest something that is not very surprising: The Nazis weren't fans of tattoos except those that fulfilled a clear functionality like the SS blood type tattoos or the camp tattoos.

It seems there have been at least local laws in Germany heavily regulating tattoos or more specifically the public showing of tattoos since before the Nazis. The literature often mentions a 1911 prohibition of ""fully tattooed women in public"" though I could not verify if that was a local or national law. What little information there is, seems to suggest that it was local since there is at least one case of a woman in Berlin being escorted out of a bar because of her tattoos. That was Maria Finke, wife of Kuddi Finke, one of Germany's first prominent tattoo artists, who had tattooed his wife on her whole body.

Throughout the 1920s both tattooing as well as showing tattoos (a source of income for circus performers of the ""freak show"" variety) seems to have become more and more regulated in Germany. The most famous example of this is the Bracht'sche Erlass (Bracht's Decree) of 1932 in Prussia. Franz Bracht was the vice-Reichcommissar and commissar of the interior in Prussia after chancellor von Papen had effectively dissolved the SPD lead Prussian government in the so-called Preussenschlag and transferred its powers to the Reich government.

Bracht did many things during his time, both as vice commissar and later minister of the interior under Schleicher but one of them was to completely outlaw the showing of tattoos in public; a practice adopted shortly after in all of Germany, meaning that no one could show their tattoos in public and people could especially not earn a living from that.

This practice continued under the Nazis. Stephan Oettermann, a German cultural historian, mentions in his book *Zeichen auf der Haut. Die Geschichte der Tätowierung in Europa.* (Signs on Skin. A History of Tattoos in Europe) that the Nazis indeed outlawed both showing tattoos in public as well as tattooing itself and that having a tattoo was reason enough to get a person arrested and send to a concentration camp. While I couldn't wholly verify this information (the footnote Oettermann gives is a German book from the 70s I do not have access to atm), I could verify that in 1938 when the police initiated the ""Aktion Arbeitsscheu Reich"" (Action Work Shy Reich) during which people whom the Nazis called ""asocial"" were arrested in large numbers, one directive for the police about who to arrest reads:

> The police has to take action against all forms of showmanship, especially the kind that violates the healthy people's feelings (gesundes volksempfinden). This includes but is not is not limited to showmen of abnormal body (fish men, bird men, animal men and so forth but also tattoos. (...) If bodily health of those individuals allows they are to be brought to a mental facility.

Furthermore, what I could also verify is the fact that several well-known German tattoo artists were imprisoned in concentration camps, namely Wilhelm ""Willi"" E. Blumberg and Albert Heinze, two of the first professional tattoo artists in Germany. They too were swept up in ""anti-social"" actions though it is likely that the Nazis saw additional reasons to them being tattooed for such an action.

Traditionally, tattoos at that point in time were associated with either people whom the Nazis deemed anti-social or criminal (like actual criminals as well as people of low socio-economomic stratas) and sailors but on the latter group I could unfortunately not find much pertinent information.

Two exceptions were apparently made where tattoos fulfilled a practical function: Waffen-SS soldiers had bloodgroup tattoos and, of course, Auschwitz prisoners had their numbers tattooed. With Waffen-SS soldiers little information survives on how this practice started but the function was pretty obvious: To make medical aid easier. Oettermann tells of SS officers getting other tattoos as well but again, this is information I could not verify. 

In the camps, the practice started once in 1941 some camps and in particular Auschwitz had a large influx of former Soviet POWs. Originally, the prisoner numbers were sewn into clothing but when the appeareance of these groups lead to a lack of clothing, the practice of tattooing them started. This method was only applied in Auschwitz though while other camps issued badges.

All in all, the Nazis most likely associated with tattoos with so-called ""asocials"" and took active steps to persecute tattoo artists and those who earned a living through showing their tattoos. It is a likely guess that people with tattoos were not regarded too highly by them.

873,AskHistorians,The Versailles treaty's article 246 concerns the delivery of a human skull. What happened with it?,"Chief Mkwawa was a tribal leader of the Hehe. They were a tribe in German East Africa, a German colony which Germany acquired during the reign of William II. During the ""pacification"" of German East Africa, the Hehe rose in 1891 against the colonial troops. They were part of the Maji-Maji rebellion. They beat the Germans a couple of times. Ultimately however, the Hehe were beaten and their leader executed and his skull taken to Germany. There he was used as a prime example for an African leader and as such a good object for the research in phrenology. With racism rampant at the time, they tried to prove that the shape of the skull determined the intelligence and ""culture"" of its owner.
Then came the First World War and Germany lost and had to accept the Versaille's treaty. German East Africa was a colony, part of the Versaille's treaty was the hand-over of all German colonies over to the Völkerbund/League of Nations. The United Kingdom became the new ""protector/governor"" of the territories that made up the former colony. To make the hand-over easier and to make the local tribes more acceptive towards the new power, they asked the Germans to hand over the skull of the local hero of Mkwawa.

That's not the end of the story, however. The skull didn't make it there because nobody knew where it went. As you can tell from the book you mention. It took a very determined Englishman to finally find it in a museum in Bremen. That was in 1954. It now rests in Tanzania in a museum dedicated to Mkwawa and the Hehe.


They actually turned the story into a small documentary, which is, sadly, only available in German, as far as I know.

Most of the literature I know for this is in German as well. That comes from having studied at a german University, I guess.

874,AskHistorians,In 1604 there was a supernova that caused a star to be bright enough to be seen during day time. How was this interpreted at the time? Did any figures or groups try to capitalise on it for political or spiritual influence?,"Hopefully more people will be along to provide other perspectives!

Apparently, physican Baldassare Capra used the nova as an excuse to attack Galileo and make himself look better. Given the number of you who have heard of Galileo versus the number familiar with Capra, I think we can guess how *that* turned out.

There is, of course, a larger story here, one that is about either (1) what the ""new star"" was, whether it was actually new, was it a miraculous creation or the product of natural motions of the universe (2) which set of academics could explain it better, or (3) you see? you SEE? THE WORLD IS GOING TO END. LIKE, NOW.

Capra's accusation had nothing to do with any of that. He just wanted people to know that he had seen it first.

As Capra told the story, he had observed it one day along with his informal mentor and a non-academic but very rich Italian man. In his excitement, he later pointed it out to Giacomo Corano (another rich Italian man), and only then did Corano tell Galileo. But, Capra claimed angrily, Galileo had made no mention of his help in his lecture series.

Galileo *probably* ignored this attack publicly. (We'll get to that.) But one imagines that it contributed at least somewhat to the title he unleashed on a later publication aimed against Capra: *Defense against the Slanders and Deceits of Baldassare Capra.* Especially because, after demonstrating conclusively that Capra had plagiarized Galileo's (other) work, he stuck in a jibe about the ""priority in discovery"" episode. And he stuck in a jibe about the *writing style in which Capra made the accusation*:

>I do not know in what school Capra has learned these brutish manners.

The lower the stakes, the more everything matters.

(As well might also be applied re: the surprisingly vigorous modern debate over which texts in the actual *scientific* controversy over the nova were published under pen names.)

The broader context of the impact of the nova in western Europe, unsurprisingly, involves various levels of religion. In the academy, it became a flashpoint for the waning days of credible astrology, and whether mathematicians or philosophers had the better claim for explaining astronomical events.

Beyond academia, even less surprisingly, the question tended to be less ""what does it mean"" than ""where do I build my apocalypse bunker.""

Wonders in the heavens were a traditional sign of Bad Things To Come in Christian Europe. Early 1500s Augsburg, for example, witness the *Kreuzfall*--""cross-fall""--in which red and black (ash?) cross-shaped...things...fell across the land, on people, etc. This was immediately publicized as a sign of God's anger at the Augsburgers, and if they did not repent, he would send down *real*punishment. The event did not lead to ""real"" punishment, although it did lead to a woman named Anna Laminit claiming prophetic authority to interpet the *Kreuzfall*, becoming hugely famous to the extent that the emperor and empress became followers of her...until she was debunked as a fraud by, for real, the duchess of Bavaria.

But I digress because that's one of my favorite historical stories. More revelant to, you know, *the next century*: from the mid-1500s to the mid (ish)-1600s in particular (the 1400s are NOT excluded here, though), European popular pamphlets are rife with descriptions, fears, and expectations of weird things in the sky and/or astrological phenomena (alignments of the planets, and such). And these fears are centered around one thing: they all signal the coming apocalypse.

Oh, and now that we have progressed from academic pettiness to the deepest darkest places of religion, let's go to...cults?

Because yeah. The early Rosicrucian pamphlets, from 1614 and 1615, *especially* love citing 1604 as the herald or the actual dawning of a new, millennarian age. Which is not to avoid the apocalypse, but rather, to project a good time before the end.

The texts' link between the nova and the apocalypse signals its ongoing importance--either to the author of the texts actually believing in the philosophy they espoused, or to understanding how useful it could be to play on the imaginations of its audience.

Reminding one, rather, of Anna Laminit a century before, convincing the Augsburg upper class to give her a fancy house and a prime place at church...and convincing Martin Luther to visit her in search of prophecy and wisdom.

875,AskHistorians,"In ""Back to the Future III"" the protagonists modify a locomotive to reach a speed of 88 mph. What was a realistic top speed for a locomotive in 1885?","Let's look at the prototype used in the movie, sierra #3. She's a stately and handsome 4-6-0 built in 1891. Her somewhat stubby 56"" main wheels, known as ""drivers"" limited her actual top speed to 70mph. At the top end of her operational speed the valve gear barely has time to cycle steam through both sides of the steam cylinders. Often in steam locomotive design speed was limited by wheel diameter and cylinder design. I'm sure some high drivered 4-4-0 ""American"" type locomotives were capable of 88 mph in 1885. In 1893, the modified New York Central 999 pulled an express train at 102 mph. The other main limiting factor in speed in those days was track maintenance. Rich roads like the NYC, or Pennsylvania had meticulously maintained track specifically to maintain high speeds. The backwater Sierra with its hilly grade profile, historically famous sharp curves (read up on the Angels branch) and questionable track maintenance and track geometry would limit most revenue service to less than 40 if not 25 over most of the route. The steel rails themselves of the 1885 era were very spindly, often 40lb per yard, while big mainlines would have been laid with 80lb per yard steel rail. To the average reader this might not mean much, but what it means is the sturdiness of the rail dictated how much weight and lateral force you can put on the rails without them breaking gauge. 

To go down your list of questions, yes. Britain in particlar was speed obsessed. Deeper inquiry into this will reveal a speed war between the main RRs of the time. 

In 1895, the LNWR used their 2-4-0 ""Hardwicke"" to break the 90mph barrier on August 22nd 1895.

876,AskHistorians,How were people not constantly impregnated during the middle ages and renaissance with all that unprotected sex?,"*NSFW to be safe*

Let's be clear about one thing to start with: although the social history of childbirth in the later Middle Ages into the early modern era has been painted in scholarship as male professionals increasingly exerting authoritative control over women's bodies and women's rituals, pregnancy and its implications were first and foremost concerns for *women*. This is true in terms of [maternal mortality in childbirth](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3w2690/suppose_youre_giving_birth_in_1398_in_either/cxsrm98/) (scholars calculate around 1-3% per childbirth, for a lifetime risk perhaps around 10%), in terms of social stigma and legal punishment for an out of wedlock birth, in terms of financial cost (women could sue for child support, but the outcome was...uncertain, and suits could lead to their own exile *with their children*), in terms of emotional cost in case of divorce or widowhood (Italian widows returned to their father's home, but any children were the property of the dead husband's family).

I open with this because the focus on women and women's health makes the question not as straightforward as one might hope. First there is the gap between the prescriptive, Latin-based (eventually translated) academic medical tradition and practices ""on the ground."" Second, there is a [lingering and often hilarious discomfort](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/42svcr/did_the_church_have_different_standards_for_how/czdmf0z) in sources--especially from clerics--about women's sexual practices. Even as they denounce women as seductresses and temptresses, they are too scared to mention sexual practices (masturbation! lesbian sex!) outright lest they be the one to plant the idea in women's fragile, innocent minds. And third, less related to the gender, is the question of *actual* versus *perceived/hoped-for* efficacy of any birth control methods.

Whether we look at medical texts, religious instructional literature, or legal records, however, there is no doubt that just as many women longed for children and tried desperately to make that happen, many others sought the opposite.

The most basic way to prevent childbirth is obviously not to have sex, barring a certain Blessed Virgin. (I am still hoping to find, someday, a court record of a woman claiming her out-of-wedlock kid was a virgin birth). If the [early medieval penitential rules](http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/flowchart.png) on sex were taken seriously, it would not have left many opportunities for pregnancy, which is not a ""guaranteed"" thing for sure. Buuuut the general nature of later medieval literature and, by the time we start having descriptive rather than prescriptive sources about sex, court records suggest these guidelines were...guidelines at best, and maybe not even that (the penitentials are a tempermental historical source).

Still, there were definitely some women, including married ones, who created lives of post-nuptial (and sometimes post-childbirth) chastity. 13th century holy woman Marie d'Oignies and her husband opted for a celibate marriage, and 15th century inventor of autobiography Margery Kempe and her husband at least tried for it. (The confused chronology of Kempe's *Book* makes it unclear whether they succeeded completely). Also, total celibacy For All Time was not necessary. Although noble women (and sometimes men) tended to marry young--[NOT a blanket rule for the Middle Ages] (https://redd.it/3pafst)--women's age at first childbirth was frequently in the 18-20 range rather than the 13-14 one might fear.

Medical texts and court records make it clear that herbs, spices, and liquid remedies, the medicines of the Middle Ages, were a major choice when it came to birth control, Plan B, and outright abortifacients. The typical language in the sources is ""to provoke menstruation"" or ""to resume menses,"" but occasionally an author will be more explicit. 

John Riddle has done fascinating work cataloguing lists of birth control/abortion herbs referenced in ancient and medieval sources, including tracing ideas from Arabic medical literature that ends up in the Latin canon. His two big points are (1) that some of the herb combinations could possibly have had somewhat of an impact and (2) the Middle Ages, as zealously Christian as their writers could be--all university-trained physicians were at least minor clerics--were not always prudish or reticient or SIN SIN SIN about herbs that might limit childbirth, although that was frequently a background and sometimes a foreground concern.

The difficulty, of course, is extrapolating from ""lists of herbs in a 15C vernacular manual translated from a 12C Latin text carried over from a 9C Arab author."" It's easy to say vernacular puts it closer to actual practice, since women were the drivers of vernacular literacy in the later Middle Ages, but the clear lines of reference to older academic tradition make those connections somewhat questionable.

There is, however, ample court evidence to show that medical practitioners below the elite university physician level were indeed suppliers of birth control and abortifacient herbs. Anna Harding of Eichstatt is a fascinating case. She was accused of witchcraft in 1618. Legal records mention her as a provider of herbs to provoke menses (there's that language)--but that's not why she's in legal trouble! Intriguingly, Harding claimed that her potions--herbs mixed into liquid, a common type of remedy--could control menses altogether, whether that meant start, stop, reduce the flow, or even treat other conditions that might be causing the problem. (Incidentally, Harding uses herbal terms in her interrogation record, or at least the terms that are recorded, that don't match up with Riddle's lists as far as I can determine.)

Another option for birth control was sexual practices. This is a *really* touchy subject in medieval sources. In canon law and the tradition of confessor's manuals, the language can get pretty explicit. (""Ask him, if he has inserted his member into the holes in a board..."") But like the penitential referenced earlier, scholars debate whether these lists of sins for priests to ask their penitents about were actually ever used. If nothing else, they are a great guide to the celibate clerical...imagination. Yeah, definitely all in the imagination.

Ruth Mazo Karras' fantastic study of prostitution in late medieval England, on the other hand, turned up one in/famous court case that seems to suggest [sexual intercourse beyond PIV](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4cpy2c/nsfw_how_did_prostitutes_in_brothels_non_get/d1kg6sj) was an important and widely accepted means of birth control. John (!) Rykener was a cross-dressing prostitute hauled into court. He claimed that none of his customers were ever the wiser about his being male. Many interpretations take this to mean intercrural or anal intercourse, the knowledge of both of which is attested in normative religious sources.

One other option that I find fascinating is the potential use of breastfeeding as birth control. Although it's not absolute, breastfeeding can extend a woman's period of post-birth infertility. There is some evidence from both Christian and Jewish communities that some mothers sought to extend the time of breastfeeding a little bit longer than was typically prescribed. This is a particularly fruitful use of comparative Christian/Jewish studies. One of the phenomena that Elisheva Baumgarten uncovered was that, in contrast (or resulting in) statutes against Jewish and Christian women breastfeeding across religious boundaries, neighbors used to *swap off* breastfeeding duties to allow Jewish women to keep the Sabbath and Christian women to fast properly.

There was certainly plenty of ""mercenary"" wet nursing in the Middle Ages, especially in Italy and among noblewomen. Although that second group merits a, well, second glance. For war, politics, family, compatibility, and sundry reasons, it was not the most unusual of circumstances for noble wives and husbands to spend months and years apart. See, of course, the dangers of pre/extramarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which might kick the bucket further down the road rather than actually *solve* problems, but it does help explain why, given the pressures frequently on nobles to have the more offspring the better, there were so many families that had small numbers of legitimate children (even accounting for infant mortality--it's so sad to find mentions of unnamed children in chronicle accounts and letters...).

And one more point is worth mentioned. Canon (Church) law sources and the lay people who wielded them in court reflect a persistent, deep-rooted fear that (primarily) women are using magic to render men impotent. So even while the writers of romances concocted love potions for their heroes and heroines to drink, clerics had a very different obsession.

Medieval women, sometimes with the cooperation of their male partners, certainly had options when it came to attempting to prevent pregnancy. All signs suggest that many women sought to utilize them--sometimes temporarily, sometimes permanently; sometimes successfully, sometimes not so much.

877,AskHistorians,What did Rasputin actually want? What was his endgame?,"Reports are very conflicted. The police staked him out on at least one occasion, but the Empress Alexandra didn't want to hear of anything bad said about him. Nicholas seemed to go along with her wishes. After some accounts of ribaldry reached the palace, Rasputin begged the empress for forgiveness, saying that he was a sinful, imperfect man. The empress seemed to accept his apology. 

Rasputin was originally sent for when the Empress, desperate to have her son Alexei healed from his illness, allowed the *starets* (mystical man of God) to treat her son. 

Overjoyed by Rasputin's apparent healing of the tsarverich, the weak little boy on whom the dynasty relied upon, Alexandra showered him with gifts. He began wearing a silk blouse, had a personal secretary, and was given a car.  He also began making policy suggestions to Alexandra, who was filling in for Nicholas while he was away at the front, like some kind of ancient tsar-warrior leading his troops. In real life he could do little - he had only ever obtained the rank of colonel in the army, IIRC.

So was Rasputin a true, yet flawed holy man or a mere charlatan? This would depend on who you ask. Most historians do not, of course, view him positively. Few would doubt that the tsarervich did seem to get better after Rasputin saw him. (Rasputin had said that the boy should not be disturbed by doctors. Coincidentally or not, we now know that sufferers of hemophilia, young Alexei's condition, are sometimes best left alone). 

According to Prince Felix Yusopov, a close relation to the tsar and possible the richest man in tsar Russia, Rasputin had once told him, boasting of his influence on the empress: ""I'll have you made a minister if you like"" or words to that effect. However, Yusupov, who together with other nobles went on to murder Rasputin, was known for embellishing the truth, to put it mildly.

Perhaps we'll never truly know.

878,AskHistorians,"A quick cursory glance at Wikipedia shows there is a debate on the historicity of Jesus, but not Muhammad among scholars. Is this simply because there are more contemporary non-Islam records of Muhammad versus non-Christians records of Jesus?","The historicity of Muhammad is far easier to establish because of his numerous family members and companions, almost all of which are attested in later sources that supplement eachother. His son in law Ali, wife Aisha, and grandsons Hussain and Hasan for instance have all been attested in later historic sources. Contemporary inscriptions commemorating the death of Muhammad's followers such as Uthman have been found in Arabia, matching Islamic accounts. The mark Muhammad left on Arabia and the people in his environment is simply too great and coherent to be fabricated. 

The so called *hadith* (Islamic sources on sayings and actions by Muhammad) are, although in variying degrees, relatively sound historical sources because they contain virtually no supernatural allusions and have been transmitted by known chains of scholars. They contain many details about his life and character, dealings with people and even about his appearance.

Having said that however, there are few direct historical non-Islamic sources about Muhammad, and the ones that exist have doubtful origins. There is a supposed letter to Christian monks called the Ashtiname in Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai, Egypt for instance, but its autheniticity is disputed. John of Damascus, a famous Christian theologian and Church Father has written about Muhammad only several decades after his death, mentioning meeting people who met Muhammad.

I would say that in general it is very likely that Muhammad did exist, although some parts of his life are obviously not verifiable, such as his ascent to heaven and mystical transportation to Jerusalem on the 6-legged horse Burak.

As for Jesus, historiography becomes much more difficult, since the main sources for his life (the books of the New Testament and apocryphal Christian writings) are so full of supernatural references, inconsistensies and unlikely occurences that they are less useful to establish historical facts about his life. What they do provide us with however is what people transmitted and thought about Jesus life at the time.

The current historiographical consensus is that Jesus was an actual person in early 1st century Palestine, and that he was most likely killed under the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate (his governorship of the region is supported by Roman commemorative inscriptions). Further details about his life are very hard to establish, since the historicity of his followers is also contested. Although Paul most likely existed, he never physically met Jesus, and although the Book of Acts mentions Peter and the other Apostles, details are left vague and Peters fate as having been martyred in Rome is uncertain as well. Most importantly, none of them left attested writings, except perhaps Matthew and John, son of Zebedeus; who supposedly wrote a Gospel each (for obvious reasons the Gospels are not sound historical sources).

Non-Christian contemporary sources on Jesus are limited, restricted to occasional references to Jesus and Christians by historians Flavius Josephus and Tacitus.

Compare Flavius' mention of Jesus in his *Antiquities*:

> Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned:...

There are no other known contemporary non-Christian sources on Jesus except vague references in the Jewish Talmud and Mishna, which were compiled after around the year 200.

In my view, the fact that so quickly after his death, Jesus' life was mythologized (Jesus probably died about 30 CE, the first Gospel, that of Mark, may have been composed as early as 65 CE), shows that Jesus ministry was probably short and shrouded in mystery, but left a profound impact on his followers because of his charisma, message, and probably his eloquence. It also indicates that his following was most likely predominantly illiterate and uneducated, since no known sources that were written during his life exist. Nonetheless, his following spread very quickly over geographical distances, since Paul writes to Christian communities ranging from Rome to Greece, Asia Minor and Palestine. It seems to me unlikely that a religious movement with such momentum and based on following a certain person **wasn't** inspired by a real life historical charismatic leader figure.

Source: am student of religious studies :)

**Edit:** I want to add furthermore, that Islamic sources on Jesus are obviously also not very useful to verify historical facts about his life, because they are mostly restricted to the Quran and the *hadith*, and most likely used earlier Christian and Christian Gnostic sources as reference material. The story in the Quran of a young Jesus forging birds out of clay/mud and breathing life in to them is als found in the apocryphal (Gnostic) Gospel of Thomas for instance.

**Edit 2:** I see now that I may have slightly overstated the historical reliability of the hadith. Although I still stand by my view that they are more useful for determining details about Muhammad as a person, I realize there are several ""but's"" (like some people have rightly pointed out), such as the time they were written in and ideological/religious reasons for keeping, editing or discarding hadith.

(http://gnosis.org/naghamm/gosthom.html)

**Edit 3**: here are 2 titles about the development of early christianity which are excellent and also provide valuable insights in the person of Jesus as opposed to the Christian conception of Jesus:

* Henry Chadwick - *The Early Church*
* Diarmaid McCullough - *A History of Christianity*

McCullough is the most comprehensive introduction to Christianity I have read so far, I would recommend it to everyone. The first chapters especially deal with the historical context of Jesus' surroundings. Chadwick is perhaps a bit more of an old fashioned scholar, but his knowledge and use of primary sources is unmatched and he analyzes church history with English precision. Both great reads."
879,AskHistorians,What purpose does Month/Day/Year do when the rest of the world does Day/Month/Year? Why/when was the shift in the US?,"Before any other answer is given, it must be noted that there is a severe problem with the premises, i.e., that the US changed. In reality, the US stayed the same while the rest of the English speaking world changed. We can see this both in real-life letters and in the fictional letters of epistolary novels.

For example, in the first North American novel *The History of Emily Montague* (1769) by Emily Brooke, we see the familiar ""American"" format of Month/Day/Year; however, we also see the same format in British sources at least through the first half of the nineteenth century. Lord Byron (died 1824) dated all his letters in the ""American"" format, and his acquaintance Mary Shelley used the ""American"" format in the letters in *Frankenstein* (1818). Anne Brontë's *The Tenant of Wildfell Hall* (1848), an epistolary novel, also uses the ""American"" format. Wilkie Collins uses the ""American"" format in the *Woman in White* (1859); however, in the later work *The Moonstone* (1868), he uses the ""American"" format for the dates at the top of the letters but uses the ""British"" format when mentioning dates in the body of such letters. By 1897, we see in Bram Stoker's *Dracula* that the ""British"" format is used throughout Jonathan's diary."
880,AskHistorians,[Les Misérables] Was Jean Valjean's punishment of 19 years of prison and forced labor for stealing a loaf of bread (and his subsequent escape attempts) an accurate punishment for that crime in that time period? Or was it exaggerated in the book/play?,"Jean Valjean was sentenced according to the French Penal Code of 1810 (you can find an English translation [here](https://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/france/penalcode/c_penalcode1.html)) which is often confused with the much more famous Code Napoleon; a law code which did not deal with criminal offenses.

The penal code contains the following:

>Whoever has fraudulently abstracted a thing which does not belong to him, is guilty of theft.

and;

>The **penalty of death** shall be inflicted upon the individuals guilty of theft, committed with the aggravation of all the five circumstances following:  
>  
>   1st. If the theft has been committed by night;  
>  
>   2d. If the theft has been committed by two or more persons;  
>  
>   3d. If the criminals, or any of them, were in possession of arms, apparent or concealed;  
>  
>   4th. If they have committed the crime;  
>  
>Either by means of extend house-breaking (*effraction exterieure*), or of scaling, or of false keys, in a house, apartment, chamber, or lodgings, inhabited or used for habitation, or their appurtenances;  
>  
>Or by assuming the title of a public functionary, or civil or military officer, or dressed in the uniform or costume of such functionary, or officer, or by alleging a false order of the civil or military authority.  
>  
>5th. If they have committed the crime with violence, or threats of making use of their arms.

and;

>The **penalty of perpetual hard labour** shall be inflicted upon every individual guilty of theft, committed by means of violence, and, moreover, **with any two of the first four circumstances** enumerated in the preceding article.  
>  
>If the violence, with which the theft has been committed, has left marks of wounds or bruises, this circumstance alone shall suffice, that the penalty of perpetual hard labour shall be awarded.

Compare this to how Victor Hugo describes Valjeans crime:

&#x200B;

>One Sunday evening, Maubert Isabeau, the baker on the Church Square at Faverolles, was preparing to go to bed, when he heard a violent blow on the grated front of his shop. He arrived in time to see an arm passed through a hole made by a blow from a fist, through the grating and the glass. The arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off. Isabeau ran out in haste; the robber fled at the full speed of his legs. Isabeau ran after him and stopped him. The thief had flung away the loaf, but his arm was still bleeding. It was Jean Valjean.  
>  
>This took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunals of the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at night. He had a gun which he used better than anyone else in the world, he was a bit of a poacher, and this injured his case.  
>  
>(...)  
>  
>Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty. The terms of the Code were explicit. There occur formidable hours in our civilization; there are moments when the penal laws decree a shipwreck. What an ominous minute is that in which society draws back and consummates the irreparable abandonment of a sentient being! Jean Valjean was condemned to five years in the galleys.

So by committing his crime in the first place and doing so by night (or rather in the evening, but it being considered night by the judge),  Jean Valjean had already made sure he would be sentenced to hard labour.

Of course, he was not sentenced to 19 years (he initially got a 'mere' 5 years) but his escape attempts prolonged his sentence; as Hugo writes:

&#x200B;

>Towards the end of this fourth year Jean Valjean’s turn to escape arrived. His comrades assisted him, as is the custom in that sad place. He escaped. He wandered for two days in the fields at liberty, if being at liberty is to be hunted, to turn the head every instant, to quake at the slightest noise, to be afraid of everything,—of a smoking roof, of a passing man, of a barking dog, of a galloping horse, of a striking clock, of the day because one can see, of the night because one cannot see, of the highway, of the path, of a bush, of sleep. On the evening of the second day he was captured. He had neither eaten nor slept for thirty-six hours. The maritime tribunal condemned him, for this crime, to a prolongation of his term for three years, which made eight years. In the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again; he availed himself of it, but could not accomplish his flight fully. He was missing at roll-call. The cannon were fired, and at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction; he resisted the galley guards who seized him. Escape and rebellion. This case, provided for by a special code, was punished by an addition of five years, two of them in the double chain. Thirteen years. In the tenth year his turn came round again; he again profited by it; he succeeded no better. Three years for this fresh attempt. Sixteen years. Finally, I think it was during his thirteenth year, he made a last attempt, and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of four hours of absence. Three years for those four hours. Nineteen years.

The case of Jean Valjean is of course also a social criticism by the author directed against that very justice system. Indeed, Victor Hugo claimed to have witnessed a starving young man being led away by police with a loaf of bread under his arm in 1846 as he was writing Les Miserables,  which Hugo did not perceive as a sign of criminality but rather of hopeless poverty. Hugo himself makes it very clear that he considered the 19 year sentence to be absurd, writing:

>In October, 1815, he was released; he had entered there in 1796, for having broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread.

So in summary, yes hard labour was indeed a common punishment for theft in early 19th century France. Nevertheless, Jean Valjeans predicament (while possible) would have been an exceptional case.

**Edit:** By using the penal code of 1810, Hugo introduced an anachronism into the story. Had he used the contemporary French Penal Code of 1791, Valjean would have received 12 years ""in irons"" for the crime of theft/burglary alone"
881,AskHistorians,I'm a mid-late 19th century urban teenager and I'm feeling rebellious. My parents are squares and 'the man' is keeping me down. What are my outlets? What am I wearing? Where do I go to find like minded people? Do I have music? Alcohol or drugs?,"The custom of rebellious youth banding together and identifying as a group with shared tastes in music and dress is very much a twentieth century (and obviously later) phenomenon that arose in the post-World War II days. The flapper was not a subcultural figure, as she's commonly represented - I explained [the public reaction to bobbed hair](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a8jv6s/bob_haircuts_on_women_in_1920s_america/ecc3l35/) in this answer, and wrote [more about the flapper](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7du6r7/did_flappers_use_birth_control/dq0z9bs/) in this other - but simply a term for teenage girls and young women who followed current mainstream fashion, sometimes with other baggage attached and sometimes not. They were certainly aware, before that point, that adolescents could be ~~annoying~~ rebellious, but teens didn't have a high level of independence, musical mass media was restricted to purchasing sheet music, and clothing was quite expensive. Participation in countercultures was generally restricted to adults and tended to focus on art and philosophy - they were often writers and artists raised in the middle or upper classes who didn't live by the normal conventions of those classes, having indiscreet affairs and wearing eccentric clothes. As such, these groups weren't really what you're looking for.

But as I said, teenagers could engage in bad behavior, particularly in urban situations. From the Early Modern Era and likely before, the behavior of (typically male) apprentices was known for being disruptive. In some cases, this came from ill-treatment by their masters: many were underfed, which could lead to stealing food, and physical abuse, which might cause other forms of acting out, was not uncommon. Even when apprentices were treated well and paid a small stipend, though, they might engage in violent contests like cock-throwing (throwing rocks at a rooster to knock it over long enough for the thrower to run over and grab it) and football, as well as less troubling but still disruptive games like skittles and quoits, and for gambling, drinking, and breaking windows. By the late nineteenth century, apprenticeships had mostly fallen out of use - but young employees were tempted to similar kinds of disruptive behavior when they got the chance. Teenage boys at work in the city had ample opportunity to gamble, to drink and smoke, and to haze each other, in contravention to the expectations adults had for them to be responsible and obedient employees. Misbehavior in working-class girls, on the other hand, was typically viewed through the lens of sexuality in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The word ""delinquent"", when used for a girl, pretty much always indicated a teenager who was engaging in premarital sex. This sex was often at least casually transactional, the old idea that a date should be rewarded for paying for food, drink, and entertainment, and was viewed as the next thing to prostitution by reformers. I have two past answers relating to this: [on ice cream parlors](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/71fc3d/ice_cream_parlour_code_for_something_in_1900s/dnb56ci/) and [on the origins of dating culture](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7anfdx/what_did_guys_do_to_express_interest_in_women/dpbhtzi/).

But the most important teenage rebellion of all relates to something much less salacious: education. Ensuring that they got an education could be a serious rebellion for girls at any level of the social scale, both if their parents didn't want them to be educated or if they considered the issue from the wider perspective in which society in general didn't care about anything but their obedience and submission. This is often overlooked when envisioning what historical rebellion could look like, because today all teenagers in the US and UK are required to go to school up to a certain point, so rebelling *against* education is an easier thing to visualize. But for so many teenage girls of the late Victorian era, persisting in learning academic subjects was a potent form of subversive behavior. Emma Goldman grew up in Prussia and Russia, but her story is a helpful illustration: she fought against unsympathetic teachers to actually learn, and when she was forced to leave school and start working to help make up for her father's lack of success in business, she continued to teach herself by reading on her own. Authorities felt that working-class girls should mainly learn household skills in order to get jobs as servants or to keep their future families clean, and middle- and upper-class girls were largely not supposed to learn anything seriously academic, even once being an educated mother became an aspect of feminine virtue. Even some female educators were adamant about only teaching their pupils to fit them for responsible, intelligent motherhood. Beyond the value of intellectual pursuits in and of themselves, education offered the opportunity of teaching and therefore self-support, which was fairly radical as a career rather than a brief job before marriage."
882,AskHistorians,"In the Netflix series ""Godless"", we meet a family of Norwegians all the way out in the American frontier in the 1800s. What would make a family from so far away go to such a far distance, especially in such an unbuilt land?","Hi,

This is by no means an area I am an expert in. However, that being said, I will attempt to answer in general about European immigration to the United States in the 19th century because I've been teaching subjects like this for nearly a decade. This answer is general and wide-ranging and not an in-depth look at Norwegians as immigrants, per se. Think of it as a Freshman-level survey lecture. One final disclaimer that, I think, fits with any question about historical motivations and actions; ""It's complicated.""

With those out of the way, let's delve a little into the phenomena of American migration and the immigrant story as a whole:

* Immigration to the United States was the product of ""boosterism""

Basically, both officials from the US government and citizens alike 'sold' life in the United States as a golden opportunity. Mind you, this was not unique to the United States itself; the [British government used to advertise owning farms and land and opportunity in Canada] (http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/e/e350/e008748903-v8.jpg) to the swelling populations of the 19th century. In fact, some have argued that ['transportation'] (http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/convicts-and-the-british-colonies) to Australia was also a release valve for excess population. Essentially, there was a wide-ranging 'sales' pitch to draw Europeans (and Asians) to ""The West"" (a vague, wide term that includes many places we would not think of as 'western' today.) 

A good example of this sales pitch, though coming at the tail end of the 19th century, is the adventuresome [""dime novels""] (https://blogs.baylor.edu/texascollection/2013/08/13/dime-novels-the-rise-of-the-american-hero/) which, tall tales aside, painted the West as an empty land ready for exploitation. Newspaper reporters and fiction writers alike jumped upon the bandwagon of these tales because appetite for them in Europe pretty much guaranteed newspaper sales (and writers' incomes). Moreover, and perhaps more famously, [""Buffalo Bill's Wild West Shows""] (https://centerofthewest.org/learn/western-essays/wild-west-shows/) romanticized America to the European market; America was a place where a man could prove his manliness through near-mythical deeds! He was immensely popular and his act performed for Queen Victoria and the Pope by the end of the 19th century. 

Can't imagine getting swept up in the fever of a new land? Well, imagine if a newssite broke the story of a previously-unknown continent that was 'empty' and ready for settling. A place where you could start a new life with a new name and a new identity. How many 21st century Americans themselves would leap at the chance to abandon debt, shitty credit scores, acrimonious politics, social inequality, economic disparity, and the banal evils of corporate life for an opportunity for adventure and excitement?

Add to this stories of immigrants who 'made it' in the USA - people like [Levi Strauss] (https://www.biography.com/people/levi-strauss-9496989), [Andrew Carnegie] (https://www.biography.com/people/andrew-carnegie-9238756), and [Adolphus Busch] (https://shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/b/busch/) - and you have a powerful incentive to risk literally everything in a voyage to the USA and traversing unknown regions of a dangerous continent.

* Free land/cheap land is better than expensive land/hereditary land.

Unlike Europe, the Canadian/American West had lots of 'unused' land, according to boosters (please know it certianly wasn't ""empty"" nor ""unused"" but that's a different conversation). This goes hand-in-hand with the above point; it was a tradition in North America to offer cheap or free land to entice Europeans over to the New World, but these (such as the Headright acts in 1600s Virginia) were met with mixed results. The difference between 1600 and 1800 boils down to changes in agriculture and medicine in Europe which led to higher populations and over-crowding of the land and cities. This, in turn, led to high land and property prices (as well as taxes) for new families, meaning many people's dreams of having their own farm/land/business would always be a 'dream.'

Comparatively, the US government offered free land periodically through things like the Homestead Act of 1862 which opened up millions of acres of land for a pittance in order to get European (read ""White Europeans"" from North and West Europe) and American presences in the region; this would lead to settled farmers producing food and forcing out the Native Americans whose land it really was (though the US gov't conveniently neglected to tell Europeans as such). About 1.5 million homesteaders, not all of whom were US citizens by birth, took up the offer of free or nearly-free land during the lifetime of the Act and its 'spin offs' (smaller, more regional acts that hoped to have the same draw) continued well into the 20th century, drawing people to places like Nebraska. Best of all, taxes - if they existed at all in the region - were miniscule compared to Europe. Free land and no taxes? Sign me up, right?

So, Europeans had a choice; stay and maybe scrape enough together to maybe afford some land or sell pretty much everything and take a gamble on snagging some 'free' land.

* Europeans were politically convulsed

While not quite as applicable to Scandinavians, most of Europe at the time was going through some pretty scary political, social, and economic upheavals that made staying in Europe in the mid-19th century particularly dicey. German, Italian, Irish, Polish, and many other Europeans were faced with [political revolution, unemployment, and literal starvation] (http://www.ushistory.org/us/25f.asp) in the mid-19th century. The option then was to stay and maybe die or to take a gamble and maybe live. A good example is the Potato Blight which most famously affected the Irish (leading to over half the population dying or fleeing to foreign shores), but Germany and Belgium were also affected deeply, especially the poor and working class whose diet was extremely dependent upon the humble spud. Comparatively, with the exception of 1860 to 1865, the United States seemed relatively stable and prosperous.

Stay and die or move and live (probably)? Which would you choose?

* Relatives and community were already here in some cases.

Only a relative few immigrants 'blazed the trail' so to speak. Many were enticed to come to the USA by relatives and friends who had gone before. Immigrant communities - speaking their mother tongue primarily (or exclusively) - were common in the ""West."" Many frontier cities had newspapers and laws passed in the mother tongue, despite being in the USA. Why? Comfort and familiarity. Immigrants banded together in order to look out for each other and provide a sense of continuity and 'normalcy' to their new lives. Larger communities drew more people and made possible more success stories. Usually, more immigrants settled relatively stable areas and only the truly desperate or foolhardy settled 'frontiers.'

I like your term ""unbuilt""; the immigrant experience allows the newcomer to craft a world closer to their liking. It gave immigrants agency in crafting their future; a world that had all the good stuff of the homeland and all the stuff they liked about the new place. This is something they could never really have done even in the most liberal of European countries. Interestingly, the act of ""building"" reinforced cooperation and community while, ironically, perpetuating the myth of rugged individualism and made the transition from settled Europe to 'unbuilt' USA more palatable and less scary.

In conclusion, there are a LOT of reasons why a Norwegian would come out to the badlands of the West and persevere in the face of such hardships. But a combination of sales pitch, free land, a desire to remake the world as you see fit, and the lure of 'making it' all combine into a rather powerful impulse to ""go to such a far distance.""

883,AskHistorians,"Bill Clinton has often said that his greatest foreign policy failure was inaction during the Rwandan Genocide. But at the time, was there any domestic pressure calling for US intervention or public debate about whether the US should intervene?","There was hesitation, both political and institutional, to get involved in another civil war in Africa after the optics of the Battle of Mogadishu in October 1993 (aka Blackhawk Down). The perceived failure of the UNOSOM missions and the graphic destruction of US military forces (broadcast 24 hours/day by CNN, who learned much about American media appetites in the first Gulf War) by what amounted to a well-armed mob, was a black eye for humanitarian actions in the region.  Walter Clark, the (I believe) deputy special envoy to Somalia, was quoted as saying ""The ghosts of Somalia continue to haunt US policy. Our lack of response in Rwanda was a fear of getting involved in something like a Somalia all over again.""  

The immediate post Cold War period in American foreign policy saw us involved in a number of humanitarian interventions, several of which were perceived as spectacular failures; the inability of UN peacekeeping forces (often with heavy US involvement) to deter high-profile horrors like the Srebernica massacre (former Yugoslavia) brought fashionable ideas like the responsibility to protect into question.  The truth was that most of those operations were actually getting the job done - the huge contingent of US Marines supporting the UNISOM mission in Somalia was quite effective in restoring order, for instance, and Bosnia and Serbia were effectively sorted out (Richard Holbrooke wrote a great book detailing that peace process). The optics were a problem, though. 

Oddly, in some ways the US fell victim to its own success; our sweeping coalition victory in Iraq in 1991 set an unreasonable expectation for the effectiveness of military force as a means for intervention, created undue faith in multilateral coalition building, and also empowered those who supported military intervention in non-warfighting roles. While that method of deployment wasn't exactly new, it was used in the post Cold War world with a newfound vigor and frequency, the possible side effects of a military that quite suddenly found itself without a pole star (no more Soviets, no more mission).

Memories of Vietnam, contrasted with the incredible success of Gulf War I left the American public and politicians with a distaste for quagmires.  American involvement in Somalia was too short and ineffective; once the Marines bugged out, the UN peacekeeping forces lost their teeth and the region began to destabilize. For all their effectiveness as combatants (seriously, don't go to war with America), the Rangers, Deltas, and SOAR assets left behind to capture Mohammed Farah Aidid were too small and too bound by ROE to give any bite to the peacekeeping forces still in place.  I mean, it's no wonder something like the Battle of Mogadishu transpired; wrong forces, wrong political ideas, bad raid planning and some bad luck created a perfect storm, and ultimately Rwanda would suffer as a result.

884,AskHistorians,"It's 1900 or so, and I'm a ""proper,"" accredited historian with a thorough education and an extensive knowledge of the sources available to me. What's the biggest misconception I have about the past, from a modern perspective?","Would a historian back then also have huge differences from us in terms of what archaeological data he had? I know technology played a big role in terms of our gaining raw data about ancient history, but I don't know what was discovered then. How big would the gap between our understanding of ancient cultures and the 1900 historian's be?"
885,AskHistorians,"In the U.S., why are ""ethnic"" eateries for immigrants such as the Irish, Dutch, or Swedish underrepresented despite their significant share of the population, whereas the cuisines of other groups, such as Italians, Japanese, Cuban, Ethiopian, among others, are more prominent?","I don't have the background to address the others, but I can shed a little light on why two seemingly contradictory things happened with the Irish in America:

 - a). They form a notable part of American culinary history, despite:
 - b). Irish cuisine having virtually no significant representation in America's restaurants

And the answer is surprisingly simple: **Immigrant groups aren't necessarily a representative cross-section of their original societies.** In fact, they almost *never* are.

**WELL ACTUALLY #1:** If you want to be *really* fastidious -- or pedantic -- you can argue that the downfall of Irish cuisine in America begins in the early 17th century when James I annexes Ireland, and accelerates after Cromwell's conquest in 1649-1653. The advancing English control over Ireland is what sets the stage for all the stuff we're going to talk about here. The Irish diet suffered terribly and didn't recover until the 20th century. However, I don't know as much about this period as I'd like, so I'm dropping it here only so you can have a sniffy little WELL ACTUALLY moment at a cocktail party if the subject ever comes up. I live for this shit, which is why no one invites me to parties anymore. (Win-win!)

**WELL ACTUALLY #2:** The Irish who emigrated to the U.S. overwhelmingly did so over the course of the 19th century, with numbers peaking in the 1840s and 1850s. If these dates sound vaguely familiar, it's because Ireland's Great Famine -- and more broadly, [the circumstances that created it](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2zqz3z/i_often_hear_people_say_that_the_irish_potato/cplvaxl/) -- drove massive numbers of people out of the country on top of the ~1 million it killed within it. Despite popular belief, the potato blight started the famine but *didn't actually cause it*. I'll reserve further comment because that's not the focus of this post, but it's almost impossible to exaggerate how much Ireland and its trajectory as a country and culture has been changed by the famine. Its population still hasn't recovered more than 170 years later.

So let's get to your actual question. Writing anything that's universally true about a mass migration is a fool's errand, but the following is pretty reliably true of Irish immigrants to the U.S. in the mid- to late 19th century:

 - **Poor:** Not shocking. There weren't a whole lot of people hitting the beach at Ellis Island who were more concerned about haute cuisine than just getting something vaguely edible on the table.
 - **Young and single:** While this was true of most immigrants irrespective of background, it was notable in the Irish migration, especially in the years during and after the famine. For many Irish households, the only way to ensure the family's survival (or at least increase the odds of it) was to send teenagers and young adults to America to fend for themselves. If Junior made enough money to bring a family member over, it was typically a sibling who'd come, and not Mom or Dad. As Jane Ziegelman notes in *97 Orchard: An Edible History of Five Immigrant Families in One New York Tenement*, the Germans, Italians, and Russians were more likely to emigrate as intact families and with neighbors from the same town. They effectively provided themselves with an extended support network and greater protection against social predators and bad luck in America. (Don't believe misty-eyed depictions of the American immigrant experience ... there was a lot of both.)
 - **Female:** This was unusual, though I believe Irish migration was simply majority female rather than being overwhelmingly female (again, more true of the years during and after the famine). New York City had an insatiable demand for domestic service workers in the mid- to late 19th century, and young Irish women in steerage on the Liverpool-NYC line were a major source of it.
 - **Not well-exposed to a wide variety of ingredients:** Aaaaaaand here's poverty again. The quickest example I can point to is how beef and pork were regarded by Irish immigrants. Ireland produced a lot of high-quality beef, but did so almost entirely for the export market (and toward the end of the 19th century, the English military). The average Irish family couldn't afford to buy the finished product, or a calf to raise on its own, or had the pasture land for it anyway. By contrast, raising a pig on kitchen scraps was generally within the means of most families. Bacon and cabbage was a traditional Irish meal, with the bacon (more specifically, the fat rendered from it) not being the dominant ingredient but crucial to flavoring the rest of the dish. Hilariously, when Americans eat the ""traditional"" corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick's Day, they're eating what was effectively a form of revenge that Irish-Americans took on the deprivation of their past lives. Irish-Americans in the U.S. had far better access to the ""prestige"" meat that was beef, and by God, they were not going to eat fucking bacon and cabbage on a celebratory occasion. It's a vivid reminder that what trickles down to us as ""tradition"" in immigrant foodways is often less a reflection of the old country and more a reflection of what immigrants went nuts eating once they had the opportunity. Similarly, a lot of Italian-American families venerate the tradition of the Sunday *sugo* without knowing that cooking a sauce full of meat would have been beyond the wildest dreams of the average Italian peasant. As a matter of fact, their forebears would be horror-stricken at the idea of tossing so much meat into a single meal.
 - **A smaller factor related to the above:** Ireland's climate (rainy and cool) didn't permit the sheer variety of grain and vegetable types that were more common in European countries of more southerly latitudes. And -- again -- because the Irish population was largely in a state of cyclic poverty, Ireland as a whole saw few food imports within the means of the general population. 
 - **Equally under-exposed to the best quality ingredients:** The absentee English landlords who largely controlled Ireland's farms and pastures reserved the country's best produce for export. Yes, Ireland was exporting food even during the famine. Yes, ships full of beef, mutton, grain, milk, cheese, and butter sailed out of an island full of starving people. Yes, people were appalled by it even at the time. (Regrettably, this outrage was not immediately shared by Parliament.)

As with [the Finnish immigrants](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9ohvp7/in_the_us_why_are_ethnic_eateries_for_immigrants/e7upxhj/) that /u/sunagainstgold references above, it was very common for Irish women to make a living as cooks after arriving in America. This seems a little counterintuitive given the list we've just run through, and if the New Yorkers of the period were a little more self-aware and a little less desperate for servants, they might have agreed.  (""Sure, let's hire the girl from the island full of starving people whose traditional cuisine was destroyed by two centuries of repressive imperial control. I bet Bridget makes a mean *coquilles St.-Jacques.*"")

**So how did beginner Irish cooks fare?** About as well as you'd expect. Irish cooks were a common joke in the middle- and upper-class households of New York City. Housewives complained that they didn't know how to make anything that wasn't tea, potatoes, bacon, or cabbage. If you were lucky, they knew how to make an insipid stew. Most of them were from rural areas in Ireland and had never cooked over anything that wasn't a peat fire. They were flummoxed by coal stoves. They had no idea how to use modern cookware and broke things constantly. Anything that wasn't boiled was going to be burned. They couldn't make coffee or little pastries to serve with it, or anything else appropriate to serve for a guest luncheon. With the distance of years, we have the compassion to see that these women were likely doing their best in an impossible set of circumstances. The housewives of the time simply thought the Irish cook was a plague on the city.

**Though in one case, this was literally true:** The most famous Irish cook of the period is indisputably Mary Mallon, who arrived in the U.S. in 1884 and would later become known as ""Typhoid Mary"" after infecting dozens of people. She was an asymptomatic carrier of the *salmonella typhi* bacteria and, um, not the world's greatest hand-washer. A researcher named George Soper spent a significant portion of his professional career chasing her from outbreak to outbreak. The story is both fascinating and tragic, but this is getting long.

So at the individual level, it's pretty clear why few Irish arrived in America with the background and knowledge to cook professionally. If you zoom out a bit and look at the population as a whole, it becomes equally apparent why the whole historical miasma -- *everything* that circled around the Irish immigrant population, from centuries of English repression, the loss of Ireland's traditional cuisine, the circumstances that led so many to flee Ireland, the lack of capital and risk protection in America, to the lack of support from extended family networks -- was so unlikely to result in ""Irish restaurants"" becoming a thing. 

Ziegelman summarizes it better than I can:

*No other immigrant arrived in the United States with a culinary tradition as skeletal as the Irish. By the time of the Great Famine, three centuries of the landlord system had stripped it down to a single carbohydrate and a handful of condiments. Where Germans and Italians and Jews worked hard to perpetuate native food ways, the Irish peasant had little to preserve.*

**TL:DR: Oliver Cromwell doesn't care about Irish people.**

886,AskHistorians,"Transvestism and especially ""Ladyboys"" are strongly associated with South-East and East Asian culture and cities like Bangkok and Tokyo. When did this trope start and how old is it?","Michael Peletz’s book *Gender Pluralism in Southeast Asia since Early Modern Times* is basically tailor-made to answer your question. 

While staying very focused on the trail of evidence specific to each society/state he investigates (some from the Austronesian islands and then Burma and Thailand from mainland southeast Asia), Peletz agrees with earlier scholarship that shared geographic/climatological context and millennia of contact among themselves and with “fringe” states (India, China, Japan) have led to a certain porousness of cultural features even amidst awesome diversity. Practices of and attitudes towards gender pluralism are one of the most interesting areas to compare and contrast. Examining Southeast Asia as a region of individual societies is especially useful for this thread because pre/early 20th century Thailand is very under-studied with respect to gender and sexuality.

Peletz discusses gender pluralism in southeast Asian societies in several successive stages: pre/early-European contact (through the early 20th century); the era of state formation and European colonialism (18th-20th centuries); and globalization/entrenchment of capitalism and European-style modernity (mid-20th century). For the earliest stage, it’s important to be aware, many of his sources are 19th/early 20th-century European travelers and ethnographers. (There is additional material from several of the states and Portuguese, especially, explorers going back to the 14th and 16th centuries respectively). However, through comparisions among societies and by examining both change and continuity over the late 19th to mid-20th century sources, Peletz says he is confident that he can discuss genuinely “early modern” gender pluralism.

The most important clarification to make is that we are primarily talking about *gender* here, not sexuality or sexual orientation. Tamara Loos makes this point much more strongly than Peletz, but I think it’s an important one. The early modern and modern West foregrounds sexuality and emphasizes hetero-*sexual* relations as the central axis of gender/sexuality; early modern Southeast Asian societies focused on hetero-*gender* (and cisgender) lifestyle and relationships.

In early modern Southeast Asian societies, ideas of gender arose out of/with a cosmological concept of the gendered sacred: the divine encompassed both female and male (and agender, in some origin myths). That is to say, there was real power in both female and male/femininity and masculinity. Our information about gender pluralism comes mostly from a religious context, in fact. The Bugis of South Sulawesi provide the best-known example of the most common form of gender pluralism. One class of their sacral priesthood is called the *bissu*. In the early modern era—it’s attested by both Sulawesi and Portuguese sources from the 16th century on—the *bissu* included normatively gendered female-assigned priests as well as male-assigned priests who *reassigned* themselves as cisgender female. 

In a hybrid local belief system with elements of Islam, Buddhism, and indigenous Austronesian religion, the *bissu* served as royal priests and guardians of their sacred texts. Transgender *bissu* adopted normatively-female clothing and mannerisms. They also set themselves up as women in society—most critically, as wives. European writers made the immediate leap to sex, denouncing the trans *bissu* as sodomites. My point here isn’t to say whether or not homo-*sexual* relationships occurred in any given hetero-*gender* couple; the point is that for the early modern Bugis, that question was, well, beside the point.

While the *bissu* and their counterparts were permanent, lifelong transitions, it’s interesting to observe temporary transgender adoption as well. In 19th century Aceh, there were competitions of religious and literary knowledge between teams from mosques and madrasas from neighboring villages. A key player on each team was the *sadati*--a “dancing boy” who adopted the dress and manner of a young woman for the course of the contest. European ethnographers documented homo-sexual relations among the members of a given team; interestingly, this included both homo-gender and hetero-gender relationships.

I’ve concentrated on the Bugis out of Peletz’s examples because there is also documented, accepted gender-crossing outside a religious context. Both *calabai* (men reassigned as women) and—somewhat unusually--*calatai* (women reassigned as men) crossed the gender boundary for the duration of their lives. Grandiose-minded imperialist James Brook in 1848 noted:

> The strangest custom I observed is, that some men dress like women, and
some women like men; not occasionally, but all their lives, devoting themselves to the occupations and pursuits of their adopted sex. In the case of
the males, it seems that the parents of a boy, upon perceiving in him certain
effeminacies of habit and appearance, are induced thereby to present him
to one of the rajahs, by whom he is received.

The really interesting thing to me is that despite the insinuations we might read into this, Brook is careful to distance this gender transgression from sexual transgression: becoming a calabai does not mean one engages in homosexual behavior. Now, he’s making a point about what he sees as the horrors of the Ottoman Empire as much as promoting the Bugis here, so I’m not sure how far we should take that part at face value. What’s more interesting, especially given the existence of calatai as well as calabai, is Brooks’ recognition of an overall good status for women in Bugis society. He is particularly impressed by women’s roles in government and the lack of prostitution.

Our self-appointed white rajah (no, really) isn’t the only one concerned with prostitution in relation to gender and gender pluralism. In the later chapters of his book, Peletz turns to the reasons for Southeast Asia’s mid-20th century shift towards opprobrium against homosexuality that partially brought gender-crossing down with it. One of the biggest causes he finds is a marked drop in the status of women and femininity. The commodification of sex into prostitution, including through Western military presence and sex tourism, might give some individual women a sense of empowerment over their own circumstances but has *overall* helped drive the objectification of women. While the *bissu* and counterparts found increased sacred power in blending their born-maleness with lived-femaleness, the power of femaleness declined markedly.

The changing role of religion in Austronesian and peninsular societies, too, has played a factor. The more organic and cosmological rooting of spirituality has been overwritten by the “rationalization” of beliefs (expressed as doctrine/facts to learn).

And finally, as in the West, political centralization, state formation, and the rise of capitalism were powered by the drive for rigidity, order, social stratification, *normativity*. 

But most important, Peletz stresses, these processes have by no means been complete. The work of individual activists as well as the dyed-in inheritance from centuries or millennia of gender pluralism have helped modern southeast Asian cultures maintain at least an ambivalence towards trans people and culture in the face of military dictatorship, outside imperialism, and religious fundamentalism.

888,AskHistorians,"The Orthodox Church considers itself to be catholic. The Catholic Church considers itself to be orthodox. Why did ""Catholic"" and ""Orthodox"" become the names of the two churches after the schism of 1054?","I just finished a 23-hour drive (straight), so bear with me as I sort through these terms for you, which have meanings beyond their being titles. 

It's important to understand that the words ""catholic"" and ""orthodox"" have general meanings as words outside a religious connotation which eventually came to be associated with religion, particular meanings when applied to the Christian faith, and now an additional special meaning as titles of the Churches they're called. You are correct in that both (what are known as) the Catholic and Orthodox Churches both claim to be at once catholic and orthodox in their particular senses, while being called apart from one another, respectively, Catholic and Orthodox. *Generally*, you'll know the sense they're being used in simply by whether they're capitalized - if they get the big ""C"" and ""O"" they're referring as titles to the Churches proper, and if they get the little ""c"" and ""o"" they're referring to the trait which both Churches claim. 

Outside this use of the terms ""orthodox"" and ""catholic"" however, it's *also* important to understand that the word ""Church"" *also* has a particular meaning within Christian history and to both the Catholic and Orthodox Churches: whereas the word ""church"" can mean a building designated for religious worship and/or an assembly of the faithful, when applied within Catholicism and Orthodoxy in a particular sense it designates a body of the faithful who profess a common faith (e.g. the Nicene Creed) and who are united under a validly ordained and lawfully governing bishop. Thus the Catholic Church and Orthodox Church are more than simply a monolithic structure: they're vast organizations comprised of many smaller, autonomous-and-unique-but-nevertheless-united bodies spread throughout the world. The Catholic Church is not, for example, one blob headed by the bishop of Rome (the pope), but many independent particular Churches headed by their bishops who are all in communion with one another and at Rome. The majority of these belong to what's known as the Roman Rite, but there are also those which belong to the Greek (Byzantine) Rite, the Coptic Rite, the Maronite Rite, and so on. In the same way, the Orthodox Church is not one blob headed by the Patriarch of Constantinople, but many independent particular Churches headed by bishops, and so forth. 

This plays into your question, because when you dig into the history of the terms themselves, they are used in their general sense before being applied to either Catholicism or Orthodoxy in their particular or special sense, and when they are used in this sense they refer to the Churches as constituted in that way. 

So, what did they mean originally, and when did they start to be applied in a uniquely Christian sense, and then, eventually, as a special titular term describing both the Catholic and Orthodox Churches proper: 

The word *catholic* derives from the Greek *katholikos*, which has a generally simple meaning of ""universal"" or ""of the whole."" While it doesn't originally find its origin in Christianity, it was used to definitively describe apostolic Christianity (which both the Catholic and Orthodox Churches stake claim to through lines of apostolic succession dating to the original apostles) in a particular sense by at the latest the very early second century, and in the special sense as a Church by the fourth century, as the Church described itself as such at the Council of Nicaea, periods during which when the Church was struggling with a number of errors and used the term to distinguish itself from groups which had embraced these errors. A primary example is Donatism and the Donastists, a group prominent in a part of Africa nominally associated with the Western Churches which arose out of the scandals caused by Christians who lapsed during periods of persecution and subsequently desired restoration of union once persecutions were over; the Donatists believed believed members of the clergy must be impeccable to exercise their ministry, and therefore any who had lapsed during persecutions must be excluded should they attempt to rejoin the Church - a view which was not shared by the wider (universal) Church, was condemned, and therefore Donatists could not consider or style themselves part of the Catholic (universal) Church. 

The word *orthodox* is from the Greek *orthos* and *doxa* which combined has a general meaning of ""right believer."" It also doesn't find an origin in Christianity, but also came to be used to definitively describe apostolic Christianity in a particular sense by, at the latest, the fourth century, when it was used most correspondingly to the Arian heresy, distinguishing the correctness (orthodoxy) of the faith as again defined by the Council of Nicaea and later the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon against that held by Arius, Nestorius, and Eutyches and their followers, who were especially prominent in the East (and not orthodox). 

Ultimately, it is likely due to this prominence (of the Arians et al) in the East that the term *orthodox* was more widely and vigorously applied to describe the Churches there in the following centuries, whereas the West leaned toward *catholic* as a result of its patrimony and struggles. 

Of course, the Church which held the aforementioned Councils and which was described as both c/Catholic and o/Orthodox split in the 11th century, in what is now known as the Great Schism. At the time, however, it was not known as the Great Schism. It was one, in fact, of many schisms between Western and Eastern Churches, and at the time was not believed to be permanent (for a variety of reasons held by either side).  Ultimately, attempts at reunion (notably the Councils of Florence and Lyon, still hotly debated) failed, and as the split became more ossified, both the Western and Eastern Churches developed their own terminology, largely independent of one another. During this time, the opposing Church may simply have been called the ""Western Churches"" or the ""Eastern Churches,"" but the distinction between ""Catholic"" and ""Orthodox"" wasn't made, and you still have either side referring to itself as the ""Catholic"" *and* ""Orthodox"" Church...

...Which, in a technical sense, they *still* do, despite also using the terms Catholic and Orthodox to easily distinguish between themselves. All that said, *there is no special decree by which either Church recognizes itself or the other as strictly Catholic or Orthodox*. Rather, you have an evolving tradition within those communions to refer to themselves as such, e.g. the Catholic Church at the Second Vatican Council (mid-20th century) referring to itself as the Catholic Church in its official documents and the Orthodox Church at the Holy and Great Council of the Orthodox Church (at Crete, early 21st century) referring to itself as the Orthodox Church in its official documents...

...despite still acknowledging themselves as *both* Catholic and Orthodox in the particular, theologically significant uses of the terms. 

So, yeah: both Churches consider themselves to be both catholic *and* orthodox in the particular sense, while recognizing the other as Catholic and Orthodox in a titular sense."

890,AskHistorians,Does Oman have a dark history?,"Probably one of darker periods of Omani history was time period in which Oman and Omanis were heavily involved in the East African slave trade. 

Arabs and Persians began settling and trading in East Africa as early as the 9th and 10th centuries. There's a debate about whether this early trade between al Khaleej and East Africa involved slaves, or other goods. However by the 19th century, the trade of slaves was an integral part of the Omani economy. Oman became involved in East Africa starting in the late 17th century. After parts of the East African coast came under Omani rule, many Omanis began settling in East Africa seeing the vast economic possibilities the newly acquired land could bring, building on already established trade links between East Africa, al Khaleej and India. 

I'll specifically talk about the 19th century because that's the time period I'm most familiar with. During this time Zanzibar and Oman were dependent on each other, or to be more precise Oman was heavily dependent on Zanzibar for its financial success. ""Oman,"" if we can really even call it that was heavily bifurcated between ""Oman"" and ""Zanzibar."" Oman is what we now know of as the country on the Arabian Peninsula, and Zanzibar was not only the island we know today, but also coastal areas controlled by Omanis that stretched from Kenya to Mozambique and various islands in the Indian Ocean. For a while the capital and royal family of Oman was even moved from Muscat to Stone Town on Zanzibar island owing to its importance. Zanzibar and Oman split politically in 1856 but still remained very much intertwined with each other. 

Oman was relatively prosperous during this time. Almost all wealth was being created from activities (including the slave trade) originating in East Africa. One particular aspect of this wealth was that clove (and other) plantations were developed on Zanzibar to feed into the global market for cloves. These plantations created a high demand for slave labor. In Oman and most of the rest of the Middle East, slaves primarily served small scale less labor intensive domestic roles. However in Zanzibar, much more labor was needed for the plantations and related agricultural activities.

Slaves were taken from central Africa and marched usually in chains, to the coast. Slave traders penetrated further and further into the continent to capture slaves. This was often violent and extremely disruptive for communities in the interior. Whole villages were often enslaved or killed by these slave traders. Tippu Tip is probably the most well-known Omani slave trader. The march to the coast was brutal and an unknown number of people died along the way. Once they reached the coast they were sold locally, or shipped to Oman or other parts of al Khaleej. The number of slaves brought to the coast in the mid-19th century likely totals at least 200,000. 

The demand for slaves was less in Oman since there were few large scale agricultural establishments requiring slave labor. Between the 1830's and 1860's approximately 4,000 to 10,000 slaves from East Africa were shipped to Oman every year. Sur in Shargiya was a major slave port, and likely the primary slave port for the rest of the country. Slaves were landed in Al Aygah in Sur then divided up to be sent to the rest of the country. Muscat also had an active slave market. 

By the last half of the 19th century, pressure by European powers was mounting to stop the slave trade. The British began patrolling the Indian Ocean for slave trading vessels and attempting to ""free"" the slaves (although it should be noted here the British's intentions weren't always altruistic). The sultans of Zanzibar realized that the slave trade would face greater and greater international opposition. This culminated with the Sultanate of Zanzibar signing a treaty with the British in 1876 to essentially stop the slave trade. The treaty ended the slave trade, but allowed Arabs/Omanis to continue to keep slaves. The illegal slave trade continued until about 1902. Zanzibar abolished slavery in 1897 and Oman abolished slavery in 1962.

891,AskHistorians,"It's not uncommon for dreamcatchers to be sold as souvenirs to tourists to prevent nightmares. They are marketed as Native American. Did any Native American groups actually use dreamcatchers or are they a misappropriation of NA culture? If legit, what did these objects mean for indigenous people?","Dreamcatchers are generally believed to be related to the legends of the Spider Lady, who contrary to what might be the expectation of a modern European audience, was actually a *good* figure to indigenous American peoples across the very broad range of Western North America. Spiders feature positively in Southwestern (Puebloan and Dine cultures), Plains (Siouan and Oji-Cree cultures), and others as well, but let's focus here particularly. I do not believe all of those cultures, despite having good spiders in their legends, have quite particularly the Spider Lady we are looking for.

So, the Ojibwe nation is actually considered a *particular* origin point for the dreamcatcher concept. [Ojibwe trinkets](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Bulletin_%281929%29_%2819801535514%29.jpg/800px-Bulletin_%281929%29_%2819801535514%29.jpg) meant to mimic spiderwebs were known from at least the earliest 20th century and probably much earlier - the first written appreciation of an item does not preclude that item's widespread usage prior. These charms, meant to represent spiderwebs in appreciation for the Spider Lady and [with some associated legend about a spider weaving a web to protect a wise woman from malicious spirits](https://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=socanth_honproj), there is no *definitive* legend about the origin but the spider thread runs between them all. That is, ultimately, why it has the appearance it does.

Their current usage, though, might be considered somewhat controversial by those a hundred years ago. Some evidence suggests these weren't just wall-hangers as they so often are treated today, but instead, a form of protective magic equivalent in the West to eyes and hamsas. One quote describing this, also among the first written accounts of the 'dreamcatcher' goes thus:

>[...] the ""spiderwebs"" hung on the hoop of a cradle board. In old times this netting was made of nettle fiber. Two spider webs were usually hung on the hoop, and it was said that they ""caught any harm that might be in the air as a spider's web catches and holds whatever comes in contact with it.""

One of my sources here quotes:

>These dreamcatchers are usually hung on the child's cradleboard and the child is meant to be entertained by the feather as well as be given a lesson on the importance of good air. 

Although this latter source describes them using explicit terminology referencing their use in keeping bad dreams away, it also mentions the web being effective against 'bad air' and 'bad spirits'. This usage is also paralleled among the [Lakota](http://aktalakota.stjo.org/?page=NewsArticle&id=8820), who make equal claim to the [Dreamcatcher](https://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/Dreamcatcher-Lakota.html), and indicate that despite many today popularly associating it with the Southwest (which has its own slew of Spider Lady stories), it may have actually originated among cultures of the Northern Plains. 

While it does appear that preventing bad dreams was one intended use of the Dreamcatcher originally, it was certainly not the only one, and the primary uses of this item (a repellent of evil broadly) have fallen to the wayside in its widespread appropriation - perhaps as a factor of removing things distinct to indigenous culture and keeping what a wider, whiter audience could understand (dreams). Even the notion of dreams, though, is different to the Ojibwe than to the average Anglo-American, on a cultural level. While they are a symbol of the Pan-Indian movement today, there is no small degree of New Age Plastic Shamanism involved with their dispersion throughout wider society. Opinions involving the non-indigenous use of dreamcatchers are generally mixed, though not universally frowned upon. I am, personally, of the belief that they can be appreciated in the right context and with proper understanding, especially if purchased from indigenous persons, but as with most things the Plastic Shamans must be avoided as much as possible. 

All this said, here is a summary of the questions asked and the answers:

1) Did any indigenous groups use them?

Yes, they originate from the cultures of the northern Plains, and particularly the Ojibwa and Lakota nations have legends pertaining to their origin.

2) Are they a misappropriation?

The opinion on this is mixed. Some are okay with non-indigenous people using them, others are not. They have taken a new life and meaning in New Age movements and among Plastic Shamans, and to my understanding these are more widely frowned upon than general, generic use.

3) What did they mean to indigenous peoples?

Dreamcatchers were originally a sort of ward against harm and evil, similar to the eye amulets or hamsas of Western tradition. While they did originally 'capture' bad dreams as well, this was a mere extension of preventing evil spirits, magic, bad air, etc. from reaching its target, not as the sole dedicated use. They were eventually appropriated as a symbol of the Pan-Indian movement, and so gained a sort of neo-traditional status in a lot of communities that did not originally use them as a token of cultural expression and solidarity with their fellow indigenous peoples. 

_______________________

A bit more explanation on what dreams mean to the Ojibwe, since I mentioned that earlier:

According to some of my sources, among those already linked in this answer, it is mentioned that the Ojibwe believe in two or three distinct types of soul, something shared in common with several other indigenous peoples, including some in South America (particularly, in my reading, Carib peoples). Dreams are considered a sort of projection of one of these souls, in my source called the ""Shadow Soul"", into the spirit world, a world of prophesy that can influence important decisions like the name of a child or one's ideal path in life. In this case, dreams are similar to meditative traditions in other cultures, being a state where one's truer self may become better understood. 

Dreams are said to ""open the mind to the interdependence between body and spirit"", between the physical and immaterial worlds. A dreamcatcher, in this case, would not just be warding off mere *nightmares*, but instead keeping away bad prophesies, bad futures, malevolent spirits. The belief that the physical and immaterial world are in continuum, rather than entirely separate realms, is key, and with this understanding one must understand that malevolent entities or happenings in the spirit world (as seen in dreams) may then reflect in the physical world in a very real sense. Thus, by stopping bad dreams, it also prevents such bad things from attacking an individual in waking life, of guiding their life to misery or a bad end, much like the western concept of a curse, an evil eye, or in times past the evil magic of witches in league with Satan. The dreamcatcher was a means to prevent and avoid these supernatural inflictions, not just to have a good night's sleep, and explains how and why it being a semi-permanent fixture on a baby's carrier could help the child even while awake.

I figured it was a slight tangent to the question itself, but if nothing else, this should hopefully satisfy loose ends regarding the beliefs reflected by the original use of the dreamcatcher. I can try to supplement more if you have follow-ups, but I've been not as active as I once was, so I might not respond *too* soon - maybe a few hours, maybe a day or two, less than three days probably.

892,AskHistorians,Allied troops always wanted to capture a German Luger as a war trophy during WWII. Is there anything that German or Japanese Troops wanted to take home as a war trophy?,"Towards the end of the war, German troops were often poorly supplied with food, weapons, and ammunition, and sought to scavenge whatever they could in order to increase their combat effectiveness, or even just to get along in their daily lives. There does not seem to have been much thought in taking ""trophies"" to be sent home during this period, although some American items were prized by German soldiers.

The M1 carbine proved to be a popular weapon among German troops, as they did not have an exact equivalent, the weapon being a light (5.8 pounds loaded) carbine firing a large pistol cartridge from a fifteen-round magazine. In official German parlance, captured M1 carbines were designated *Selbstladekarabiner* (semiautomatic carbine) *455(a)*, the ""a"" standing for *Amerika*, or ""American."" Ammunition supply for captured or annexed weapons proved to be a problem unless it was put back into full-scale production again (for example, see the various Czechoslovakian tank designs co-opted by the Germans), Outside of carbines found in a mishmash of enemy weapons issued to ""last ditch"" German forces in Denmark in 1945, there did not appear to be a systematic program of storage and reissue of captured carbines, although it is very likely they, like any captured weapons or vehicles, were taken to be examined and tested. [Many photos exist](https://imgur.com/a/BY2X8K6) (one of the shots being very widely reproduced) of German troops of the task force *Kampfgruppe* Hansen (part of the 1st SS Panzer Division ""Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler"") utilizing captured M1 carbines during the Battle of the Bulge after they had ambushed a convoy of the U.S. 14th Cavalry Group near Poteau, Belgium; a more gruesome photo shows American dead lying at a crossroads stripped of their boots.

German troops were also envious of U.S. rations, as the extremely large scale of *Unternehmen Wacht Am Rhein* stretched their supply systems to their utter limit as many a German soldiers went several days without food. The horse-drawn field kitchens (*Gulaschkanone*, or ""goulash cannons,"" as their tall stove pipes resembled cannon barrels) attempted to provide as much hot food as they could, but carrying parties often became lost in the woods and when the food arrived (the usual German ration of bread and pork sausages to put in the bread bag, or hot soup if the kitchen could be emplaced) it was cold, if it even arrived at all. The German soldier in the line usually lived on the ""iron ration"" or *eiserne portionen*, consisting of canned meat (of which there was actually quite a variety, from pork, beef, sausages, to even horse meat), packaged dehydrated vegetables or pea sausage, packaged biscuits or crackers, coffee, and salt, similar in concept to the [American K-ration](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4exysw/were_cigarettes_given_as_a_ration_to_us_army/) , but much simpler without most of the accessories. The vegetables, salt, and coffee were usually kept with the field kitchen to lighten the *grenadier's* load, and he would only carry the meat and biscuits or crackers with him in combat. These rations often had to be eaten cold, as the smoke from a cooking fire could attract American artillery or mortar fire. As the Battle of the Bulge dragged on into January, the German food supply system broke down completely. 

> Hebert Brach, 6th company, 2nd BN, GR916, had this to say after finally receiving his first German rations in days, “When we had reached the foot of the hill, there stood a soldier with a loaf of bread in his hand, cutting off slice after slice, which our men practically tore out of his hand, for we had waited six days for rations, since the supply train could not be brought closer because of enemy fire. And this slice of bread was welcome to us; we were practically starving, and this bread tasted wonderful.”

*Grenadier* Brach was equally appreciative when his unit captured an American ration dump, for the American K-rations contained things unknown in any German portions, such as canned eggs, dried fruit, candy, hot chocolate or fruit-flavored drinks, gum, toilet paper, and cigarettes.

> Hebert...was very well pleased upon finding U.S. rations, “In the village (Bettendorf) itself, we appropriated an American food and clothing storehouse in a convent. Now for a pleasant change we had enough to eat. Everybody feasted on the tasty U.S. field rations, and nobody asked where our field kitchen was.” Brach continued with another account of U.S. rations, “In Bettendorf the grenadiers had stuffed their pockets, food bags and assault packs again with food from an undestroyed US ration dump. In fact, some of them had even rounded up old baby carriages and milk carts and filled them with food…That evening, after several days, the field kitchen finally came to Diekirch to supply us with hot food, but nobody was hungry, thanks to the tasty delicacies from much sought after-American rations. The supply chief himself came on the scene and was annoyed to have to take the watery stew away again.

The Germans also obtained local food, such as fruit, bread, meat, and potatoes, from the cabinets or cellars of abandoned houses. Very late in the war, the Germans issued in limited numbers what essentially amounted to a direct copy of the American K-ration, containing in a small cardboard box, among other items, candy, cigarettes, chocolate, dried fruit bars, and biscuits.

893,AskHistorians,"Sad women comforting themselves with chocolate is a common stereotype. Before the arrival of chocolate in the old world, was there another food stereotypically desired by sad women? And when did the chocolate stereotype come from to begin with?","> I then divert my self with my two sweete children, think of all my kind friends, and take a dish of chocolate, which I find the greatest cordiall and reviveing in the world.

> *-Anne Dormer, c.1690*

Western, especially North American, culture in particular has forged long-lasting stereotypical associations between (a) women and chocolate (b) chocolate and medicine (c) children and sweets.

The use and consumption of cacao has an ancient, ancient past in its Mesoamerican home. In terms of colonialist chroniclers' awareness, they refer initially to ""chocolate"" as a drink that the Mexica believed was a stimulant in battle and an aphrodesiac--so, more associated with men than women.

But by 1590, Jose de Acosta could write:

> It disgusts
those who are not used to it, for it has a foam on top, or a scum-like
bubbling...It is a valued drink, which the Indians offer to the lords who
come or pass through their land. And the Spanish men, and even more
the Spanish women, are addicted to the black chocolate. 

Around this time, too, other priests rail against women in Mexico who are sneaking cups of chocolate into Mass with them.

So you see that while in actuality the link is between nobility/wealth and chocolate, it's *framed as* one between women and chocolate. The stereotype despite consumption by women and men persists further into the early modern era and back to Europe.

In 1663, the archbishop of Prague wrote:

> Those meddlesome women, how gladly they have hunted down all the stores [of the cardinal's chocolate] and quite helped themselves.

There were two problems, though: first, chocolate remained a prestige for the *nobility* (hence the archbishop of Prague receiving stores of chocolate).

Second, and very relevant for our purposes here, chocolate in early modern Europe was an important *medicine*. There was a strong cultural link between chocolate and feeling better, along with the stereotype of women loving chocolate. Scholars who've worked with the letters of Anne Dormer, quoted above, have rooted her turn to chocolate in this idea.

Male moralists in the later 19th century, though, worked to strengthen the association between women and chocolate in kind of a sideways fashion. They turned chocolate and other sweet things into ""dainty"" and ""childlike"" treats--the proper food for children...and for their mothers. Certainly not for men! In World War I, in fact, it took major campaigns to get American troops in Europe to consume the quick, easy energy of candy, because the food had such strong feminine associations.

Gender continues to play a strong role in people's actual choice of comfort food--and, perhaps, an even stronger one in *stereotypes*. Wansink and Sangermann (2000) found in one survey that 74% of women listed ice cream as one of their top three comfort foods, and 69% listed chocolate. Men included soup, and for some reason ""pizza or pasta"" counted together.

W&S suggested that this meant women preferred prepackaged foods; men preferred foods that other people prepared for them. (I'm very sure that the majority of pizza and soup consumed today is homemade, aren't you?)

Charles Spence (2017) was more direct, drawing out the pop psych:

> Notice the place of hot main meals as comfort food for men, or as one newspaper headline put it: ""Women like sugar, men like meat.""

Yes, men included soup in their top three, and pizza and pasta *if counted together*.

...And 77% of them said ice cream. Ice cream, my favorite homemade hot food.

The three psychologists' insistence on disregarding the actual evidence for stereotypes suggests there is a lot more research to be done on the role of stereotypes and gender roles with comfort foods."
894,AskHistorians,"Alexandre Dumas' father Thomas-Alexandre was descended from a French noble and a slave of African descent. He also became the highest-ranking man of mixed African descent ever in a European army, during the French Revolutionary Wars. What do we know of attitudes/discrimination towards him in France?","Tom Reiss wrote a biography of Thomas-Alexandre Dumas called *The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal and the Real Count of Monte-Cristo*. In it, he argues that Dumas was rarely discriminated against once he gained rank in the French Revolutionary Army, and that Napoléon's late discharge of Dumas was more a result of rancour than racism.

He compares their life trajectories : both rising stars of the early years of the French Revolution, leading armies through various assignments (in the Alps and then in Northern Italy, in the Rhine army) while escaping sanctions from the Committee of Public Safety. They fought together first in Italy from late 1796 to early 1797, and later on in Egypt.

Its relation with Napoléon is caracterised by Reiss as complex, as Napoléon recognised in Dumas a real military talent, requesting him to lead his cavalry in Egypt, but also a potential threat. Indeed, Dumas always put first the ideals of the Republic, and then the orders of his superior. It was made clear during the forced march from Alexandria to Cairo in Egypt, where Dumas organised a meeting between several high-ranking officers (Lannes and Murat among them) to discuss and potentially defy the orders of Napoléon. Napoléon confronted him about it, and shortly after Dumas asked for a new assignment. He was captured by the Naples kingdom on his way home, and was ignored by the new French government lead by Napoléon for the next year and a half. 

During this time, the French Army started discriminating against peoples of color, ultimately banning any colored soldier from approaching Paris in 1802. This law presumably prevented Dumas from trying to recover in person the money he was owed by the army, and his letters were thoroughly ignored as well. According to Tom Reiss, and in his Memoirs Alexandre Dumas agrees with him, it was Napoléon's rancour that left him stranded in Tarente and then almost pennyless.

Reiss also compares his life with the Knight of Saint-Georges, a colored duel specialist turned leader of the American Legion. The Legion was entirely manned by colored people from the French colonies in America, and Saint-Georges chose Dumas as his second-in-command.  The fall from grace of Saint-Georges was the result of his years in the royal army, not his origins. 

Dumas would rise in the Army, the ideals of equality under the law of the Republic helping him go from a slave sold by his father to general-in-chief until Napoléon ended his career and brought back discriminatory laws from the monarchy years."
895,AskHistorians,Did the Nazis look for mythological artifacts?,"Well, there was Otto Rahn, German medievalist, SS-Obersturmführer, and Grail Hunter for the Nazis. Rahn himself is a rather marginal figure even within Nazi occultism and while commonly held that in the early stages to have been a talented historian, his name as well as his work is mostly remembered because a.) Indiana Jones had a sinister version of him on screen and b.) his work not only kindled interest in Catharism in the 1930s but were very popular among those responsible for the esoteric and non-academic Catharism revival of the 1960/70s, which gave the world the dubious basis for Dan Brown's DaVinci Code. Basically, it was Rahn who invented the connection between the Cathars and the Holy Grail.

Rahn was born in 1904 and studied Law, Literature and Philology in Giessen and Heidelberg. Despite there being some confusion about whether he actually finished his studies, it is certain that by 1928 he had developed an intense interest in the Cathars, an alleged Christian dualist sect in the South of France, and the Albigensians Crusade, which destroyed the Cathars in the 13th century. Developing a close relationship with French Mystic Antonin Gadal, it was during these travels that Rahn developed his theory of the Grail and the Cathars:

Because, drawing on dubious sources – as is the history of Cathars in general as [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/49rn50/how_did_catharism_start_develop_and_become_so/) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hione/did_any_cathars_survive_the_albignesian_crusade/) demonstrate – there was the theory among Rahn and people like him that the Cathars had hidden some kind of important treasure. Because Rahn had read the poetic Parzival Saga of  Wolfram von Eschenbach, he became convinced that the Grail Castle mentioned in Parzival was actually the Cathar Castle at Montségur, which was the last one to fall during the Albigensians Crusade. Rahn's evidence for this was that in Parzival the Grail castle was called Munsalvaesche, which Rahn took to mean Montségur. And so, by virtue of a questionable etymological connection was born the theory that Cathars had hidden the grail from the Church and had thus been destroyed for this.

Over the next couple of years, Rahn traveled Southern France and the ruins of Cathar castles and so forth to search for the Grail; a search that was abruptly ended when he was sued for being out of money and accused by French authorities of spying for the Germans. By this time, he had also become very friendly with the SS and Himmler in Germany. Himmler, who was particularly interested in medieval myth and legend to construct from them a ""Germanic"" religion rivaling ""Jewish"" Christendom, took it upon himself to further help Rahn out.

Rahn, who with the help of Himmler had published his bog book *Crusade Against the Grail: The Struggle between the Cathars, the Templars, and the Church of Rome* in 1934, would go on to join the SS and develop his theories further: According to him, the Cathars not only held the Grail, but the mixture of medieval heresy, grail legend, and the suppression of the Cathars in a crusade to him formed a new picture. Because of the alleged connection to Eschenbach's Parzival, Rahn posited that the Cathars were not a Christian Sect but in reality had been a Gnostic religion of Aryan-Germanic origin representing the ""original"" Germanic ur-religion, which was violently suppressed by the Catholic Church in service of the Jews. He went on to travel again to France, Italy, and even Iceland because to him it became clear the Cathars, the Holy Grail, the mysitcal island of Thule so popular among German occultists like Himmler, and even the Tibetan Buddhists legend of Shambala were all connected (Cathars, in his opinion being ""the Buddhists of Europe""). He also further connected this with the World Ice Theory of Hannes Hörbinger and other, similar, BS theories.

While Rahn's hunt for the Grail was – obviously – not successful, his books *Crusade* and *Luzifers Hofgesind, eine Reise zu den guten Geistern Europas*, both of which were barely veiled SS and Nazi Germania propaganda were hugely popular among certain esoteric and mystically inclined people, not the least Heinrich Himmler.

But while until 1938 Himmler was a huge fan of Rahn and financial backer for his hunt for the grail, in 1938 Rahn was transferred away from his research and had to perform guard duties in the Buchenwald and Dachau Concentration Camps for four months (it is speculated that this might be related to his alcoholism), after which he left the SS (allegedly because of homosexual leanings). In March 1939 a few days before his planned wedding, where Himmler would have been an honor guest, Rahn died hiking in the Tyrolean mountains. Some write he slipped and then froze while hiking, others allege he committed suicide, while still others want to see a more sinister conspiracy behind Rahn's death.

Whatever it was, Rahn's dubious theories live – undeservedly – on through all the dubious literature on the Cathars and the Grail and while his Grail hunt was less spectacular than in the Indiana Jones movies – most of what he did was explore caves and spend time in dusty archives –, he is indeed one of the most recent people to have embarked on a Grail quest.

896,AskHistorians,"In ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" the protagonist serves as a private for 5 or 6 whole years during the First World War and is never promoted. Was it common? What did he have to do to be promoted?","Men both starting and ending their service as privates or other low ranks is not uncommon. It happens much more often in wartime, when the military is very small in peacetime, or when it is forced to expand massively in a short period of time. Promotion to the next rank after a specified period of time, such as six months, did not exist in many militaries, or did not come about until recently. In war, some men are good soldiers, but are simply ""forgotten"" in the bureaucracy.

The German Empire utilized conscription, with men entering active service for two years at the age of 21, although they could join the *Landsturm* at 17. Military service for ordinary males around the time of World War I could last then, in most cases, for a maximum of 26-29 years either in an active, reserve, or militia component. It was uncommon for a short-term conscript *musketier*, *infanterist*, or *soldat* (private) to be promoted; non-commissioned officers above the rank of *gefreiter* (roughly equivalent to private first class or lance corporal) were drawn from a pool of career soldiers who had volunteered for active duty beyond their initial term, and their promotions strictly scrutinized by their commanding officers until vacancies appeared. Promotions from the enlisted ranks to the officer corps did not exist until 1918.

Component|Ages

*Landsturm*|17-20
*Stehendes Heer*|21-22 (half)

The below part of the answer applies to the United States in World War I, the interwar period, and World War II, although the same general idea could be applied to France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, or any number of major powers. 

Each unit in the United States Army operated (and still operates) under what is most commonly known as a table of organization and equipment (although other names were used for it in the past). The table of organization and equipment of a unit, taking into account its tactical or strategic function, lays out its organization, the number of men assigned to it, their roles and allowed ranks, and the amount of equipment assigned to each man or to the unit as a whole. 

> For each unit the T/O&E prescribed the number of its officers and men, the grade and job of each, the proportion of various occupational specialists, the arrangement of command and staff and administrative personnel, the means of transport and communications, the provisions for supply, maintenance, construction, and medical care, and the kind and quantity of individual and unit armament, together with the relationship between supporting weapons and consequently the tactics of the unit.

[Here is the table of organization and equipment of an American rifle company, adopted in 1918](https://imgur.com/a/6IShz)

During the interwar period, promotions in the small U.S. Army were uncommon due to the parsimony of Congress and the stranglehold of the Great Depression. It was common, especially in the National Guard of the United States, to let underage men of fifteen or sixteen in; it often guaranteed for the Depression family at least some money each month.

[Here is the table of organization and equipment of an American rifle company, adopted in 1944](http://militaryresearch.org/7-17%2026Feb44.pdf)

The table of organization and equipment lays out specifics in regards to rank and the roles men performed based upon that rank. If a man was promoted to a rank above what his old position dictated in the table of organization and equipment, he would need to be re-trained to fill his new position, and possibly take on a different role. If there were no vacancies available in a higher position that a man could reasonably be re-trained for, he would not be promoted, at least until a vacancy opened. Exceptions to this rule include [battlefield promotions, either out of necessity, or out of action](https://imgur.com/a/nx2oC); if a man distinguished himself in combat and there happened to be an un-filled vacancy, he would be promoted and re-trained instead of a replacement of a higher rank being requisitioned and assigned. 

The table of organization and equipment also lists the number of ""allowed"" ranks in an organization. The 1944 American rifle company of 193 men ""allowed"" a maximum of one captain, three first lieutenants, two second lieutenants, one first sergeant, four technical sergeants, sixteen staff sergeants, fifteen sergeants, one corporal, two technicians grade 4, four technicians grade 5, 40 privates first class, and 104 privates. The privates first class were 28 percent of all privates, and hence promotions could occur up to a maximum of 40 out of 144, if the table of organization and equipment was followed to the letter (which it often was not).

The use of individual replacements in the U.S. Army also intervened to make promotion more uncommon. [If Sarge or Lieutenant became a casualty, Private Doe often wouldn't be promoted, and a replacement would be brought in](https://imgur.com/a/AcVhO). Promotion from the enlisted ranks, particularly ""low"" ones, directly to the officer corps in combat during World War II was a celebrated event in unit journals, with formal ceremonies often taking place. [Mass promotions also took place, if only to bring the unit into closer conformation with the table of organization and equipment it was operating under](https://imgur.com/a/hcNB2). Soldiers could be promoted while away from their unit, such as while being held as a prisoner of war or recovering in a hospital.

897,AskHistorians,"What was so appealing about the bra that it completely replace the corset? From my understanding the corset had been around a long time, why was it done away with relatively quickly?","The most important aspect of an answer to this question is that the brassiere was invented well before World War I and existed contemporaneously with the corset. 

From about 1895 through 1927, there was a continuous loosening and streamlining of the overall lines of fashion and construction techniques - if you compare day dresses of comparable original values made in just 1895 and 1905, you're generally going to see a less sturdy lining in the second and overall lighter fabrics in general; the exterior fabric of the bodice is going to be cut in a different shape than the lining so that it doesn't look as structured and appears to float over the body, and the skirt and sleeves probably aren't lined at all. Very likely there are fewer different fabrics used and ornamentation is with lace ruffles or overlays rather than heavy beads. Likewise, from 1905 to 1915 you can see the skirt lose its train, become shorter, and go from a complex shape with multiple gores or tucks to something like an A-line, while sleeves stopped being made to curve with the arm and were instead basically symmetrical, front to back.

Corsets likewise were changing over this period. From 1895 to 1905, the whole thing started to move down the body - the fashionable bustline became lower (accentuated by the bloused cut of the bodice) and the corset became more focused on flattening the stomach and giving a curve to the hips and backside. By 1915, again, corsets rarely even supported the bust at all! (Even after this time, the fact that corsets were eventually deemed ""inessential"" in America and the UK and their materials diverted to the war effort had very little effect on whether or not women actually wore them - it just meant that they couldn't purchase new ones for a few years. Pop history has made a lot out of it but there's little to suggest that it had a large knock-on effect.) The brassiere was actually invented to deal with this in the first decade of the twentieth century, and was at the time more like a slightly shaped cotton crop-top worn over the corset to give the bust a bit of support without raising or defining it. Far from being a replacement for the corset at the time, it was an add-on - and often they were made with a tab at the bottom of the front to attach it to the corset tightly to create more tension for more support.

It is not  accurate to say that the early twentieth century killed the corset: the girdle industry boomed during this time. Even during the 1920s, when women were in theory celebrating their natural figures, it failed to die. (I also have to disagree that the lithe 1920s silhouette came up from the lower classes and couldn't make inroads with the upper classes - again, if you go back to the late 1900s/early 1910s, this is *very* clearly a style emanating from high fashion; actresses were declaring at that time that they didn't need to wear corsets and avant-garde designers were producing informal clothing like Mariano Fortuny's ""Delphos dress"", a slim sheath of tightly pleated silk that would cling to the wearer's uncorseted body and show every natural flaw.) It's difficult to imagine given the popular narrative of youth and freedom, but much of that narrative has been driven by stereotype. The new twentieth-century girdle was much touted as more comfortable and flexible than the corset due to the use of elastic and spiral steel, but it was still effectively a corset. In the 1930s and 1940s, they were still commonly worn, whether as lower-torso shapewear or as bra-and-girdle-in-one corselets. One major advancement in the 1950s was the popularization of a strapless bra attached to a short corset/girdle (now usually called a ""Merry Widow""), which led to and/or was driven by the popularization of the iconic strapless or halter-top evening dresses of the period.

What *really* killed the corset was the 1960s. Where the 1920s tends to be oversimplified into a quick narrative about the flappers as a youth movement, the 1960s saw a serious counterculture develop that some pioneering designers were quick to get on with. An extreme minimalism of cut, material, and ornamentation took place, with the most extreme version being the one-use-only paper dress. Wearing anything but the lightest kind of bra as a support garment was irredeemably square. Older and more conservative women would continue to make use of structured shapewear, but it would never again achieve the kind of ordinariness that it had had previously."
898,AskHistorians,"I'm a tailor in Regency London and Sir Richard Dastardly, a rakish baronet, is ignoring my bills. How would I as a small business owner deal with this?","As a small business owner, you would have recourse for dealing with deadbeat customers. A guy like Pip or Rawdon Crawley wouldn't be allowed to fleece you forever, unless you let them--and if Sir Richard Dastardly was rich enough, sometimes you would just let it slide for a little bit. If they ""paid you in exposure"" and sent their (possibly more solvent) friends to you to buy suits or dresses, you might let it slide for a little while, just to be neighborly and keep the peace. But if you were doing House of Worth work for pawnshop pay, you'd eventually get fed up. You'd start sending duns/debt collectors to knock on their door, hoping the annoyance and potential shame would convince them to pony up. At this point, he might contract with a moneylender for a promissory note; the lender would pay you and charge Dastardly interest, and Dastardly would be out of your hair.

If your debtor doesn't find a way to pay you, your next step is prosecution. You want Sir Richard to actually show up for the trial, so you bring legal action against him and pay a shilling for an arrest warrant. A sheriff's officer serves the warrant and will take Sir Richard Dastardly to a sponging house. There, you have some time to settle or you'll end up on trial/in jail.

If it gets to trial, and Dastardly is found to be a debtor, they stick him in jail. You can't just take his stuff, however, not yet -- he still has to decide to pay you, by selling his own stuff or borrowing money from family and friends. Rawdon Crawley never gets to this point, but a number of Dickens characters did. Usually, if you ended up in debtor's prison, you were already poor--not a Sir Richard Dastardly. Typically, a person with a title would have resources: they could sell land, a horse, beg Auntie for cash, or marry some wealthy heiress. If you were poor and in debtor's prison, you did have some light at the end of the tunnel: you could still ply certain trades from within prison, and you could eventually hope to get out. But it was miserable and difficult to drag oneself out of that debt hole. (Imprisonment for debt was abolished in 1869.)

Now, as to your question, ""Did they care?"" I think they cared about as much as we do. Victorians were a little more moralistic than we are now in that they were generally more likely to judge their neighbors as ""bad"" than put the circumstance ahead of their judgment -- but a lot of their attitudes are similar to today's. Being a serial debtor was more personal to the Victorians than it is to us, because there were, with the possible exception of the East India Company, no giant faceless monolithic companies to which you would owe money. You'd owe money to Bob the tailor and Joe the greengrocer, guys who lived probably within a few miles' radius of your own house, not to MasterCard. No one goes hungry if you don't pay MasterCard, but a Victorian person refusing to make good on his debts was literally taking money away from his neighbors, which was a bad look. Tongues would start wagging when the debt collectors came knocking, and a Sir Richard type might find himself not invited to as many parties as before. If he had romantic prospects, they could dry up: the father of a young lady isn't going to want his daughter hooking up with a spendthrift who'll end up in prison and will be unable or unwilling to provide for his family. If he's part of a gentleman's club, depending on how bad his money woes are (and whether or not all the other men in his club have similar attitudes towards money), he could find himself kicked out. 

There were jerks, con men, liars, and people who had ""f-you"" amounts of money where they could gleefully skip town on Bob the Tailor and not care. There were no credit scores in the time period, but all you had was your name. If you developed a reputation as a sketchball, tailors wouldn't want to do work for you on credit anymore--no matter who you were. Tailors for the most part couldn't afford to give their work away for free. You'd have to pay cash. If you had cash, this wouldn't actually be a big deal, which is why a lot of wealthier people might only care about their debts insofar as their reputation could be affected. If Bob didn't want to play ball anymore, they'd just pay Bob the cash and get credit from some other poor slob. If you didn't have cash, this would be a serious issue for you. Some ""wealthy"" people didn't actually have ""ready money,"" only large fixed assets like land or houses, which they would then have to mortgage or sell if they'd tanked their reputation/credit, or who were known to be out of money even if they'd never had a debt problem. Like today, a lot of ""rich people"" were cash-poor, and kept an appearance of wealth by leveraging what they did have to get more.

EDIT: I corrected the naming. While “Sir Dastardly” sounded like a very interesting person to me, and is more descriptive of his character, the commenter below is right—it’s Sir Richard (Sir Dick if ya nasty)."
899,AskHistorians,"Since 1513, Denmark has alternated kings called Frederick and Christian. What is the reason for this and how has no king in over 500 years broken the tradition?","The simple answer is tradition.
The royal house of Denmark has kept a non-violent transition of power since Frederik I ousted his nephew, Christian the second, in 1523. Christian the second's father was king Hans, and the last male danish monarch who didn't bear the name Christian og Frederik.

During the rennaisance, it became the norm for European Monarchs to keep to a few names in the line of kings in a given country, to the degree were new kings would change their name if they succeeded to the throne without the proper name. A late example of this is king george VI of England. George, who was initially named Albert, wasn't expected to succeed to the throne, being the younger brother, but, upon his brother's resignation from the Throne, he took the name George, to keep the tradition of the royal names (George, Edward, William and James). You see the same in france (Philip, Louis) and most other European monarchies. 
This tradition originated in the middle ages, where it was common for noblemen, and kings especially, to be named after one of their forefathers, usually another king. This is evident in the danish line of kings, where you initially only find Gorm, Harald, Svend and Knud (Svein and Canute in English, because of inferior pronounciation). These names are used exclusively, until the sons of Svend Estridsen come into power. Svend had more than 20 children, and at least 10 of these where males. Of these 10 males, 5 (including the youngest of them) became kings. At this time, name changes weren't normal, and it would have been ridiculous to have 10 boys with only 4 names to go around. So besides an obligatory Harald, Knud, and two Svends, there was an Oluf and a Niels, who both became kings. What folowed was a series of civil wars, which lasted throughout the 11th and 12th centuries. The winners of these civil wars usually wouldn't name their sons after their rivals, which led to the abandonment of Svend and Harald, and to the Ascension of Valdemar (who was named after his slavic maternal grandfather king Vladimir). 3 more Valdemars followed, and it is still a rather normal middle name for the danish princes. 
Now, during the middle ages, the kings were usualy warrior-kings, meaning they fought, and often died, in battles. Between 1067 and 1387, literally half of the danish kings died violently. But during the rennaisance, the kings became court-kings instead. This, along with the increasing reliance on using other generals than the king, and keeping him away from the front lines, meant that no danish king in the last 500 years died violently. Not even Christian the 2nd, who was ousted,but allowed to live out his life in imprisonement. This resulted in a much more stable line of succesion, which coincidentally resulted in a much more stable and limited list of names.

Sauce: for the medieval kings, Gesta Danorum, by Saxo Gramatticus, along with almost anything by Niels lund, Nils Hybel and Michael Gelting.
For the rennaisance kings i can recommend almost any book by Sebastian Olden-Jørgensen.

Hope this answered your question, and doesn't get.... modded. :)"
900,AskHistorians,"After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, a fleet of 235 ships of Anglo-Saxon nobility apparently fled the country and sailed to the Byzantine Empire. What became of them and their descendants? What do we know of their life there?","So there are a few sources that point to an influx of Englishmen into the Byzantine Empire in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest.  Oderic Vitalis and his *Ecclesiastical History* makes mention of an English influx towards Byzantium.  Anna Komnena makes a rather vague allusion to the island of ""Thule"" as the source of the Varangian Guard at the time of her father's ascension to the throne, but the identification of Thule with Britain is contentious. Her style of writing is full of classicism and clearly deliberately anachronistic references, for example she refers to the Scythians as enemies of the 11th century Roman Empire, frequently refers to ""hoplites"" for soldiers, and so on.  Other later sources also mention the English influx into Byzantium and particularly the Varangian Guard.  There are enough varied sources that it seems pretty clear to me that the influx did happen and made enough of an impression that the English were associated with the Varangians in Byzantium for quite some time.  Other sources that mention this influx are a Norse saga and French historical chronicle, as well as later Byzantine documents that refer to the British and English.

Some of these later sources mention that the English founded settlements in the Black Sea but this is a pretty tall order to believe without corroborating archaeological evidence.  Evidence, which as of yet, has not been discovered.  It is also worth noting that, despite a presence in Crimea, at the time of the English entrance into Constantinople the Byzantines were hardly in a position to be giving land around the Black Sea.  That certainly might not have stopped them, but this is all very speculative and there isn't a great deal to base claims of English settlement in the Black Sea off of.  Instead I'll focus on the experience of the English in Byzantine service.  


Some scholars have proposed relatively robust relations between England and the Byzantine empire.  This is not so far fetched as the geographic distances might imply.  According to Saxo Grammaticus, Harold Godwinson's daughter, Gyda, married a prince of the Kievan Rus, a people virtually on the doorstep of the Byzantine Empire, and with extensive relations with their Imperial neighbors.  Harald Hardrade, admittedly not an Englishman, famously found service in the Empire and he ended up across the Scandinavian world before dying in England.  For well off members of the Anglo-Saxon world ending up in the neighborhood of the Byzantine Empire was very possible.  

Now once the Englishmen were in Byzantium what happened to them?  What kind of life awaited them?  Many of the questions that you have are sadly impossible to answer.  We will never know exactly how/if they assimilated into Byzantine culture, whether they adopted Greek or how they were received beyond some very banal platitudes.  We also know very little of the organization of the Varangian Guard as well so it impossible to tell how the English might have been seen by others serving as mercenaries or by other members of the court.  We can have a few guesses, and there has been some tentative work done on attempting to identify areas of English influence within Byzantine sources and structures.  A French scholar even claims to have identified a church that the English might have been involved with.  The religious divisions between Byzantium and the Latin West, although they had formally flared up with the ""Great Schism"" of 1054 were likely still more or less amicable in practice at this time.  Its unlikely the Englishmen felt a need at this time to ""convert"" to Eastern Orthodoxy.

However, if we accept the entrance of a significant number of Englishmen into the Varangian guard around the time of Alexios Kommenos's ascent to the throne we can safely assume that many of them would have been involved in the battles that he fought, and indeed Anna Komnena mentions the ""axe wielding barbarians"" serving under a general named Nabites.  During the invasion of Robert Guiscard, a Norman from southern Italy, into the Byzantine Empire, the Varangians and their commander commanded one of the flanks during a battle between the Byzantines and the Normans.  During this battle the Varangians acquitted themselves quite well, and repulsed a Norman attack and drove many of them from the field and into the sea.  However, in their over eagerness to engage the ""Franks"" they were cut off from the rest of the Byzantine lines and routed.  Some attempted to seek refuge in a church but the building was burned by the Normans with the soldiers still inside.  Nabites himself and at least some of the guard survived as they are also mentioned in Anna Komnena's account of the wars between Alexios and the ""Scythians"" after the defeat of the Normans in Epirus.  

While it is speculative, it is likely safe to assume that a few of the Englishmen who had entered into Byzantine service met their end in the battle against the Normans and in subsequent campaigns for the Byzantines.  Despite this, there was a lingering association between the English and the Varangian Guard for quite some time.  Whether this association was more than a stereotype is unfortunately impossible to ascertain; as is the nature of the life of Englishmen in Byzantium."
901,AskHistorians,Otto von Bismarck famously anticipated that the next great European war would be the result of some 'damned foolish thing in the Balkans'.

903,AskHistorians,"In 1986, Microsoft Windows advertising stipulated Windows was available ""except in Nebraska"". Why?","Windows *was* available in Nebraska. This commercial is a parody of other commercials that, for legal reasons, had to exclude Nebraska. That line in this commercial is a wink and a nod to that.

So what was up with those commercials being parodied? 

Prior to 1991, all 800 numbers were carrier-specific. Because of the mixed-up telephone system the US had after breakup of Bell, this meant that to call from one side of the country to another (such as on an 800 call), you may have to cross several carriers. This could get expensive.

To limit this, companies with 800 numbers got wise and centralized in the middle of the US. Due to its central location, Nebraska ended up the destination of many call centers for the, on average, cheaper 800 call rates. So companies moved their call centers to Nebraska for financial reasons.

But why did that make offers void? Because this 800 system *could not successfully route in-state and out-of-state calls* until 1981, when AT&T developed the tech to do so.

So throughout the 60s, 70s, and early 80s, the offers were void to Nebraska callers because they literally could not make the phone call.

As dumb as this sounds, remember: until the government stepped in in 1983, phone companies wouldn’t even allow consumers to own their own phone!

As an aside, there are still a lot of call centers in Nebraska, but the restirctions on 800 numbers being loosened has created a long, slow exodus of such jobs.

904,AskHistorians,Why did Hitler not crush the British army when he had it surrounded and cut off at Dunkirk?,"Well... It wasn't so much Hitler as much as it was Hitler's commanders. In particular, it was Gerd von Rundstedt, commander of the German Army Group A, that made the decision. You see, at the start of WW2, Hitler did not micromanage his military as much, leaving quite a bit of the decisions to the discretion of his commanders. 

To understand Dunkirk, we must go first to the opening stages of the Battle of France. When Germany invaded, the French had a long line of fortifications (the Maginot Line) facing the German border. The French expected that the Maginot Line would force the Germans to attack France through Belgium. This was exactly what happened, but Belgium can be roughly divided into two regions: the lowlands, and a heavily-forested stretch known as the Ardennes. The French knew that the Germans were good at tank warfare, and since the Ardennes was poor tank country, they thought the main attack would come through the lowlands. The Ardennes was also very rugged, and the French believed it would take the Germans at least a week to get through. Since the French expected that the majority of the German forces could be committed to the lowlands, that is where they sent their elite forces. Some forces were assigned to defend the Ardennes approach, but they were basically the weaker, poorer-trained parts of the French military. 

So, what the Germans did, was that they took a big gamble and it paid off. They committed much of their best forces to the Ardennes approach while launching a simultaneous phoney attack at the lowland approach. This deceived the Allied forces (French, British, and Belgian) into believing they were in the right place, while the elite German forces swept aside the weaker part of the French as well as Belgian forces and broke through into France. Their motorized, armoured divisions leading the charge, the Germans had made it past the Ardennes in two days rather than a week. By 19 May, 1940, the Germans had destroyed the French forces (primarily the French Ninth Army) guarding the Meuse River that faced the Ardennes approach. The best of the French forces and their British allies, who had hitherto been preoccupied fighting off phoney attacks, were now cut off from the rest of France. 

By May 21, the Allies realized they were basically surrounded by the enemy and stuck in Belgium. German forces were quickly moving to encircle the Allies. The French forces stuck in the north were ordered to fight their way south, to reunite with the rest of the French military. The British on the other hand, were not operating on entirely the same orders as the French, and poor communication between the Allies even led to friendly fire. The British did, however, participate in the planned French counterattack against the Germans to break out. This was called the Battle of Arras, and it was a failure. Although Allied forces made early gains, the Germans (particularly Rommel's division) quickly organized a defensive response. Bad communication between the Allies made them slow to take advantage of potential opportunities, and the Allies suffered heavily. 

What the Battle of Arras did do, however, was put a scare into the German commanders. During the Battle of Arras, the Germans realized that the speed of their advance meant that some tank divisions had outrun the infantry divisions, leaving tanks without infantry support and vice versa. German commanders worried about being outflanked. Although Rommel successfully held his ground, he made alarmist claims that he had been attacked by hundreds of British tanks (when the reality was 88 tanks, more or less), and was in favor of sitting tight until the infantry divisions caught up. The Germans basically felt like they had overextended themselves, and despite beating back the Arras counterattack, they feared they might not be able to fend off a second counterattack (unaware of the dire straits of the Allies post-Arras). In light of these considerations, the leading commander of the German forces in the area, Gerd von Rundstedt, called for a halt in the German advance. 

Rundstedt estimated the infantry needed 36 hours to catch up, when in reality it took 48 hours before the German advance could resume. 

This brief period of respite allowed the British to rally themselves after the chaos at Arras, and they retreated to the English Channel, to the beaches of Dunkirk, where the evacuation of 400,000 British soldiers trapped there would begin. 

After the Germans regrouped, they did exactly as you said, and tried to crush the British army stranded in Dunkirk while they had them cut off and surrounded. Only this wasn't as easy as it sounded. Remember, there was still a French component stuck on the wrong side of France with the British, and they fought valiantly in the face of near-certain defeat with desperate rearguard actions. Also, you must factor in the British Royal Air Force and the British Royal Navy's contributions. The RAF in particular flew over 3,500 sorties, using 16 squadrons, and met the Luftwaffe in fierce dogfights that exacted a heavy toll on the German bombers. Because the RAF's dogfights took place far from the beaches (if the Luftwaffe reached the beaches it was already too late, they had broken past the RAF), much of the Army was unaware of the RAF's brave attempts to protect them. Many soldiers thus bitterly complained about the RAF doing nothing to help, painfully unaware of the pilots fighting and dying in the skies far away from them until they had safely returned home. In essence, all this manage to delay the Germans long enough for the British to escape. 

Keep in mind that while the German halt order after Arras may have bought valuable time for the British to evacuate from Dunkirk, the Germans were probably in need of a halt order anyway. Their armored divisions were way ahead of their supporting infantry, and they had been fighting all the way from the Ardennes; they were in dire need of repair and refueling. 

TL;DR version, Hitler/the Germans did not crush the British army while he had it surrounded and cut off at Dunkirk, because in the sheer impetus of the blitzkrieg into France, his infantry hadn't caught up to his tanks/armour, and the tanks/armour needed rest, repair, and refueling. The Germans then got hit with a counterattack by Allied forces trying to break out of the German encirclement, got scared, and decided to halt and catch their breath. Once they were regrouped and recovered, the Germans did their best to crush the British at Dunkirk, but ultimately failed due to the valiant yet doomed French forces fighting a rearguard action and the bravery of both the British Navy and the Air Force coming to the rescue of the trapped Army.

Hope this helped!

905,AskHistorians,The Epic of Gilgamesh was rediscovered in 1853. How did the Victorian sensibilities of the time react to its very frank depictions of sexuality?,"A note to my readers: Given the nature of the text in question, there is sexually explicit material in my explanation.

The Victorians focused much more on the perceived Biblical connections of the Epic of Gilgamesh, and many Victorian-era translations either romanticized or skipped the sexual scenes completely. (I should note that I study the Victorian period, and my knowledge of Assyria, its culture, and its literature is hazy at best.)

In 1849, British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard and his assistant Hormuzd Rassam started excavating Nineveh. In 1853, Rassam excavated the palace of Ashurbanipal, finding thousands of fired clay tablets gathered by the king. Among them were the broken tablets that contained the Epic of Gilgamesh, but this wouldn't be discovered for decades. 1853 is also notable for being the year Sir Henry Rawlinson succeeded in deciphering cuneiform, using in large part a three-language inscription from Darius the Great known as the Behistun inscription. (An interesting and revealing side-story: Rawlinson describes having to balance ladders on very narrow lips of rock and then stand on the very top rung to copy down the text. When there was a passage the ladders could not reach and none of the British dared climb, Rawlinson did a very Victorian British thing: he hired a Kurdish boy to climb up, gripping with his fingers and toes, and take a rubbing, promising him ""a considerable reward if he succeeded."") 

The first person to translate a part of the Epic of Gilgamesh was a young British scholar named George Smith. Smith, who had left school at age 14 to work at a printer's, was fascinated by Assyria, and starting in 1860 visited the British Museum to learn all he could. When they noticed his obsession, the museum hired him to piece together the broken tablets, and it was he who first realized that some of the tablets contained the Gilgamesh epic. While working on the tablets, Smith discovered the story of the flood and the ship that ended up on a mountain and made a connection to the Biblical story. In 1872, he gave a talk to the museum in which he associated the flood story with Noah's flood, titling the talk ""The Chaldean History of the Flood."" In the language used to write Gilgamesh, Akkadian often mixed with the older Sumerian, which Akkadian scribes also learned. A character pronounced one way in Akkadian would be pronounced entirely differently in Sumerian. This was why Smith's translation gave Gilgamesh's name as Izdubar (the latter would be the pronunciation if the symbols were Akkadian). Enkidu became Heabani. Smith argued that Gilgamesh is the hunter-king Nimrod who appears in the Bible. But what about all the sex that would surely have left Victorians outraged? There's no sign of it in Smith's early translation: at this point, he was only interested in Biblical connections. For example, of the whole incident with Ishtar and the monstrous bull, Smith only writes ""and then an animal called 'the divine bull' was subdued."" He would also describe what he saw as the Assyrian depictions of heaven, hell, and the immortal soul. 

But don't worry. In 1875, Smith published a much fuller version, *The Chaldean Account of Genesis,* which sold well. He purposely left out some of the more explicit scenes, such as Enkidu's (sorry... Heabani's) seduction by the ""temple harlot,"" claiming he did so ""because they were on the one side obscure, and on the other hand appeared hardly adapted for general reading."" I can't think of a more Victorian dodge than that. There are also several errors in translation: instead of the famous wrestling scene between Gilgamesh and Enkidu, Izdubar wrestles a tiger Heabani brings with him, and Izdubar, not Heabani, is struck down by disease after they kill the giant bull, which makes Heabani's death something of a mystery. (The tiger is a mistranslation from text that had been written across two tablets: the ""Midannu"" beast turns out, when the tablets are connected, to be ""anakumi dannu,"" a boast by Enkidu: ""I alone am mighty."") Smith also takes stories about Ishtar from other sources, including her descent into the underworld, using other Ishtar depictions to gloss over the defiant and scandalous ways Gilgamesh insults Ishtar as he rebuffs her sexual advances towards him. As you might imagine from Smith's framing, reviewers talked almost exclusively about the Biblical connections of Smith's translation, praising their usefulness in helping better understand Biblical stories.

The first popular translation was written by the fantastically-named  Leonidas Le Cenci Hamilton, an American, in 1884. His book, *Ishtar and Izdubar, The Epic of Babylon* turns the story into a sweet romance. Hamilton's adaptation is very loose, transforming the poem into couplets that are sometimes tortured into having the right end rhyme. In Hamilton's poem, Heabani chases the ""maiden"" sent to ""entice"" him, who playfully always slips out of his grasp: ""But he the sport enjoys, and her pursues; / But glancing back his arms she doth refuse.  /And thus three days and four of nights she played; / For of Heabani's love she was afraid. / Her joyous company doth him inspire / For Sam-kha, joy, and love, and wild desire. / He was not satisfied unless her form / Remained before him with her endless charm."" Later, another maiden appears, and Heabani sits wistfully at her feet admiring her: ""And when Heabani saw the rounded form / Of bright Kharim-tu, her voluptuous charm / Drew him to her, and at her feet he sate / With wistful face, resigned to any fate."" Regarding the scenes with Ishtar, the poem describes that her ""love"" for men and animals withers them away, but is vague on what that entails. Hamilton takes Ishtar's ""descent to Hades"" to return her lover Tammuz to life from a completely different poem (the ""Descent of Innana""), and the connection to Greek mythology is clear. As for the death of Heabani, the seer receives his death-blow in a fight with dragons: even as Izdubar strikes down the dragon, the beast sinks its fangs into Heabani. After his long mourning for his friend, Izdubar finds sweet love in the arms of a princess, Mua. The story ends with Izdubar preparing to return from paradise to the world of men, making his tragic farewell to Mua, who chooses to remain ignorant of death in paradise rather than to come with him to a world of mortality and woe. In a second volume that was never written, Izdubar was supposed to eventually find immortality and reconcile with Ishtar. Interestingly, given the other translations around this time, Hamilton leaves out the flood completely. Hamilton's version was rendered obsolete almost immediately by more accurate and complete German translations. He was forced to file for bankruptcy, and died of stomach cancer in 1906. I haven't been able to find any contemporary reviews."
906,AskHistorians,"Did Benjamin Franklin really say ""We need a revolution every 200 years, because all governments become stale and corrupt after 200 years.”?","No. It's difficult to prove a negative, but I can find no solid evidence that Franklin said that. The only places I see it, or any version of it, it appears without any citation. I can find no version of it in a reputable academic source. Additionally, if there was evidence that Franklin had really said something as provocative as that, it would be well known. 

Moreover, this ""quote"" doesn't pass the smell test. The language doesn't sound like it's from the 18th century to me. That's hard to explain, but it's just an instinct. In particular, I don't think Franklin would have used the words ""We need a revolution."" 

Franklin died in April 1790. The basic idea of a ""right of revolution,"" which this quote sort of draws on, was common by then. It's the idea that a free people have a right to abolish an unjust government. The U.S. Declaration of Independence uses this language: ""when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government."" Likewise, in 1787, Jefferson wrote, ""what country can preserve it’s liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? let them take arms. the remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon & pacify them. what signify a few lives lost in a century or two? the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants. it is it’s natural manure.""

But what's missing from those quotes? The word ""revolution."" As historian Keith Baker has argued, that word didn't come to have this meaning of a systemic and collective disruption of a particular form of government until the 1790s, with the French Revolution (which the timing of Franklin's death meant that he mostly missed). Before then, ""revolution"" sometimes referred more to a rotation or change in government (like a reshuffle of the British cabinet, or the death of a monarch). In the era of the Glorious Revolution, the word ""revolution"" referred to something that happened (often with divine intervention) rather than something that human will brought about. In other words, there weren't groups that would self-consciously call themselves ""revolutionaries."" Even in the 1780s, the ""American Revolution"" as a phrase was still developing. So the phrase ""We need a revolution"" would have been out of sync with the predominant understanding of what revolutions were until that started to change during the last few months of Franklin's life. 

In other words, even if this sentiment was not an uncommon one, this use of the word ""revolution"" would have been pretty unusual during Franklin's lifetime. This, in addition to the fact that I'm unable to find evidence for this quote, suggests pretty strongly that this quote is fake. (there are lots of them: check out http://fakefoundersquotes.tumblr.com) 

See Keith Michael Baker, “Revolution 1.0,” Journal of Modern European History 11 (2013).

Quick edit to add: when I did a quick google search for this ""quote,"" I found it on several sites that were attempting to use it for explicitly political purposes. One good rule is that when popular figures from the past such as Franklin are quoted in ways that seem to speak directly to our present or which directly support one's own politics, it's worth being suspicious. (and asking experts to verify a quote is one great way of doing that, of course)"
907,AskHistorians,I'm attached to mercenary Swiss Pike company in the high middle ages. We step through a wormhole and wind up squaring off against a Macedonian phalanx. Forget who wins. Has much changed in the use of a pike? Or are we essentially the same infantry a couple millenia apart?,"There are a few very broad similarities between these two types of infantry. They both represent the response of a relatively poor and remote region to encroachments by powerful military neighbours whose methods it could not afford to adopt. They were both levies of a militarised rural population rather than professional soldiers. They both use long pointy sticks as a way to gain an advantage of reach in close combat, and pair it with tight drill to make large formations of people with long pointy sticks feasible.

But that is really where the similarities end. In terms of their military environment, deployment, and tactical use, these types of infantry are completely different. They didn't serve the same purpose in battle and it doesn't make all that much sense to compare them as potential opponents.

The differences between these troop types stems from the very good reason that they were responses to different situations. The Macedonians during the reign of Philip II (whether he really introduced the pike phalanx is debated, but I'll assume it here for the sake of simplicity) were mainly concerned about their ability to counter heavy infantry. Like many peoples of the Southern Balkans in this time, Macedon had a strong tradition of fielding effective heavy cavalry and light infantry, but did not have an established tradition of specialising in close combat. But many of their local enemies could field strong forces of hoplites - either raised locally like the Chalkidian League, deployed as expeditionary forces like the Athenians, or hired from abroad. The Macedonian pike phalanx was probably introduced as a cheap way to raise effective heavy infantry that could hold its own against hoplites without requiring the same (relatively expensive) arms and armour.

The Swiss pike formation, by contrast, was intended as an answer to mounted knights. Encroachment by the Burgundians and others pushed the Swiss to develop a way to grapple with this dominant tactical arm without sufficient revenues to support that system. Instead of raising their own heavy cavalry, they opted for a flexible force of heavy infantry that would be almost impervious to mounted attack.

The nature of the 2 formations reflects the different purposes they served. In terms of equipment, the Macedonian pikeman clearly started life as a sort of discount hoplite: a smaller shield and longer spear, both cheaper to make than their hoplite counterparts, and much the same (light) armour. As pike phalanxes became prestige forces for Hellenistic kingdoms, their pikes became sophisticated designs allowing maximum reach, and their armour became heavier, but they never lost the shield. Meanwhile the Swiss pikeman started out as a representative of the trend of citizen infantry in the Late Medieval period to carry heavy body armour and high-quality specialist weaponry - just nothing quite as expensive as a warhorse. While the Macedonian *sarisa* got longer and longer in a ""race for reach"" between heavy infantry formations, the Swiss pike mostly kept to a modest length of 5-6m.

In terms of their use on the battlefield, the pike phalanx demonstrates exactly what it meant to function as ersatz hoplites. Their purpose was to present a closed front to the enemy. Even though their internal organisation and officer hierarchy was quite developed, pike units invariably served as a single line, stacked together to form the dependable core of the army in field engagements. Their formations were deeper than those commonly used by hoplites (with normal battle lines 16 or 32 deep), and they were slower, but they performed the same task: advancing directly at the enemy and forcing them to choose between fighting or running away. With this heavy line in place, missile troops and heavy cavalry could operate on the flanks, knowing they had a strong core to fall back on.

Swiss pikemen, on the other hand, were deployed in deep square blocks, manoeuvring independently and acting aggressively to overrun the enemy. There wasn't much else besides them in Swiss armies; missile troops and non-pike infantry was merged in the formation to act against targets of opportunity. The purpose of these blocks was not to maintain a line but to decide the battle as quickly as possible.

I won't speculate about what would happen if such forces met in battle. But the lesson most scholars have drawn from the encounter between the pike phalanx and the legion is that the latter's low-level tactical flexibility gave it an enormous edge against the relatively cumbersome, monolithic phalanx. This is because the phalanx was intended to win pitched battles against similarly monolithic formations - which was not what the Swiss pikeman was for, and which was not how the Swiss pikeman operated."
908,AskHistorians,"I just read that, when they tested the atomic bomb, there was a belief it might light the atmosphere on fire. If they believed this, why did they still test it?","There wasn't much of a belief that this could happen, because it had been considered and refuted by the scientists involved in the development of the first nuclear weapons. [In a 1991 interview with renowned physicist Hans Bethe](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/bethe-teller-trinity-and-the-end-of-earth/) about this very question, he credits Edward Teller as the physicist who first brought up the concern at a 1942 conference in Berkeley. 

>Teller said, ""Well, how about the air?  There's nitrogen in the air, and you can have a nuclear reaction in which two nitrogen nuclei collide and become oxygen plus carbon, and in this process you set free a lot of energy.  Couldn't that happen?""  And that caused great excitement...

>Teller at Los Alamos put a very good calculator on this problem, [Emil] Konopinski, who was an expert on weak interactors, and Konopinski together with [inaudible] showed that it was incredibly impossible to set the hydrogen, to set the atmosphere on fire.  They wrote one or two very good papers on it, and that put the question really at rest.  They showed in great detail why it is impossible.  But, of course, it spooked [Compton].  

Bethe seems to place blame for the popularization of this idea to Arthur Compton, a colleague of his when working on the Manhattan Project. The addendum to the above article contains links to [""The Ultimate Catastrophe""](https://books.google.com/books?id=UwsAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=ultimate+catastrophe+bethe&source=bl&ots=AxizdFopow&sig=Jm3yl_OHCfJFN1uGS8qTUx5UUQg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIru2rgbuNxwIVyhYeCh10vQ0O#v=onepage&q=ultimate%20catastrophe%20bethe&f=false), a 1975 editorial by H.C. Dudley in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists warning of the possibility, as well as a [rebuttal by Bethe published some months later.](https://books.google.com/books?id=WAwAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=compton+pearl+buck+ultimate+catastrophe+bulletin&source=bl&ots=yVVsxTBcqL&sig=w-Hzo-pGqbFq_H4X5WnV7R3lVGo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMI56fZ852PxwIVCHI-Ch2hqg-u#v=onepage&q=compton%20pearl%20buck%20ultimate%20catastrophe%20bulletin&f=false) ""The Ultimate Catastrophe"" references [this 1959 interview](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph241/chung1/docs/buck.pdf) of Arthur Compton on the matter. In his 1956 *Atomic Quest: A Personal Narrative*, he provides his own detailed perspective, but ultimately concedes that the fears had been laid to rest.

>These questions could not be passed over lightly. Was there really any chance that an atomic bomb would trigger the explosion of the nitrogen in the atmosphere or of hydrogen in the ocean? This would be the ultimate catastrophe...

>In due time, the calculations gave the firm result that while the nuclei of hydrogen and nitrogen are indeeed unstable, the conditions under which they can explode are far removed from anything that can be brought about by atomic explosions. (p. 127)

In *Memoirs: A Twentieth Century Journey in Science and Politics*, Teller refers to the 1942 conference where the prospect of runaway atmospheric fusion was dismissed as a statistical impossibility. Enrico Fermi brought the subject up again in 1945 on the eve of the famous Trinity test, the first detonation of an nuclear weapon. Teller, among other scientists, once again performed the calculations necessary to show that such a catastrophe could not occur.

>But when we had completed our proof, Fermi insisted that we go one step further. All we had proved, he pointed out, was that such an explosion could not occur according to known laws of physics. But what presently undiscovered phenomena might exist that, under the novel conditions of extreme heat, might magnify the consequences and lead to an explosion? (p. 210)

Teller admitted that this question occupied his mind in the weeks leading up to the test, but it was at this point more of a curiosity than a genuine concern. "
909,AskHistorians,"I'm a Jewish man in 1946 recently liberated from a death camp. My home has been destroyed by the war, all my friends and family have been eradicated, I have no money or possessions and all records of me have been destroyed. What do I do and who can I turn to for help?","Ok, so initially there's a bit of a grey area when you talk about ""liberated,"" because liberation wasn't something that happened overnight.  Camps were liberated at different times, and in some cases retreating Nazi forces made deliberate efforts to clean out the camps or prisoners prior to surrendering them. Allied liberated camps had different outcomes than soviet camps etc. 

Because it's the easiest example, imagine you were a jewish man at Buchenwald or the Ohrdruf sub-camp, one of the earlier camps liberated by the allies.    The easiest thing to do is just walk you through the rough timeline. 

Allied forces take control of the Buchenwald camp on April 5, 1945 after german forces retreat from the area. 
 
Based on numerous concerns, Allied military officers have inmates of the camp stay ""incarcerated."" until they can be medically stabalized and a determination can be made on what to do with them.  The allies do bring in medical personnel and food supplies to begin treating the prisoners. For the first several weeks, hundreds of prisoners would continue to die daily.  Gradually conditions improved in the camps, although only to a point. 


 For our hypothetical prisoner from Buchenwald, you probably continue to live at Buchenwald for another 2-3 months perhaps, being fed allied military rations and being treated by allied doctors. you'll slowly regain some semblance of health  

After the war ended the Allied Command faced the monumental task of repatriating some 7 million displaced persons within Europe. This included both Ethnic Germans that had settled in other parts of Europe as well as concentration camp survivors, refugees and others.  Allied policy was generally to attempt to repatriate as many of these persons as possible.   However, because the task could not be accomplished instantly, [displaced persons camps were established in europe](http://www.dpcamps.org/dpcampseurope.html) these were refugee camps intended to house displaced persons, which included holocaust survivors as well as eastern Europeans.  

On October 1, 1945, the [United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Relief_and_Rehabilitation_Administration) is formally given legal control over the displaced persons program. However, the UNRRA is widely seen as having been under-staffed and under funded, and conditions in DP camps often were poor at best. 
  
 Based on allied and UNRRA policy, once you were healthy, would be moved to a ""displaced persons"" camp to be repatriated to your country of origin probably sometime between July and November 1945.   If you were Jewish you would most likely be moved into a camp in the US controlled section of occupied germany.  The UNRRA to avoid charges of discrimination, specifically [did not create any special policies towards jewish displaced persons](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/usarmy_holo.html)   However, this was later changed and jewish survivors were given some special accomodations in terms of being grouped together. 

Those displaced persons would could be repatriated (germans, western europeans,  and the like) were quickly repatriated, leaving the bulk of the persons in DP camps to be eastern Europeans (Poles, Ukranians etc) and jews who could not be repatriated to their countries of origin.   Particularly if you were from an area that was now occupied by the Russians, you aren't likely to be forced to return. 

Rather, you will have at least a temporarily uncertain future, and will continue to live in the displaced persons camp in occupied germany for a number of months or years.   You are likely living in housing built by the US military or UNRRA, and fed by either US military or UNRRA personnel.  Conditions are poor at best, and downright abysmal at worst, with refugees living in cramped overcrowded housing and being fed insufficient food. 

Gradually, private aid agencies will step in to provide solutions to the problems, but they had limited impact. Many of these private aid agencies were juewish centric agencies. 


Conditions were made worse by further refugees fleeing soviet bloq countries. Between 1945 and 1948 there was an even larger percentage of Jewish refugees coming into DP camps, to the point where in 1948, an allied military commander closed the borders to further refugees, although the orders were not ironclad and many continued to come.   [This is a review of a book on the refugee crisis after WWII in general](http://www.salon.com/2011/03/01/the_long_road_home_ben_shephard/) 

At this point, you get along basically in a similar way as any other refugee anywhere gets along.  Black market Micro-economies spring up in refugee camps based both on rations and on markets within the camps themselves. Cigarettes and Chocolate and rations are common currencies. If you have a marketable skill you perhaps try to earn some side income.  Prostitution was not an uncommon source of income.  You rely on others in the camp and established new networks for support.  

Over time, many left the camps, but opportunities were somewhat limited and covert. Jewish groups started moving jewish residents into Israel at this point, but due to a British prohibition on settlement on palestine they often had to be smuggled (although, much like today, it was not terribly difficult). 

The big sea change was in May  1948, two significant things happened 

1. [the US senate passed the  Wiley-Revercomb  Displaced Persons Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displaced_Persons_Act) this allowed 100,000 displaced persons to gain permanent residence in the United States. 

2. In may 1948 the state of Israel was established, and immigration was opened to every person of Jewish Descent. (the return act wasn't formally passed until 1950, but once Israel was recognized, people could travel there openly) About 130,000 remaining displaced persons emigrated to Israel within the first three years of Israeli statehood, many were assisted by Zionist groups. 



Again, for our hypothetical resident from Buchenwald, you've probably moved to a DP camp somewhere in the American Zone of Germany. You have limited opportunity and limited resources. Perhaps if you can find gainful employment, or have family somewhere, you've gotten out before now, but if you truly have nothing, you're probably still in a DP camp by 1947 or early 1948. 

At this point, options become available. Per the above, you can scrounge together whatever savings you can beg, borrow and steal, and try to apply for a US visa and get on a boat to New York, or you can go to a Zionist group, and they will arrange for transport to the newly formed state of Israel. By the late 1940's to 1950, most of the camps had been emptied.

910,AskHistorians,The US Government Has Not Successfully Prosecuted A Major Antitrust Case Since the United States v. AT&T in 1984. Why is this?,"There is a flawed premise in your question: A settlement does not necessarily indicate a prosecution was unsuccessful.  A defendant that knows they are likely to lose has a huge incentive to settle, and the government may extract from a favorable settlement much of the relief it would seek at trial without the time, expense, and risk of going through that process.  Focusing on the tech sector as an example (as it's called out in the OP), the DOJ obtained consent decrees against a variety tech companies in *US v. Adobe*, prohibiting the challenged conduct (non-solicitation agreements related to certain employees).

Aside from this, the DOJ and FCC have pursued antitrust cases successfully across several industries over the past several years.  The packaged seafood, capacitors, and freight forwarding investigations, for example, have each resulted in recent, criminal convictions. 

It's therefore not correct to say there has been no major, successful antitrust case.  Rather, your question seems to be focused specifically on prosecutions (a) based on anticompetitive monopolistic conduct (i.e., a Section 2 case); (b) against a major conglomerate; and (c) that resulted in a breakup--one of the most drastic remedies.  But it's important to keep in mind that being a monopoly doesn't violate the antitrust law; it's using anticompetitive means to obtain or maintain a monopoly that is proscribed.

So why has this specific kind of case not been brought?  Perhaps there are instances where they should have been.  But these cases are expensive to bring and tough to win.  Investigations take years and extraordinary numbers of man hours.  In addition, the past several decades have seen antitrust law increasingly focus on consumer welfare, which has tended to permit greater vertical integration and exacerbate the expense and difficulties of winning these cases.  There have also been significant decisions that have narrowed the kinds of conduct that can be successfully prosecuted, with cases like *Trinko* narrowing refusal to deal liability and more sophisticated economic showings being demanded for predatory price theories. Finally, certain administrations have deprioritized antitrust enforcement--or at least reprioritized it in different areas.  For all these reasons, major Section 2 cases have been less frequent in recent years.

That said, it's not entirely fair to say the US government has seemed unwilling to prosecute large tech companies.  As has been widely reported, the DOJ has spent years investigating tech giants and is said to be preparing indictments against at least some of them (e.g., https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html).  Will that be another ""case of the century"" in which they seek to break up Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, or someone else?  Stay tuned."
911,AskHistorians,What do we know because of the Dead Sea Scrolls that we wouldn't have known otherwise?,"We've learned such a huge amount of things, both large and small, that I'm sure I'm going to forget a number of them. But here goes:

1) On the most macro level, the earliest complete Hebrew manuscripts of the Bible that we have are in the Leningrad Codex of 1008 CE, which was copied closer to us than to the original creation of the Bible. Our closest complete copy in another language (Greek) is in the Codices Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, which are from the around the 4th-5th centuries CE. Questions started popping up regarding the reliability of the Bible––if all our Bibles are using a Hebrew translation that dates to a thousand years ago, and the text was originally written between ~2150-3000 years ago, how are we to know that we're even reading the right thing?

When the Scrolls were discovered and dated (using Paleography, C-14, and Mass Spectrometry) to between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st century CE (some are older, some newer), we were finally able to see if the text we had was relatively reliable. In most cases, on the macro scale, it is. There are a ton of minor textual variants (sentences, words, etc.), but you won't see the copies of Exodus saying that Pharaoh actually killed Moses and led the people out of Israel himself, if you catch my meaning. So on that level, we learned a lot about the transmission of the Bible.

2) We learned a ton about the variants of Second Temple Jews. While there's still scholarly debate on who exactly wrote the Scrolls (another question for another time), the general consensus is that it was the Essenes, of whom Josephus spoke. With the discovery of the Community Rule document, we got the smallest details of the way these people operated, including their initiation rites, their day to day rules, the way they used their money, and the way they interacted with each other.

3) The Scrolls have been a huge discovery in terms of the development of canon. For those who say the canon was closed since its original creation, the Scrolls have both supported some of their claims and muddied up the waters a bit. In terms of supporting the canon, we see that, as far back as the 3rd-2nd century BCE, the general outline of the Hebrew Bible was similar to today. They had the ""writings of Moses"" (Pentateuch), ""The Prophets"" (the major and minor prophets of our Bible), and the ""Writings"" (Wisdom literature and other assorted things like Job). We also have scrolls that contain both Genesis and Exodus, others with Exodus and Leviticus, Leviticus and Numbers, Numbers and Deuteronomy, so we know that they were thought of as a unit at that time. We also know that these books, along with the Psalms, were the most important to this group: there are about 40 copies of Psalms, 35 of Genesis, and similar amounts for the others, followed by a sizeable drop off when it comes to other books. For instance, there's only one of Ezra, none of Esther, and many others in the single digits.

How did it muddy up the canon? Among the most frequently found books are the Book of Jubilees and the Book of Enoch, indicating that these, too, were considered sacred, and more sacred than the majority of non-Pentateuchal books. Their writings frequently invoke ideas from the Book of Enoch and the book of Jubilees, and their calendar seemed to run by that of Jubilees.

4) We discovered a number of methods of biblical interpretation that are extremely interesting, and predate Midrash and Talmud. One method is the Pesher, in which verses from the Bible are laid out and the interpreter writes, one by one, how each verse applies to their modern situation (they were heavy into eschatology, believing there was going to be a massive war between the forces of good and evil). The other was in the form of pseudepigrapha–stories written from the point of view of a famous biblical character, that retell or expand on their story in order to smooth out some issues with the text. For a good example, I'd suggest the Genesis Apocryphon.

5) I don't know quite how to put this next one, except to say that they operated, literarily, in a very bizarre way. Part of the reason that they weren't particularly easy to date was that they never use proper names. They only use code names, and there are a number of characters that show up. Their initial leader, whom they see as something of a prophet, is only known as the Teacher of Righteousness. There's also the Man of the Lie, the Wicked Priest (his enemy), Those Who Speak Smooth Things, and a number of others that I can't recall offhand. The Teacher of Righteousness is thought to have written a number of the nonbiblical scrolls, most notably the Thanksgiving Hymns, which are a collection of really beautiful psalm-style poems. I really suggest reading them.

6) For Christians who are interested in the context that Jesus came out of, the Scrolls set the stage for a lot of things that appear in the New Testament. The New Jerusalem Text and Temple Scroll will remind you of Revelation, and a number of narrative devices (""fount of living water"" for one) will look familiar. That's NOT to say that the Dead Sea sect were early Christians, or that Jesus was an Essene (though some people have argued weakly), but it simply shows some context. Personally, given the style and the narrative devices, I do think that Johannine christianity may have come out of a Jewish context that had some kind of influence from this group (for more on that, you can read a number of books and conference proceedings on Qumran and John), though that's as far as I'll go on that matter.

I'm missing a million things here. We learned so many little things from the Dead Sea Scrolls, along with the big things, that it literally takes whole books to explain. The best book, easiest to understand, that I've come across is The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls, by Flint and Vanderkam. That's where I got all of this information.

Hope this helps!

Edit: Minor textual changes, just like the Scrolls themselves.

Edit 2: Bonus fun fact: if you're looking for a very specific example of something that we didn't know that we know now, here's one. There's a moment in 1 Samuel 11, in which a character behaves very strangely. Nahash the Ammonite makes peace with the Israelites, and one verse later gouges out everyone's right eye for seemingly no reason. This has puzzled a lot of commentators. However, scroll 4QSam-a (4=Cave 4, Q=Qumran, Sam=Samuel, a=fragment A) has an additional verse that explains Nahash's behaviour (though he still comes off as a horrible tyrant): he liked gouging people's eyes out and the Israelites had escaped and conglomerated in the city that he oppresses in the following verse. Now, the NRSV translation, which is the one used by most academic scholars, includes that verse that was originally missing. So that's a very tangible example of things we learn from the Scrolls for you.

912,AskHistorians,"""Slavery was not put into practice because of racial theories; racial theories sprang up in the wake of slavery, so to justify it"" (Richard Wright). How true is this for colonial Africa? Did the West have racial preconceptions before colonising Africa?","[1/2]

I'm going to talk about three levels to this question.

The first is just a brief note. The term ""colonial Africa"" usually refers to the era of European imperialism in the 19th and 20th centuries, when western European powers conquered and controlled (or claimed to control) nearly all of the African continent as part of their empires. It's true that Latin Europe was in contact with sub-Saharan Africa from the 15th century, and that Portugal controlled various islands and Jesuits ministered at the courts of the Kongo and Ethiopia from an early date as well. But ""colonialism"" in the sense of the 16th century Americas is, generally speaking, a much later crime against Africa. We can all agree, I think, that by the mid-19th century (you know, the *American Civil War*), ideas of white/black race were *well* formed.

Okay, boring one's done.

Second, Wright draws this particular idea in *Black Power* (1954) from a debate that was boiling over in the 1950s. It concerned, specifically, the origins of black slavery in British North America. The presence of black Africans is attested in Virginia from 1619, but the earliest unambiguous references to slavery (in the sense of permanent ownership of another human being) come decades later. Until the turn of the 20th century, it was accepted, it was *obvious*, that slavery and black people arrived in North America at the same time. That is to say, white people looked at other white people and saw indentured servants; they looked at black people and saw slaves. There was pre-existing racial prejudice that resulted in the enslavement of black Africans and their American descendants.

Scholars like James Ballagh, John Russell, and Ulrich Phillips spent the early decades of the 20th century going back to the sources--like good Rankean historians!--and poking holes in some of the foundational ideas here. In fact, the question of the servitude/enslavement status of early Africans in the NA colonies *is* ambiguous; plus, scholars of this era continued to register their surprise over how many *free* black people (Africans and eventually African-Americans) were attested in early 17C sources. Slavery was the norm and, more to the point, enshrined in law by the 1660s, but until the 30s or 40s there was a lot of ambiguity.

Though 1940, though, no one had really made the argument that slavery of blacks versus servitude of whites catalyzed the institutionalization of racism against black people in North America. Eric Williams's 1944 *Capitalism and Slavery,* which is most likely Wright's immediate source (""Slavery was not born of racism; rather racism was the consequence of slavery""), made the argument explicitly but, it must be said, not very extensively. For Williams, the debate over the nature of the racism-slavery connection was a minor stepping-stone of his overall argument about imperialism actually being a bad thing, thank you very much.

It was Oscar and Mary Handlin in 1950 who did the first major *historical* work flipping the standard racism=>slavery paradigm. They argued, that slavery in British North America was a separate institution from earlier and contemporary systems of slavery, that it evolved out of the various levels of servitude in contemporary English society, and--most relevantly for our purposes here--that the factors leading white landowners to single out black Africans as ""slaves"" while whites maintained limited periods of indentured servitude arose out of *perceived difference* (culture, geographic origins, language, appearance) that was *not yet racism.* The legal entrenchment of black slavery over the 1660s and 70s plus the day-in, day-out experience of white people witnessing the practical and normative degredation of their black neighbors inculcated the pernicious notion of superiority on the most obvious of measures: skin color.

As OP has gathered from reading Wright and the rest of you can grok from a quick wiki of Williams and Wright, the argument that the economic choice of slavery created racism (not prejudice or difference, but *racism*) was extremely timely and attractively on the brink of the U.S. civil rights movement and anticolonial revolts (Williams was eventually PM of Trinidad and Tobago). White and black people had been equal in freedom and servitude in the earliest years of Eastern Hemisphere domination of Native American land; there was nothing *inherently better* about white people in a biological or patriotic sense. Racism against black people became, in light of this argument, a later guest that had overstayed its welcome and--critically--could be asked to leave.

Scholarly mudslinging that followed aside, the seminal work on the topic (though there are piles and piles and PILES of subsequent books and articles, make no mistake) is still Winthrop Jordan's 1968 *White Over Black: American Attitudes Towards the Negro, 1550-1812*.  This book was not the first, and it would be by NO means the last, to lay out a massive information overload of all the really crappy things white people had written about and done to black people before ""official"" slavery.

The Handlins and Jordan, in other words, agreed that Europeans saw black people as different than them. Jordan argued that the ""difference"" was bitter, hateful, and deeply invested with ideas of European/white superiority and African/black inferiority even before slavery. He further argued that, while black slavery was indeed a later comer to North American soil, the British ""obviously"" adopted Caribbean/Latin American slavery as their model.

*And yet*.

Jordan still distinguished between race-based hatred that was ideological and race-based hatred that was institutionalized in law. ""Rather than slavery causing prejudice, or vice versa,"" he wrote, ""they seem rather
to have generated each other.""

Ah, good old-fashioned scholarly equivocation, you might say. Or rather: recognition of two key points. First, the situation is enormously messy. Second, one's position on it comes in large part down to how one defines terms like prejudice, race, and racism. Alden Vaughan has a *forty-five page* historiography article on the origins of Euro-colonized North American slavery and the relationship to racism, and a full two-thirds of it is scholars taking very well-sourced, well-argued, and often really interesting shots at each other (resistance to ""enslaving"" black Christians even when legally permissible/required) when basic real difference is, what counts as ""difference"" versus ""prejudice"" versus ""racism.""

Americanists have typically been content to leave the story here, starting in 1619 Virginia with a nice prehistory in Tudor England. But as my medievalist and classicist counterparts on AskHistorians can tell you, the ""search for the origins of racism"" has become a minor scholarly obsession in our fields. For some reason, everyone wants to claim their era as the time when hatred based on religious practice and ideas of xenophobia, which are demonstrably ancient (when I am feeling peckish, my favorite example is the beloved Parable of the Good Samaritan, whose engine is prejudice--the Galilean Jews' prejudice against the Samaritans; the *parable author's* prejudice against observant Jews) turned into ""racism"" or prejudice and legal discrimination based on inherited group biological characteristics.

913,AskHistorians,Bill James said that Donald Trump is the most crude and vulgar President since Harry Truman. What about Truman was so vulgar and did he have a reputation for being particularly uncouth among his contemporaries?,"> [T]hings will be in such shape in
foreign affairs that we can go to work in
earnest on that bunch of ‘hypocrites’ known
as Republicans.

> *-the President in a letter to the First Lady, 23 July 1948*

...And let's remember: this is a man who knew with absolutely confidence that his letters would be saved and become very, very public. In fact, he was upset when he discovered she was burning her own copies: ""Think of history!"" he reportedly said.

I can't speak to the intervening presidents of the ""since"" part of James' quotes. But yes, Truman had a temper and was not always keen to hold it back. At least once, First Lady Bess Truman physically yanked Harry back into their shared hotel room to keep him from exploding at the wrong people at the wrong time. 

Even better, according to then-White House seamstress Lillian Parks, people started to joke about how often Bess had to tell her husband, ""You didn't have to say that.""

It's not all fun and games. In 1945, Bess accepted an invitation to an event hosted by the DAR (Daughters of the American Revolution) at a Washington venue that barred Black people. Including, at one point, prohibiting a performance by jazz pianist Hazel Scott, who happened to be the wife of a congressman (NY rep Adam Clayton Powell). Powell complained to Harry about Bess's acceptance of an invitation from this organization--to which Harry promptly vowed never to let Powell set foot in his White House again. 

You do *not* mess with that man's family!

...And this, perhaps, is the most important lesson of all. Because:

In his article, though, James was almost certainly referring to Harry Truman's letter to a certain Paul Hume of the *Washington Post*.

There's some context here. Hume was not the first music critic to give Harry's daughter Margaret less than Grammy-level credit for her singing. St. Louis papers judged her first public performances ""well-produced but not always impeccable in tone"" and ""not a great voice, perhaps not even a truly good one, but it is used expertly and with considerable artistry.""

But Hume went a little too far for the president's taste, and he, shall we say, *responded.*

> I've just read your lousy review of [Harry's daughter] Margaret's concert. I've come to the conclusion that you are an ""eight ulcer man on four ulcer pay.""

> It seems to me that you are a frustrated old man who wishes he could have been successful. When you write such poppy-cock as was in the back section of the paper you work for it shows conclusively that you're off the beam and at least four of your ulcers are at work. 

> Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below! Pegler, a gutter snipe, is a gentleman alongside you. I hope you'll accept that statement as a worse insult than a reflection on your ancestry.

Truman was apparently no stranger to writing such, shall we say, *eloquent* letters. But the Hume letter was widely published, becoming by far the most in/famous example. One can only imagine how Bess phrased that particular moment's version of ""You didn't have to say that.""

And so we say of Missouri: Act first, apologize second, ask permission third.

Or sometimes just act."
914,AskHistorians,Why did former Chinese coins have a squared hole in the center? Was it just for the purpose of making it harder to produce and counterfeit them or did it serve another purpose as well?,"There are, broadly speaking, two techniques for making coins. The first, which is the most common in the world today, and traditionally used in Europe and India, is **striking**. This involves taking a metal piece, known as a flan, placing it between one or two dies (hard metal stamps bearing images), and applying force with a hammer or, since the 16th century, a screw press. The second, which was used in East Asia but occasionally in the Mediterranean, is **casting**. Casting involves creating a mould, reusable or otherwise, into which molten metal is poured. Once the metal cools down, the mould is separated and the coins removed.

Both techniques have their advantages and drawbacks. Striking traditionally required more human labour, while casting was less energy-efficient, because the metal needed to be melted down rather than simply heated (and indeed whether Greek and Roman coins were even heated at all before striking has been debated). Casting also is less efficient with material, as you need to produce channels in the mould for the molten metal to run down, which will also be filled by metal – these channels, and the cooled metal that ends up in them, are known as sprues. In addition, moulds always have thin gaps in them which some molten metal will escape into, leading to some material protruding from the seam where the halves of the mould meet, known as **flash**, which in the case of metal can be sharp and make the cast objects unpleasant to handle without further finishing. As such, the edges of cast coins need to be filed down in order to remove this flash. (Put a pin in that last part.)

The end results are also different. Before screw presses and milling, casting could produce much more consistent quality than striking, but the quality of the images was much better on struck coins for metallurgical reasons that I won't get into here. One extra feature of cast coins (pre-screw presses) is that they can be made in somewhat unusual shapes, such as to have a hole in the middle. And here's where we go back to the pin. The square hole could be used to fit an axle which could be fitted to a lathe, so that the rough edges of the coins could be smoothed down in bulk.

As for the strings, while I'm not sure about when those came into use, certainly by the Qing period it was quite standard practice, owing to the relatively low value of individual copper coins. A standard 'string' 串 *chuan* was about 1000 coins, give or take, but for more everyday purposes a 'hang' 吊 *diao* of ~100 was more common. Even so, if you were going out for a meal you probably wouldn't even need that. Bear in mind that prices rose over the course of the dynasty, but during the Kangxi reign (1661-1722) typical costs were 10 coins for a bowl of noodles, 4 for a side dish and 2 for a pot of tea. I don't know if David Hartill is using 'strings' as a shorthand for '1000', but it's possible mints assessed their output in 'strings' as well.

As for their being tied together for use as charms, that's an area where I don't know the origins, but certainly it was in use by the Qing period.

915,AskHistorians,"I often hear that ""the Reagan administration shut down mental institutions and released the mentally ill into the streets."" Is this an accurate assessment of the situation, and if not, what is the real story?","**Short answer:**

""It's more complicated than that"". Deinstitutionalization was underway long before the Reagan Administration, for good reasons. The notion was that the mentally ill previously held in large State institutions would receive care in their community, a more humane solution made possible in part by advances in medication.   Reagan has two roles in the problems of deinstitutionalization: as Governor of California (1967 to 1975) and as President (1981 to 1989); as Governor he, like other Governors, oversaw the dismantling of the State Hospitals. As President, he pushed responsibility for mental health policy from Washington DC to the States-- which weren't equipped to handle it.

**Discussion**

When does the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill begin, and why?

The peak institutionalized population was in 1955-- approximately 550,000 patients in mental institutional around the US, at a time when the US population was 165 million, roughly one in every 300 Americans. In 2019, with a population twice the size of 1955, we have roughly 110,000 patients institutionalized -- roughly a %90 reduction in the percentage of the population institutionalized.

The motivations behind deinstitutionalization were generally laudable. It's not coincidental that its also in 1955 that the first antipsychotic medication, Chlorpromazine \[""Thorazine""\], comes on the market in the US and within a few years is prescribed in large quantities. Just as drugs were emptying the tuberculosis sanatoria, there was the prospect that they might empty the asylums. That couldn't come too soon, because the asylums were terrible: a series of exposes had alerted the public and Congress to the sometimes dire conditions in these State hospitals. Ken Kesey wrote ""One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" \[1962\] about his experiences as an orderly in California mental hospital the 1950s, asylums were denounced as ""bedlams"" by the American Psychiatric Association, later Willowbrook was a national scandal:

>The Willowbrook  State School, located in Staten Island, New York City, was a squalid dumping ground for 5,400 profoundly mentally retarded children and adults. .  .Naked bodies could be  found sprawling on concrete floors; some residents seemed to live in soiled  clothing; toilets didn't work, feces were everywhere, and the stench was  unbearable. The physical plant was dilapidated, the interior filthy beyond  imagination. Disease-especially hepatitis and shigella-was rampant.  Medical care was inadequate, therapy largely nonexistent. 

New psychotropic drugs gave the possibility that some patients previously thought to be incapable of living outside an institution might be released to less restrictive community based organizations. Hard to justify keeping someone locked up in a miserable institution, when the prospect of medication and release to the community seemed so much more humane (and so much cheaper).

Federal legislation to accomplish this goal included the Community Mental Health Act of 1963, a part of John F. Kennedy's ""New Frontier"" social programs; he was reportedly particular sensitive to the issue based on the experiences of his sister. This policy had an immediate and dramatic effect

>In his message Kennedy set a quantitative target for  this effort: a reduction by 50% or more of the number of patients then under  custodial care, within ten or twenty years . In reality, the  process of ""deinstitutionalization"" proceeded even more quickly and more  extensively than that. By 1975, the number of patients in state and county  mental hospitals had declined by 62% from the time of the President's  message (65% from the peak of 559,000 in 1955). Falling further still over the  next decade, the institutional census contracted to 110,000 in 1985 (NIMH  1989) despite growth in the US population and irrespective of the increasing  number of mental hospital admissions over much of this period.

**Reagan the Governor and Reagan the President**  
Ronald Reagan dealt with mental health issues more directly as Governor than as President, and California was in the midst of a major deinstitutionalization movement. This wasn't perceived of a bad thing at the time; in 1967 Governor Reagan signed the bipartisan Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, a modern mental health statute with laudable goals, it sought to “end the inappropriate, indefinite, and involuntary commitment of persons with mental health disorders.”

This was considered -- and objectively is-- a progressive statute, very much in keeping with the objectives President Kennedy set out earlier in the decade. What it meant in practice is that involuntary commitment became very difficult . . . the spectacle of the mentally ill on the street became common, in California as it did everywhere.

So Governor Reagan is not unlike other Governors-- one can argue that he had less interest in community health services than did, say, Nelson Rockefeller, and certainly could not compare to Jimmy Carter-- but the basic policy was one which most people thought was good.

What about as President?  There a more specific charge of indifference and policy vandalism can be laid. Very simply, the notion of deinstitutionalization only makes sense if there is some supportive community based mental health services to discharge patients *to* \- even in the best scenarios it proved hard to assure that the mentally ill got the medications they were supposed to (and didn't get the illicit drugs that worsened their conditions) when discharged to the community.

The Reagan Administration made things worse through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which repealed President Carter's  Mental Health Systems Act, depriving the community based health organizations of the funding they needed to support the deinstitutionalized. The Administration's actions caused trouble not so much by ""shut\[ting\] down mental institutions and releas\[ing\] the mentally ill into the streets""  -- but more by drying up the funds that were supposed to support the mentally ill who were being deinstitutionalized.

The hospitals were run by the States, not by the Federal government-- so Administration action couldn't really ""empty"" institutions they didn't control. What they could and did do was fail to provide funding needed to make deinstitutionalization work. And, critically, the States didn't have the policy capacity --nor the political inclination- to design a system of community mental health services.

This was the issue that President Carter had worked on, and where a solution now existed, and in which President Reagan had no interest and consequently scrapped. Leadership matters, and the greatest failing of President Reagan in this regard is that having had the experience of running Sacramento, when he got to Washington -- what did he do? Punted the problem to States and localities that he knew or should have known didn't have the capacity to generate policy on their own.

Writing in 1988, Searight and Handal made an observation that still holds true today, a rather bitter irony of just how far policy *hasn't* gone, and look to the funding programs, rather than a deinstitutionalizing agenda per se as the root of the problems

>It is of interest that the deinstitutionalization movement of the last 30 years has essentially recreated the conditions immediately preceding the construction of psychiatric asylums in the mid-nineteenth century. After a 100-150 year hiatus, the mentally ill have rejoined the aged and physically disabled in nursing homes, alcohol and drug abusers in SROs, and the unemployed and poor among the homeless. The reliance upon Medicaid and SSI programs not specifically developed for the mentally ill but rather for a heterogeneous dependent population for the funding of psychiatric deinstitutionalization has contributed significantly to this state of affairs

917,AskHistorians,I am a soldier who dies while on Crusade. How does my family find out?,">“He is dead, dead, and the world and everything that is sweet in the world is dead to me!” 

This was the reaction of St. Elisabeth of Thuringia when her husband, Ludwig IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, died during Emperor Frederick II’s crusade in 1227. In this case he didn’t actually die on the crusade, he died in Italy before they departed, but Louis’ men brought his bones home with them, along with the ring that he used to seal his documents. As he had promised to Elisabeth before he left, if his ring came back but he did not, it would be proof that he had died. 

Elisabeth was later declared a saint and these details are taken from a hagiography that was written about her, so some of it might be a bit imaginary. But it contains elements that would have been familiar to other family members of dead crusaders from all over Europe: someone, a friend or another family member, brought news back home, and perhaps a piece of physical evidence that the dead crusader had left behind.

Even going all the way back to the First Crusade, crusaders were very often members of the same family. Whether they were noble counts and dukes, or simple knights, we often see fathers and sons, two or more brothers, or cousins all going on crusade together. The first king of Jerusalem, Godfrey of Bouillon, went on crusade with his brothers (Baldwin and Eustace of Boulogne), as well as a cousin, Baldwin of Bourcq. Another one of Baldwin of Bourcq’s cousins, Joscelin of Courtenay, was also present on the crusade. There are countless other examples…Warner and Henry of Grez are another set of brothers from the First Crusade. From the Fifth Crusade, I know of two brother knights, who are otherwise completely unknown to history - Alexander and Assein of Archiac, a small village in western France. 

So, family members often went on crusade together. Sometimes even their wives and children went with them!  If one of them died, the others could easily inform their relatives, whenever they eventually returned home. 

Often we don’t know how a family was informed, but we know how they reacted. Ida of Louvain’s husband Baldwin II of Hainault disappeared during the First Crusade. His body was never found, and although everyone was sure he had died, Ida insisted on travelling to the east in person to search for her husband herself. She never found him either, but this is evidence, at least, that someone had returned to Hainault and told her what happened.

Another way to inform relatives was to send a letter, as you mentioned in the question. Anselm of Ribemont sent [a letter](https://history.hanover.edu/texts/1stcrusade1.html) to Manasses, the Archbishop of Reims during the First Crusade in 1098, listing some of the men who had died over the previous two years. There are only a handful of names in the letter, so it’s certainly not a complete list, but they were probably the men that Anselm and the archbishop knew personally, and whose families Manasses could inform back home:

>“I ask, moreover, that you and all whom this letter reaches pray for us and for our departed brethren. Those who have fallen in battle are: at Nicaea, Baldwin of Ghent, Baldwin Ghalderuns, who was the first to make an attack upon the Turks and who fell in battle on the Kalends of July, Robert of Paris, Lisiard of Flanders, Hilduin of Mansgarbio \[Maxingarbe\], Ansellus of Caium \[Anseau of Caien\], Manasses of Glaromonte \[Clermont\], Laudunensis. Those who died from sickness: at Nicaea, Guy of Vitreio, Odo of Vernolio \[Verneuil (?)\], Hugh of Reims; at the fortress of Sparnum, the venerable abbot Roger, my chaplain; at Antioch, Alard of Spiniaeco Hugh of Galniaco.”

While Ludwig of Thuringia’s bones were brought back home, another possibility for dead crusaders was to be buried in the east. When they died in battle, their bodies might have to be left on the field, exposed to the elements, or they might have to be buried in a mass grave; but sometimes they could be buried in a distinct tomb. This was the case with the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I, who died during the Third Crusade in 1190 and was buried in Antioch. Sometimes, the families of the dead crusader might come looking for their remains, and their bones could be brought back home to Europe - so, here again, this is evidence that someone must have returned home and told them that not only that their relatives had died, but also where they were buried. 

As you also mentioned, it's possible that some families just never heard from their relatives again. If a minor knight or foot soldier died on crusade, but no one knew them or no one knew how to contact their families, their family back home might never know that they died. But at least among the wealthier knights and nobles, they definitely had a network of family connections, which made it easier for people back home to learn what happened.

My main source for this is Nicholas L. Paul, *To Follow in their Footsteps: The Crusades and Family Memory in the High Middle Ages* (Cornell University Press, 2012)."
918,AskHistorians,"How did Nazi (or any anti-semetic) Christians view the Old Testament, given that pretty much exclusively follows the history of the Jewish people?","The Nazis essentially did mental gymnastics to avoid the Jewish roots of Christianity (and of course, the Nazi's relationship with Christianity can be an entire new question to be covered). Perhaps the most absurd way that they tackled this was through the claim that ""Jesus was not a Jew"". Rather, they claimed (although not an original idea to them specifically) he was of Aryan descent, paternally descended from members of the Roman Legion who had come to the region. The roots of this theory come from the [tradition](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5nr9nf/how_did_nazi_or_any_antisemetic_christians_view/dcea8k8?context=3) that Jesus was, in the words of Hitler, the product of ""a whore and a Roman soldier"", but other theorists changed the generation and noted his grandfather to have been the Legionnaire. The inseey-weensy tiny detail that, you know, the whole point is that Jesus is the son of God, and has no earthly father, is elided over. Anyways though, his Jewish roots dispensed with, Jesus can now be set up as an anti-Jewish crusader, as described here by Hitler:

>For the Galilean's object was to liberate His country from Jewish oppression. He set Himself against Jewish capitalism, and that's why the Jews liquidated Him.

The 'perversion' of Jesus' doctrine is laid at the feet of Paul, a 'sick brain', for ""purposes of personal exploitation"", what he terms at a different time ""mobilis[ing] the criminal underworld [to] organise a proto-Bolshevism"". During his monologue, Hitler goes further, contrasting the Romans and the Jews:

>The religious ideas of the Romans are common to all Aryan peoples. The Jew, on the other hand, worshipped and continues to worship, then and now, nothing but the golden calf. The Jewish religion is devoid of all metaphysics and has no foundation but the most repulsive materialism. That's proved even in the concrete representation they have of the Beyond-— which for them is identified with Abraham's bosom

Circumscribing the Jewishness of ישוע‎ and attempting to Aryanize the origins of Christianity is only part of it. At a later meeting, Hitler focuses his tirade on the Bible, and the Old Testament:

>It is a great pity that this tendency towards religious thought can find no better outlet than the Jewish [pettifoggery](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pettifoggery) of the Old Testament. For religious people who, in the solitude of winter, continually seek ultimate light on their religious problems with the assistance of the Bible, must eventually become spiritually deformed. The wretched people strive to extract truths from these Jewish chicaneries, where in fact no truths exist. As a result they become embedded in some rut of thought or other and, unless they possess an exceptionally commonsense mind, degenerate into religious maniacs.

I think that it is laid out pretty clear here as to his views of the Old Testament - although his view of the Paul-corrupted , namely that they were slightly negative! Late in this particular discourse, he also calls it ""Jewish filth and priestly twaddle"" and "" Jewish mumbo jumbo"", and also laments that the Bible was ever translated into German, noting:

>So long as the wisdom, particularly of the Old Testament, remained exclusively in the Latin of the Church, there was little danger that sensible people would become the victims of illusions as the result of studying the Bible.

Now of course, Hitler, while his opinion is perhaps more powerful a voice that any other, is not the only one to look at, and you find this anti-Old Testament sentiment expressed elsewhere. Rheinhold Krause, a German Christian movement leader and Nazi, for instance, was unabashed in his views that Martin Luther's work remained 'unfinished' and that there remained work to be done, namely the completion of the Germanization of the Church, which included elimination of any remaining Jewish influence, and that explicitly included the Old Testament, as well as, previously noted, the influence of Paul. Perhaps one of the few *values* that the German Christians found in the Jewish tomes was that, for a commited anti-Semite, it stood as illustration of ""the inability of the Jews to live up to God’s expectations."" During his 1933 speech at the Berlin Sportpalast, it was under the demand:

>Away with the Old Testament! A Christianity which still clings to the Old Testament is a Jewish Religion, irreconcilable with the spirit of the German people.

He was hardly alone in his voice. In 1933, Reich‘s Bishop Ludwig Müller proclaimed similarly that ""We must emphasize with all decisiveness that Christianity did not grow out of Judaism but developed in opposition to Judaism"", and in the 1939 Godesberg Declaration of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, it was stated:

>Did Christianity arise out of Judaism being thus its continuation and completion, or does it stand in opposition to Judaism? To this question we respond: Christian faith is the unbridgeable religious contradiction to Judaism.

Now, to be sure, the German Christian movement, which was intimately tied into the racist voelkish movement, didn't speak for all Christians who were German. The Confessing Church, German Protestants who were opposed to growing Nazi influence within the Church in Germany, rejected such a platform and would continue to use the Christian scripture as before, although they couldn't avoid being caught up in the debate, and having to defend their choice. For those Germans who did ascribe to the effort to 'de-Judaize' Christianity, they would publicly smear the Confessing Church as ""nothing but diluted Judaism”. This in turn lead to attempts to defend the ""Germanness"" of the Old Testament, which came in various forms. One popular vein was to focus on Luther's anti-Semitism, and thus argue that if the Old Testament was *truely* Jewish, Luther would have rejected it. Volkmar Hentrich further argued in his 1935 defense that:

>when one considers the zeal with which the ancient Germanics embraced the Old Testament with its stories of war, heroes and an all-powerful God who easily defeats his enemies in battle (1935, p 396). And given the Germanic nature of the Old Testament, a German can read it without fear of being “Judaized.”

And of course, some people out and out rejected either the rejection or the ""Germanization"", but anyone who did so publicly, of course, was standing in stark opposition to the regime. Writing in 1934, Wilhelm Vischer's ""The Old Testament Witness to Christ"" was perhaps the most public example of this, where he wrote a stirring defense that “the Christian Church stands or falls with the recognition of the unity of both Testaments” and used the Old Testament stories to make a statement directly in opposition to the Nazis. It perhaps goes without saying that Vischer eventually fled Germany, settling in Switzerland where he worked as an anti-Nazi activist and headed the ""Club of Friends of Israel”.

So hopefully that lays things out for you. The Old Testament absolutely presented a conundrum for the Nazis, and to solve it, basically, you see several strains in varying degrees of extremity, from those who adamantly rejected *all* Jewish influence of Christianity and attempted to give it German/Aryan origins, through those attempting to manage a synthesis, to the other end where people like Vischer or Karl Barth were not afraid to call out such actions.

919,AskHistorians,"I'm a 'hillbilly' living a secluded life in Appalachia in the American south during the American Civil War. Do I know there is a war going on, and I am technically living in a different country?","Awesome question! I've personally never read any cases of individuals being so totally isolated from the society that they were unaware of the Civil War in its entirety. That said, the South was an extremely diverse place during the war and was far from being a monolithic region all falling into line to support the Confederate government. This was even more so true in rural areas of the Appalachian mountains.  This question also, interestingly, brings up the importance of the home front during the Civil War and the guerrilla warfare that often impacted these more isolated families. 

While your question is broad, I would like to focus on the Shelton Laurel Massacre as a story of isolation and violence in the Appalachian mountains. In the Western North Carolina mountains (WNC), pockets of families that may traditionally fall underneath the definition of 'hill billy' lived and were aware of the conflict. While they certainly would not refer to themselves as such, they lived a lifestyle that would be commonly associated with the modern definition of hillbilly. Author Philip Paludan wrote ""*Victims: A True Story of the Civil War""* that covers a rural mountain family that was massacred by Confederates in an infamous war crime.

Roughly two-thirds of people in 1860 were defined as rural families. The Shelton family of Madison County, North Carolina had lived in their respective part of the mountain for three generations before the Civil War started. They were able to provide enough through subsistence farming to provide for their families and sometimes made it to the market to make a few dollars. Visitors to this area of WNC wrote ""Every phase of the mountaineer's life connects in some way with tradition currently received...Castaways...on some unknown island...untroubled by the growth of civilization, customs and ideas unaltered from the time of their fathers"" (Paludan, 11).  Paludan writes that ""It \[the Civil War\] had come ripping into the fabric of a life whose rhythms were seldom interrupted"" (5). 

As the war progressed and became less popular, desertion rates increased. These deserters often fled home to help their struggling families. These individuals often became targets of Confederate war policies like forced conscription and Tax in Kind (a 10% tax on farmed goods that civilians would give CSA authorities). These deserters and policies often put more isolated families into contact with outside forces. Additionally, the guerrilla warfare that occurred brought fighting as well. Some families, like the Sheltons, became targets because of Union support in the guerrilla fighting. The closest hub for the family was in Marshall, North Carolina where salt rations were being withheld from them.  


 This was essentially a death sentence, as salt was used for meat preservation in the winter. This culminated in a raid in which members of the Shelton family overwhelmed guards in Marshall and stole salt and clothing. Confederate forces, while not on official orders to do such, responded by attacking and torturing civilians for information. These CSA soldiers eventually executed 13 civilians, the youngest being 13. News of this spread far relatively quickly and became an infamous part of the Appalachian Civil War history.   


Some historians, like Daniel Sutherland, would argue that the homefront and guerrilla warfare that isolated communities experienced were actually turning points in the Confederate war effort similar to how Gettysburg and Vicksburg were. This guerrilla warfare spilled over and affected isolated families in different ways. So, these individuals would have been aware of the conflict, but participation or loyalty would vary from area to area. I can expand on this or answer follow up questions around lunch!

920,AskHistorians,Why did “Jesus” become a popular given name in the Spanish-speaking world while remaining almost unheard-of in other historically Christian societies?,"From an earlier follow-up answer:

Among sixteenth-century holy women and men (saints, wannabe saints, nuns, monks, unaffiliated mystics), there is a particularly Spanish tradition of shedding one's family name to indicate belonging to God instead of an earthly family. So, for example, the Dutch Jesuit-saint Peter Canisius (Latinized *Kanis*) kept his father's name when he joined the Society of Jesus, and Italian Dominican Alessandra de Ricci changed her *first* name in honor of Catherine of Siena but kept the de Ricci family name. But Juan de Yepes y Álvarez changed his name to Juan de San Mateo upon joining the Carmelite order, and went a step further when founding his own stricter monastery, taking on the appellation Juan de la Cruz--John of the Cross. And Teresa Sánchez de Cepeda y Ahumada might be better known today as Teresa of Avila thanks to the location of her convent, but her autobiography is the life of St. Teresa of Jesús.

It's not a rule, of course. Francis Xavier is known by his family's *castle*. But a look at the inquisition records of visionaries and prophets from ~1600 Seville indicates the popularity in Spain of taking on a second name to show possession by God: Ana de los Santos, Antonia de San Francisco (a member of the Franciscan order), Barbara de Jesús, Juan de Jesús ,  Caterina de Jesús, Maria de la Concepcion, Mariana de Jesús.

Much of the religious care in the New World was carried out by members of religious orders like the Dominicans and Franciscans, who, in line with that tradition, were big fans of taking on the names of preferred saints or other religioius things. This religious care included baptism, which brought with it the bestowal of Christian names on Mexican native populations.

In Rebecca Horn's studies of naming patterns among the Nahua as recorded in 16th-17th century census and other records, she traces the gradual triumph of Christian names of Nahuatl ones. Through the mid 16th century, Christian records show a common pattern of a Christian first name and Nahuatl second name for both women and men. In the second half of the century, the pattern starts to slip among women. Nahuatl names fall away, being replaced by Spanish first and second names; men mostly retain the Spanish first, Nahuatl second. Horn insinuates that the growing gender differentiation may reflect a shift from the *use* of Nahuatl names to Spanish ones, but I probably digress.

More relevant here is that in the 17th century, Spanish first and second baptismal names have become the rule for both women and men. Frequently, although not exclusively, the baptizing friar would bestow their own ""de [santx]"" name. Sometimes, especially later in the century, they would follow the pattern of choosing a Christocentric Christian devotion (de la Cruz, de Jesus) instead of their patron saint.

One of Horn's really interesting observations is the growth of a class divide among the Nahua population in the 17th century. Upper-class Mexicans continued to keep the ""de/de la"" form of the name. Its use faded among the lower classes in favor of the simplified name.

So gradually, religious women and men shunning their earthly family names for a divine family became the baptismal names bestowed by a missionary friar. It's clearer to me why upper-class Mexicans would have preferred to preserve the ""de"", but less so why it faded otherwise. Nevertheless, that's the basic progression of the name Jesus from the talisman-like ""IHS"" with quasi-magical powers of the 15th century, to the popular first name Jesús by 1700.

921,AskHistorians,Switzerland granted women the right to vote in 1971. Why did it take so long for them to do so? Did it cause any controversy in other Western countries?,"So, Switzerland was one of the last countries where women gained the right to vote, though it was not the last one. Excluding those that – you know – do not vote or don't have hardly any women as citizens and do not vote like the Vatican, Liechtenstein was actually the last country in Europe to do so in 1984.

But while in the case of Liechtenstein, this relates to the fact that their structures are not as democratic elsewhere and their ruler has way too much power, in Switzerland the reason it took so long is due to their direct democratically political structure and due to the fact that Switzerland as the every neutral country they are has not undergone and experienced the major political shift or revolution other countries have undergone at the beginning of the 20th century. Take it's neighbors: Austria, Germany, and Italy all underwent what can only be classified as a political revolution at the end of WWI and it was very much within that context, and political movements like the Social Democrats which had been previously fighting the old order gaining power that women received the right to vote. France took considerably longer but them introducing women's suffrage in 1945 was also preceded by what arguably can be seen as civil war and a sort of political revolution.

Switzerland had had a suffrage movement dating back to the 19th century. While its 1848 constitution did introduce a federal structure that was decidedly very, very federalist as opposed to centrist and provided the groundwork for the political system of Switzerland, it was interpreted in a way that suffrage only extended to males (the constitution says ""All Swiss are equal before the law"" but the reason why they didn't extend this to women was because, well, they interpreted it that way and also because several Kantons did connect the right to vote with previously having served in the Swiss armed forces – something women were not allowed to do).

Anyways, in 1866 a first petition was filed to extend the right to vote to women and many organizations and women campaigned in the following years for the right to suffrage. And they did make progress. In 1874 a first revision with regards to women was accepted that lead to civil right equality (meaning they were able to legally own property and so forth) but not the right to vote.

The first major chance for change came in 1922 when several Kantons held referenda about women's suffrage and these were rejected and here is also where we come to the specifics of the Swiss political system. While Switzerland has a parliament, a lot of their political decisions are made either on the level of federal states, the Kantons, or through public referenda, where the voters are presented with options to vote over.

For a change of the constitution, such as women's suffrage, it requires both: A majority of the popular vote in a referendum as well as a majority of the votes of the Kantons. How the Kantons figure out how they vote in such matters was for the majority of the 20th century, up to them. They could hold referenda, they could let their representatives decided or just draw straws for all that matters (they did not draw straws though).

So, in essence, while there probably would have been a majority for women's suffrage at least at some points in time or at least in some Kantons, overall, the introduction of women's suffrage in Swizerland required the male population to vote for it in a referendum. And like the general dynamic of asking people to share power, there was for a long time a very decided anti-women's suffrage standpoint among the male voters.

The Swiss League against women's suffrage, a 1920s organization, said as much when they argued that equal voting rights for women and women's equality in general are ideas ""imported from foreign countries"" and that ""Swiss women are not interested in such frivolities"".

Anyways, after the Second World War the Swiss political landscape and culture did change a bit. What first pushed the idea forward was a referendum over the possibility for women to take part in a civil protection corps (like doing stuff for the military in case of an invasion) and the inclusion of the Social Democrats in the Swiss federal government, which pushed women's rights forward.

So, in 1959 a referendum on women's suffrage was held and 67% of the popular vote and almost all of the Kantons save 3 voted no. This reinvigorated the women's suffrage movement that during WWII had somewhat lost its steam. This team, also catholic women's organizations took part and while further inroads were made, what really lead to the final push necessary for women's suffrage is the 1968 students movement and radical feminist politics.

In the wale of 1968 protests erupted all over the country instigated by radical feminist organizations who had split from previous women's suffrage organizations and in 1969 staged a demonstration of 5000 people in the Swiss capital, Bern. Now, 5000 doesn't sound like much but for Swiss conditions this was huge. And the government became shaken by this. When more conservative organization also started supporting some of the house-occupying, public protesting radical feminists, the government saw itself backed into a corner while under the impression of the massive cultural changes of the late 60s and early 70s, which all over Europe made young and younger people more receptive to social and political change after the stuffy atmosphere of post-WWII Europe the population in Switzerland was much more receptive to the idea of women's suffrage.

After some to and fro between the Bundesrat, the Nationrat and the Ständerat (the various parliaments and representative chambers in Switzerland) a new referendum was held in 1971 65% of the popular vote voted for women's suffrage while 15 ½ Cantons (there are Cantons that only count for half a vote) voted yes against 6 ½ Cantons that voted no. And thus, women's suffrage was introduced in Switzerland.

In all of Switzerland? No, one bastion of the detractors of women's suffrage still held out in form of the Kanton Appenzell Innerrhoden (also Appenzell Außerrhoden but they weren't the last ones). Appenzell Innerrhoden, a very rural and conservative Kanton, refused to adopt the law and waged a legal and political battle against women's suffrage until they finally relented in 1990 when they were sued in front of the Federal Court of Switzerland.

As for causing controversy, this for the most part exceeds my expertise but one thing where this caused problems is when Switzerland tried to become part of the European Human Rights Declaration in the late 1960s, since that Declaration includes explicit reference to universal suffrage. So, this took until 1974 because essentially, Switzerland violated the European Human Rights Convention.

But in terms of why it took so long: The main reason is a political system that enables a group in power to directly vote on sharing these votes with others and as such things are often wont to turn out, this majorly frustrated the extension of basic democratic human rights to over half of the population of Switzerland until a major culture change came along and was promoted in radical ways by feminists.

922,AskHistorians,I found a Koryo (Korea) era book dating around 990 CE that my great grandfather had. It's still readable but not in the best condition. What should I do with it?,"**Holy cats. I agree with /u/PangeranDipanagara -- if these books are legitimately that old, you're probably better off not trying to preserve them on your own.** Libraries and museums with the means to house ancient book collections control temperature and humidity to slow the rate of deterioration, and the scholars who study them take special precautions. 

I would try to contact an institution about this fairly soon. If your great-grandfather dug them up during the Japanese imperial era, then he must have been professionally active at some point between 1910 and 1945, and the books themselves may have been out of the ground for more than a hundred years at this point. If they've made it this long, that's all to the good, but every day you delay is another one in which they can be lost to fire, theft, or somebody knocking a Red Bull onto them. I've never been in a position to sell or donate an ancient book and can't advise you on what to do, but [this information page by the Smithsonian](http://library.si.edu/departments/special-collections/information-old-books) might help a bit.

**My first suggestions would be the National Library of Korea or National Museum of Korea, or secondarily Seoul National University.** The Koreans have long had problems trying to retrieve books and artifacts that were taken out of the country during the late Joseon dynasty and colonial era, and just from an ethical perspective, I think you would be right to offer the books to Korean institutions first. If you're elsewhere, there are also Korea/East Asia collections in a number of Western facilities (Yale, Harvard, Cornell, the British Library, Cambridge, National Library of Australia, etc.). Most of them are heavily weighted toward post-1800 content, but I think all have collections of ancient Korean texts and the means to house them.

>Also during the Japanese imperial times, I'm not expert on this, but handing a Korean historical artifact to Japanese authorities probably wouldn't have survived.

Possibly, but I think their more likely fate would have been to end up vanishing into a private collection in Japan and no one would ever have found out about them. This is a depressingly common practice in colonized or otherwise subjugated states. Although, to their credit, [the Japanese have made an effort](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2011/10/18/23/0301000000AEN20111018007100315F.HTML) to find and return some artifacts and texts to the Koreans."
923,AskHistorians,"In the United States, when and for what reason did homes begin to have carpet installed throughout whole rooms (as opposed to large area rugs over wooden floors)?","The American consumer is a curious, contrary, and above all cheap creature, and the success of wall-to-wall carpeting in the second half of the twentieth century is one of the greatest testimonies to that.

The story must begin in the late 19th century, with the *decline* of full-floor covering. That's right--from the later 18th century, tacked-down carpet had grown more and more popular for warmth and aesthetics. Mind you, we're not talking about actual ""Oriental carpet"", but rather the cheap substitutes that had originally covered up expensive carpet in high-foot-traffic areas. This would be tacked to a wooden floor in strips across the room sewn together; or, with the advent of the broad-loom at the end of the century, maybe tacked to a wooden band around the edges of even a stone floor.

Charles Locke Eastlake was having none of this.

Eastlake was an architect and furniture visionary from England whose book/essay collection *Hints on Household Taste* spearheaded a new wave of interior decoration described as ""simple, real, strong, and honest""--more austere, angled, and much less ornamented than what he considered overwrought Victorian styles. Mary Jean Smith Madigan points out that American acolytes of Eastlake tried mightily to dissociate themselves from his name even as they basically copied his aesthetic (probably because he was so well known that there was already a backlash against him!--just, not his ideas). This was particularly true of his most influential American ~~plagiarist~~ heir, *New York Times* and book author Clarence Chatham Cook. 

One of Cook's most important propagated principles, which he drew wholeheartedly from Eastlake, was that carpeting should absolutely not be wall-to-wall. The straight lines and square shapes created by area rugs and the visual effect of the ""clean"" space fit perfectly into the Eastlake aesthetic. Furthermore, with the ideal of hygiene and cleanliness that became so central to good solid middle class identity in the Progressive era, Eastlake, Cook, and his other disciples heavily sold the advantage of throw rugs to be taken outside and beaten clean.

We have taken this apparent tangent mostly because I like words, but also because it is crucial to understand that while Eastlake style, ""Homestyle Design,"" Aestheticism, whatever you want to call it, drastically reduced the consumer premium on wall-to-wall soft floor covering, preference was ultimately preference rather than totality. Carpet retained an air of luxury, class, and abundance. Right after the deprivation years of World War I and World War II, the carpet industry in America reached its pre-1950s highs of almost 90 million square yards sold (1923 and 1948)--before falling significantly in subsequent years. In 1951, 73 million square yards of carpet were sold--in 1955, only two percent of American master bedrooms were carpeted--the carpet industry left the 1940s seriously worried for its fate.

One place that was *not* worried about its economic fate at that time, on the other hand, was Dalton, Georgia. Although ""factories and manufacturing"" and ""U.S. South"" are not typically joint phrases, Dalton had made itself the exception with the cultivated evolution of its cotton mills into the tufted textile manufacturing industry. The in-home workshops of Catherine Evans Whitener and her friends, producing ""chenille"" bedspreads with some carpets on the side, caught the attention of northern investor-industrialists. They came south, where labor costs were lower, and basically turned Dalton into *the* tufted textile town. Earlier efforts at making machines to produced tufted textiles rather than hand-sewing were perfected. The northerners also brought the use of synthetic fibers as well, newly available after the war, to replace the traditional cotton and wool of the bedspreads and carpets as a cost-saving feature. (""Every woman wants a wool carpet, but Acrilan ihas the same qualities and is cheaper,"" ran the Monsanto ads).

In 1951, the tufted textile industry's presence in the carpet industry was tiny--""carpet industry"" was synonymous with ""woven carpets."" But the price differential was significant enough that by 1954, the American carpet industry's leaders were worried in a big way about the new competition, especially with the still-small consumer demand for carpet.

So they decided to embark on a full-court press campaign to make Americans *demand* carpet:

> As the largest company in the industry, we feel it is our duty to sell the concept of carpet--the generic of carpet

asserted Mohasco's Herbert Jay, vowing to ""[sell] consumers on the concept of carpet per se."" And so the American Carpet Institute and its member companies waged a war in advertising and in government. By 1958, carpet was the #1 most-advertised household item, ahead even of television sets. 

""Home Means More With Carpet On the Floor"" ran the ads' tagline. And it was not just empty words. The carpet industry lobbied the U.S. government hard to have the price of carpet included in the overall cost of the house when calculating mortgage values and rates. This made a carpeted house a more attractive financial investment. 

Other lines of advertisement promoted the benefits of carpet for the postwar family: ""quiet, beauty, and warmth."" They stressed the freedom of choice--color! pattern!--even amidst the general trend in *homogenization* of household options. Carpet became a place to pretend to express individuality, argues Philip Scranton. (I am putting it less charitably than Scranton, but you get the idea).

But here's the thing: American consumers are contrary, cheap, and have the attention span of a peanut.

The woven carpet industry's massive ad campaign succeeded all right--by 1963, nearly 300 million square yards of carpet were sold in the US (recall: 73mil in 1951). But American consumers gave not a single care whether it was woven or tufted, wool or synthetic. They wanted what looked good, what was popular, and what was cost-effective. That meant tufted textile, which accounted for 250 million of those yards.

There are certainly other factors that enabled wall-to-wall carpeting to become popular: a rise in per capita income directly correlated to an increase in carpet purchases; the wider availability and marketing as desirable of vacuum cleaners supplied the means for servant-less women to keep them clean. 

But we must not confuse enabling factors with causation. In the late 1950s, a massive advertising campaign for an upscale product with lingering associations of luxury attempted to save its industry from being replaced by a new, cheaper, technology-driven variant--only to sell the American public on the upstart instead, and on an utterly unprecedented scale.

924,AskHistorians,What are the roots of anti-intellectualism in the United States? What is its history?,"Awesome question. The classic answer can be found in Richard Hofstadter's 1963 book, *Anti-Intellectualism in American Life*. Hofstadter, who went on to win the 1964 Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction for the book, wrote:

>""Anti-intellectualism . . . is founded in the democratic institutions and the egalitarian sentiments of this country.""

For Hofstadter, who traces anti-intellectualism to broadsheets levied against some of the first American presidential candidates, the roots go to the classic American debate between who governs best. Is it the mob, the vast majority of Americans who have little interest or knowledge in a topic, or is it a smaller and traditionally less representative group of people who have more experience and education on a topic?

As Woodrow Wilson said in 1912: ""What I fear is a government of experts. God forbid that in a democratic country we should resign the task and give the government over to experts. What are we for if we are to be scientifically taken care of by a small number of gentlemen who are the only men who understand the job?""

Hofstadter is still quoted frequently on this topic, but there are a lot of things he missed discussing, as Nicholas Lemann points out [in a wonderful 50th anniversary retrospective review](http://www.cjr.org/second_read/richard_hofstadter_tea_party.php).

Hofstadter (and plenty of people today) think of anti-intellectualism as solely the domain of the political right. But Hofstadter missed people like Donald Kagan, Robert Bork, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Allan Bloom, who wrote *The Closing of the American Mind.*

He also tended to describe business as anti-intellectual, when we know that today, business is one of the most intellectual-friendly branches of American society. America today hosts designers and inventors, innovators and trend-makers, rather than industrialists and manufacturers as it did in 1963, when Hofstadter was writing.

He also missed the rise of the Civil Rights movement for women and minorities in the United States.

That's getting a little off track, however. The bottom line is that there is (and has been) a constant push-pull between appeals to the ""mob"" and the ""elite"" in American society.

In *Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic,* Gordon Wood contends that the first 30 years of the United States resulted in a switch from the desires of the nation's founders ─ who were the elite of the nation ─ to the will of the middling people, those involved in commerce and enterprise.

The founders of the United States had envisioned a Congress and President who were already wealthy and thus immune from corruption. The thought went that they would be self-sacrificing and put aside their businesses to serve the national good for a period, then return to their own interests afterward. 

Joyce Appleby and Wood contend that the middle classes, who enriched themselves through industry and enterprise, developed a belief that the self-made man was the ideal politician, not someone who had been born wealthy, was educated, and thus theoretically could be trusted to make a decision without being swayed by public opinion.

And so we have a push and pull, dating back to the roots of the United States.

Hofstadter also makes the case that evangelical Protestantism in the United States, particularly in the South, strongly contributed to anti-intellectualism in the latter half of the 19th century and the 20th century. Mark Noll's *The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind* is a more in-depth analysis of this aspect.

Noll has done some excellent work on American religious history (I highly recommend his *The Civil War as a Theological Crisis*) and he explains that a lot of the American evangelical anti-intellectualism can be traced back to the development of a ""literalist"" interpretation of the Bible as a response to the anti-slavery movement of the 19th century. Before the 19th century, and particularly before the French Revolution, churches and religious organizations tended to be pro-science if they were anything. 

In the United States, this began to change as the arguments about slavery intensified. As Noll points out, the Civil War caused many churches to fission into southern and northern branches, based upon their beliefs in slavery. Northern churches tended to favor an interpretation-based view of the Bible, while Southern churches stuck with a much more literal interpretation of the Bible. Forex, since the Bible refers to slavery and the proper treatment of slaves, it must be appropriate to have slavery in the United States, they argued.

This literalist philosophy was later applied to things as varied as racial segregation, abortion, and global warming. Because of its reliance upon scripture as the absolute (literally Gospel) truth, anything that took a different viewpoint was seen in a dim light."
925,AskHistorians,"Why was God referred to as a ""King"" and Heaven as a ""Kingdom"" at the same time that temporal Christian rulers held titles of ""Emperor"" and ruled over ""Empires"", which were considered above Kingdoms?","The bog-standard title for God in the Latin Middle Ages isn’t *rex*, it’s *dominus.* That is, not what we would translate “king,” but “lord.” It’s an important enough title that even vernacular writers use “dominus” sometimes instead of their own word. Because to medieval people, addressing God as “Lord” was a deeply significant theological claim—especially in contrast to earthly authority. Borrowing from [an earlier answer:](
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/670hxl/what_are_the_origins_of_the_title_lord_in/dgn3wy6/)

There are some neat things to be found in individual European languages. Medieval German, for example, mixes the Latin *dominus* with the German *herr*--which is more like ""mister"" or “master” than *necessarily* a noble title. And as Benjamin Arnold showed, for a good chunk of the Middle Ages, Latin chronicles just call all German rulers *princeps* regardless.

But there’s a deeper theological issue in question, one that medieval people absolutely did address. Which is: can we use terms of earthly authority to refer to God, and can we use terms that are euphemisms for God to refer to people? And, critically, *what are the implications of doing so*?

When Jerome translates the Vulgate with ""dominus,"" the word is *well* in current vogue to talk about earthly dynastic power. At the time, dominus was often a particular reference to the head of a household as both head of family and *master of slaves*, with everyone placed inferior to him. Calling Jesus ""dominus"" is a very particular theological claim in this context.

And the reverse implications of it will come to bother 12th century theologian John of Salisbury, in fact. He's not so impressed by the 'willful tyranny' of contemporary earthly lordship. Thomas Bisson argues that John very deliberately skates away from using terms ""dominatio"" and ""dominus"" in his writing ""which have for him the resonance of willful power such as he can safely attribute only to God."" *Willful* is a key part of the theological claims implicit in dominus; it's the ability to make what you say into reality (through orders, through the laws of physics or in Bisson's argument about how much the 12th century actually sucked, through violence). So in John's case, the resistance isn't to calling God ""Lord."" God *is* Lord--the *only* Lord, the *only* one who ought to have that kind of effecting, willful power and might. An earthly ruler can be imperatrix (yes, empress) or princeps or dux or rex (two of which are also appellations for Christ, of course), but not dominus.

And then there are the direct ties between the lordship of Christ and the lordship of men. In the Rule of Benedict of all places, which helps govern monastic life throughout the Middle Ages, chapter 63 explains the position of the abbot within the community through the metaphor of Christ's lordship:

> But the Abbot, since he is believed to represent Christ, shall be called Lord and Abbot, not for any pretensions of his own but out of honor and love for Christ. 

This is coming out of the pastoral side of Christianity epitomized by the semi-contemporary Gregory the Great's description of the pope as the ""servant of servants""--the idea of humble, giving, *leading* lordship.  The ROB shows the importance of association and allegory/metaphor in shaping the medieval worldview. They were not sharply literalist in the sense that using the same title meant ascribing the same characteristics. But they did understand that the connotations of the title in one circumstance would be connotations of the title in other circumstances, just applied to the different context at hand.

Although, as we saw, the word ""dominus"" itself could mean rather different things depending on one's perspective."
926,AskHistorians,What was the reaction around the world to the Israeli Mossad assassinating and kidnapping former Nazis in other countries? Was this not in breach of international law?,"So, officially, there was only one of these operations that are known to have succeeded (there might have been more and there were a couple of operations that didn't work out) and that therefore required an international reaction and consideration of legality. While Israel did indeed try a couple of other Nazi criminals, those cases were managed in cooperation with the country where they hid, like the US or Canada, and where because of false statements these criminals made at the time of their migration they could be deported to Israel. This famous case was the capture of Adolf Eichmann.

Adolf Eichmann, head of the Reich Security Main Office's Referat IV B 4, responsible for the organization of deportations of Jews to Auschwitz and elsewhere, had managed to flee to Argentina in 1950 after he had received false identity papers in the name of ""Ricardo Klement"" with the help of Bishop Alois Hudal and his Nazi-sympathizing collaborators in the Vatican. In subsequent years, he worked for Mercedes in Argentinia and send for his German family to join him in Buenos Aires.

During his time in hiding, he was still in contact with some of his former Nazi friends and from 1956 forward was interviewed by former SS-member Wilhelm Sassen, who wanted to write Eichmann's biography. In the tapes of these interviews Eichmann reveals that unlike his later self-presentation in front of the court in Jerusalem, he indeed was an ardent Nazi and anti-Semite and was of the opinion that the movement would rise again in Germany, giving him a chance to finish what he started.

In the meantime, Eichmann was recognized by several survivors in Argentinian, most importantly, German-Jewish emigrant Lothar Hermann who passed on the information that Eichmann was living there to German District Attorney Fritz Bauer. Bauer tried to instigate a German investigation and eventual capture of Eichmann but was met with strong institutional resistance by a German justice system unwilling to confront the possibility of a German Eichmann trial. Eventually Bauer was forced to at least do something and passed on the pertinent information to Mossad director Isser Harel, who had previously received similar information about Eichmann's whereabouts from Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal.

Harel dispatched Shin Bet chief interrogator Zvi Aharoni to Buenos Aires on 1 March 1960, who was able to confirm the suspects's identity as Adolf Eichmann. In light of Argentina's policy of providing refuge for Nazi war criminals, the Israeli government decided that Eichmann should rather be captured instead of asking the Argentinian government for extradition. A team under the leadership of Mossad operative Rafi Eitan was dispatched to capture Eichmann and bring him to Israel.

They captured Eichmann, held him in a safe house for nine days then spirited him on board of an El Al airplane and flew him to Israel where he arrived two days later, on May 22, 1960.

After it was announced to the world that Eichmann had been captured in Argentina and brought to Israel, the Argentinian government reacted not very positively. While there initial diplomatic approaches to Israel remained unsuccessful, the Argentinian government lodged an official protest with the UN in June 1960 for violation of their sovereignty. The Israeli representative at the UN at that point claimed that the capture of Eichmann had only been the act of a group of individuals acting on private initiative and therefore – while representing a violation of Argentinian law – the act did not constitute a violation of sovereignty.

The UN Security Council disagreed and on June 22, 1960 it adopted [Resolution 138](/https://undocs.org/S/RES/138\(1960\)) in which it stated that Argentina's sovereignty had been violated and that Israel should pay reparations to Argentina. This was adopted with all votes and only Poland (then member of the Council) and the USSR abstaining from voting. Argentina and Israel eventually reached a mutual agreement to end the dispute on August 3, 1960.

So, while the UN security council had at the time the opinion that Israel had indeed breached international law, a variety of legal scholars have interpreted the situation differently: Nicholas N. Kittrie e.g. writing for the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology under the title *A Post-Mortem of the Eichmann Case* in 1964 interpreted the situation differently.

Writing that it was indeed the case that Israel despite the lack of an extradition treaty could have negotiated Eichmann's extradition with Argentina – he was living there as an illegal alien under a false name after all –, this was highly unlikely given the internal political situation there. Emphasizing that Argentina and Israel issued a joint statement ending the dispute he writes:

> However, after Israel made its apology the matter was declared closed in a joint communique issued by the two nations on August3, 1960. The failure of the United Nations and Argentina to insist upon Eichmann's return thus seemed technically to cure the illegality of the capture. As an individual Eichmann had no standing in international law, and whatever rights he possessed had to be enforced on his behalf by an aggrieved nation. The desire to avoid the embarrassing situation which the possession of Eichmann's person would have posed and the reluctance to awaken past memories kept the governments of Argentina (within whose boundaries he was found), Austria (of which he was a naturalized citizen), and Germany (whose Third Reich he served) from making a claim for or on behalf of Eichmann. Since all concerned nations waived their right to Eichmann, Israel appeared free, within the framework of its own law, to pursue with regard to him a conduct of its own choice.

What Kittrie is basically saying that without a government disputing these actions, the act itself becomes retroactively legal because in international law, the maxim of ""when there's no plaintiff, there's no judge"" is applied. He further argues that there is precedence found for similar cases all over English and US case law, especially pertaining to the seizure of ship's in international or another state's territorial waters and that the legality of the trial itself as well as the court's jurisdiction were not affected by this.

He concludes that most legal commentators agree on Israel's right to try the kidnapped Adolf Eichmann, if not by adherence to the standards of international law but by the general permissiveness of it, in that every state has the jurisdiction to to punish war criminals in its custody regardless of the nationality of the victim, the time it entered the war, or the place where the offense was committed, according the legal statutes created by the Nuremberg Trials.

In the end, the question of violation of international law became moot since Israel and Argentina settled the dispute surrounding Eichmann's capture thus retroactively giving the act if not legality then at least legitimacy.

Edited to add:

As reported by the [JTA](https://www.jta.org/1960/06/24/archive/security-council-rejects-demand-for-return-of-eichmann-to-argentina):

> Armand Bernard of France told the Council he considered that the apologies for violation of sovereignty already given by “the highest authorities of Israel” provided Argentina with the “expression of satisfaction” she had sought.

A position later adopted by the Argentinian government in August 1960.

--------------------------------------------

A claim has been also made that the Mossad was responsible for the assassination of Herberts Cukurs, also known as the ""Butcher of Riga"" in 1965. This claim originated from Gad Shimron's book *The Execution of the Hangman of Riga*, which was allegedly written together with the Mossad agent responsible for the assassination. In this case, however, the Mossad's involvement remains unclear and the archives have not been opened yet. Cukurs body was indeed found in the trunk of a car in 1965 together with several documents pertaining to his crimes committed in Riga after newspapers had received a note that it was there. Just what role the Mossad played in this is however still not entirely clear.

This lack of clarity pretty much suiting almost everybody involved, the assassination never drew much attention from governments or was tested for its legality under international law.

927,AskHistorians,"Were Pacific Islander cultures ever sufficiently remote/detached to consider the entire world as simply an ocean dotted by chains of islands? If so, did they have a name or ideological/religious concept for this theoretically ""endless ocean""?","There is archaeological evidence that the Polynesian peoples who settled the various Pacific islands did remain in contact with each other, despite some divergence in languages and culture over the centuries of individual settlements. The first thing it's important to remember is that these people were seriously skilled navigators, who knew how to use the stars, currents, winds, the flight patterns of birds, etc. to get from place to place. They weren't just randomly sending out canoes scatter-fashioned in the hope of hitting something. Settlement expeditions were planned after initial discoveries were made by people sent out to explore along known routes. We know this because necessary supplies were taken along from the home site~ seeds, breeding pairs of domesticated animals, etc.

We have evidence that places ""kept in touch"" from several sources. Oral tradition, indicating that contact was maintained, at least to some degree, between Tahiti and the Hawaiian Islands. There is evidence in the oral traditions of Hawaii that family visits took place, remains were returned to the home islands for burial, sacred soil and stones were moved between the two places, etc. Archaeological evidence~ stone tools have been found in French Polynesia that originated in Hawaii and on distant Pitcairn Island, evidenced by the fact that the type of stone used is only found in those places. Petroglyph art that has historical origins in the Hawaiian Islands has been identified in Tonga and Tahiti. Evidence of varying quality (linguistic, archaeological, genetic) has even been introduced that there was at least one-time contact between the people living on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and the western coast of South America. This last point should be taken with caution as of now, as the evidence remains circumstantial, and no definitive genetic evidence has emerged. 

I don't mean to suggest here that there was a steady flow of vessels traveling constantly between these island chains, but contact was maintained to one degree or another for centuries after colonization. So to your original question~ I don't know that any of the places Polynesian peoples settled were isolated long enough for all memory of ""other places"" to fade, and the archaeological and historical record is indicative of sustained, though at times sporadic, contact.

928,AskHistorians,Did Americans Start Viewing Alcohol as a “Nighttime Drink” Because of Prohibition?,"The shift in American perceptions to day drinking can mostly be tied back to the domestic politics of the 1960's, 70's, and 80's. As early as 1961, President John F. Kennedy stated opposition to the extent of tax deductibility of business lunches as business expenses. However, in 1972 the issue came to a more prominent place in American politics thanks to George McGovern. During his presidential campaign, he told blue collar voters that ""you pay for half of every $20 martini lunch that a businessman deducts while you can't deduct the price of a bologna sandwich.""^(1) While McGovern was annihilated in the election of 1972, this message remained. Four years later, Jimmy Carter took up the torch of lunch deductions again, this time as a form of opposition to corruption in DC, thus also a strike against the incumbent, Gerald Ford.^(2)  His administration would push for changes to the tax code on this issue, but ultimately to no avail.^(3) In 1986 however, Ronald Reagan would sign a bill that reduced the deduction from 100 to 80 percent and Bill Clinton would sign a bill in 1993 that reduced it to 50 percent.^(4) 

While these bills were aimed more generally at business extravagance than alcohol in particular, I would argue that the evocative imagery of the ""three-martini lunch"" and its connection to corruption played a significant role in changing the wider public taste for day drinking with lunch. At the same time, American corporate culture began a major shift towards prioritization of productivity. Together, the combination of productivity prioritization, negative public perception, and decreased financial exemption pushed out the business lunch. As Paul Freedman observes in his discussion of the Four Seasons restaurant, ""more than two decades later, many publishing offices have moved downtown and expense accounts have been reduced.""^(5) Even now op-eds and other pieces come out occasionally which look back fondly at a time of multi-hour expensed lunches, even as they enabled alcoholism and provided dubious financial benefit.^(6)

929,AskHistorians,"In the infamous ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"", Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham calls to ""cancel Christmas."" What would Christmas have meant to the average person living in Plantagenet England?","You know, a medieval lord threatening to cancel Christmas around 1200 might be the one historically accurate moment in *Prince of Thieves.*

No, really.

Okay, technically the person who tries to cancel Christmas in 1198 is the pope, he's talking specifically about Paris, and it's more ""cancel your fun version of it and install mine."" But English theologian Robert Grosseteste has *much* more to say to the church in Lincoln some thirty-odd years later:

> It is detestable to violate the sanctity of the venerable solemnity of the Lord’s Circumcision [part of the Christmas season] with the sordidness of wanton pleasures.

> ...By no means permit the Feast of Fools – filled with vanity and foul with wanton pleasures, an event hateful to God and beloved of devils – to take place henceforth in the church of Lincoln.

Of course, Bobs is talking specifically about altar servers and lesser clerics working or studying at the Lincoln cathedral. When the lords of Damerham and Ditcheat cancelled Christmas for their peasants around the same time, it meant that no one was invited to the manor house for a night of drinking and then wheat bread as a party favor.

But there's a reason all of these things come crashing together in Robin Hood's England, right smack in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Christmas was suddenly a *much* more important holy day in Latin Christianity, and it was both magnifying and absorbing secular feasting traditions.

Two big relevant things happened over the 12th century. First, your everyday, average person got a lot more interested in Christianity as a religion. Second, the human side of Christ became a lot more important within that Christianity. I didn't copy this part of the quote, but: Grosseteste is actually upset about partying on one of the new feast days associated with Christmas, the Circumcision of Jesus. And he goes all the way with his allegory:

> Since the circumcision of our Lord Jesus Christ was his first suffering and of no little pain, and is also the sign of the spiritual circumcision whereby the foreskins of hearts are removed and all carnal pleasures and sensual lusts cut away

All the way down to the snipped-off foreskin, later medieval Europe was falling deeper and deeper into an obsession with the bloody, material, tangible, kissable human Christ. As one of the moments that most clearly expressed that humanity, Christmas rocketed up in popularity. Around 1220, Francis of Assisi staged the most famous ""living creche"" scene in history, playing the role of Mary as he laid a baby Jesus into a manger surrounded by animals.

So for peasants in Robin's England, there would be increasing spiritual significance to Christmas for at least some people. This is not the side of things that Pope Innocent and Grosseteste wanted to cancel, of course. And secular lords did not want to cancel the part of Christmas that usually involved nobles holding court for their vassals.

*That* part would be the revelry. The ""Feast of Fools"" mentioned above is one of the famous ""world upside down"" events. The appointment of a ""boy bishop"" for a day, who could make his (usual) superiors do foolish things and demand money from basically anyone he wanted, is the most famous example. But it isn't documented in every Christmas-linked Feast of Fools, and it is documented in connection with other celebrations in some places. 

You can probably guess some of the other pastimes that evoked Grosseteste's ire, like priests wearing women's clothing. You probably can't guess some of the other ones, like...burning shoes.

Peasants engaged in their own forms of misrule. Among other things: records of poaching in English lords' forests, especially of deer, shoot way up in the days before Christmastide. Actually, the Sheriff of Nottingham would have had *extra* reason to cancel this part of Christmas. (...Not that he would have had any say, to be fair). In the actual medieval ballads, Robin Hood is a famous and famously gleeful poacher.

Most of the really great alcohol-related stories that I know come from contemporary Norse regions or later centuries in England. But it doesn't seem like a stretch to put *all the ale* in early 13C English peasants' hands, too. In London, it seems people also enjoyed turning the first step of cooking into entertainment, setting up pigfights on the way to makin' bacon.

But the really interesting thing to me is that in all this ""verkehrtes Welt"" partying, a lot of Christmastide customs actually ended up reinforcing the world right side up. Max Harris argues persuasively that the church-based Feasts of Fools was a deliberate and successful attempt to appropriate and Christianize pagan traditions.

Additionally, I mentioned earlier the lords who chose Christmas as a good time to hold court, hearing petitions and passing judgments for their *vassals*. And yes, some lords did not ""cancel Christmas"" and did engage in a custom of distributing food and drink. But they nevertheless did so in a way that reinforced a hierarchy among their tenants.

The powerful Abbot of Glastonbury invited some of his tenants up for a feast. But first of all, he ordered his guests to invite guests of their own, from their own servants or field laborers. Second, among his first-round guests, he allotted different amounts of food and drink based on how wealthy they were. 

So in the Latin West, Christmas was more important than ever in the days of Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham. Its significance as a religious holiday, though not *absent* before, was on the sharp upswing. And connected with that, it seems, the midwinter feasting and fun was also evolving in some exciting ways--but always, ultimately, ways perfectly within bounds."
930,AskHistorians,I have heard Don Quixote is considered the first modern novel. Don Quixote itself is a parody of books I would consider novels. What differentiates these pre-modern novels from modern novels?,"So this is both a really good but also extremely complex question which I wish I could give a definitive answer to but know that I am both relatively understudied (I only have a Bachelor's in Comparative Literature, I studied Baroque Spanish Literature) and contextual (I am a student of literature, not a student of the history of literature).

Two things we must break down:

1. Modernism. Do we mean literary modernism? I think so given we're talking about *Don Quixote* but feel free to correct me here, I just wonder the context in which you hear people call it the ""first modern novel"" as that might help specify what we're talking about when we say ""modern novel.""
2. The novel. The first novel is a contested area of study (some say *The Golden Ass* others disagree). For now, I am going to assume that novel means a published work that could be widely *read*. I am choosing this definition only because of the context of *Don Quixote*'s publication after novels such as *Tirant lo Blanch* and alongside the massive amount of plays by writers like Lope de Vega.

While literary modernism is considered relatively new and delimited in time see Ezra Pound's often quoted line ""Make it New"" (which I am struggling to find a source for). Peter Childs's writes in his book *Modernism*:

> Modernist art is, in most critical usage, reckoned to be the art of what Harold Rosenburg calls ""the tradition of the new"". It is experimental, formally complex, elliptical, contains elements of decreation as well as creation and tends to associate notions of the artist's freedom from realism, materialism, traditional genre and form, with notions of cultural apocalypse and disaster.^[1](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Modernism/cJyEAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=modernism+peter+childs&printsec=frontcover)

In poetry the modernist turn associated with Pound is often focused on a heightened awareness of word choice, ""directly treating the thing,"" and musical composition.^[2](https://www.utoledo.edu/library/canaday/guidepages/Modernism2.html)

So both Ezra Pound's writings and the characteristics of modernism that Harold Rosenburg identifies place it sometime after the 1890s, the earliest, or after the 1930s. As Childs writes ""We can regard it as a timebound concept (say 1890 to 1930) or a timeless one (including Sterne, Donne, Villon, Ronsard). The best focus remains a body of major writers (James, Conrad, Proust, Mann, Gide, Kafka, Svevo, Joyce, Musil, Faulkner in fiction.""^[1](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Modernism/cJyEAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=modernism+peter+childs&printsec=frontcover) Childs also cites Pound's famous phrase to say that ""Modernist writers therefore struggled, in Ezra Pound's brief phrase, to 'make it new,' to modify if not overturn existing modes of representation"" in their attempts ""to render human subjectivity in ways more real than [literary] realism: to represent consciousness, perception, emotion, meaning and the individual's relation to society.""^[1](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Modernism/cJyEAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=modernism+peter+childs&printsec=frontcover)

But all of this is contextual information. None of which directly says ""why is Don Quixote considered the first modern novel""

To answer this question, I wish to turn towards Maurice Blanchot. In Blanchot's essay ""Literature and the Right to Death"" he writes what perhaps comes to define the field of literature, at least in my opinion, to this day:

> Let us suppose that literature begins at the moment when literature becomes a question. This question is not the same as a writer's doubts or scruples. If he happens to ask himself questions as he writes, that is his concern; if he is absorbed by what he is writing and indifferent to the possibility of writing it, if he is not even thinking about anything, that is his right and his good luck. But one thing is still true: as soon as the page has been written, the question which kept interrogating the writer while he was writing-though he may not have been aware of it-is now present on the page; and now the same question lies silent within the work, waiting for a  reader to approach-any kind of reader, shallow or profound; this question is addressed to language, behind the person who is writing and the person who is reading, by language which has become literature. (pp. 300-301)^[3](https://users.clas.ufl.edu/burt/deathsentences/blanchotliteraturerighttodeath.pdf)

Blanchot's focus here on a question, perhaps unconscious, to the writer and reader of a written work is what defines literature. Literature is an action of language interrogating itself through the history of reading and writing (since every writer is a reader and vice versa according to Borges's works [*Pierre Menard, Author of the* Quixote](http://www.jenliu.info/DIAP/Borges-Pierre-Menard_text.pdf) and [*Kafka and His Precursors*](https://www.gwern.net/docs/borges/1951-borges-kafkaandhisprecursors.pdf)).

As such the key aspects of *Don Quixote* as a work which are often pointed to as aspects of literary modernism are:

1. Harold Bloom's observation in the introduction to Edith Grossman's translation of *Don Quixote* that ""It is true that I cannot think of any other work in which the relations between words and deeds are as ambiguous as in *Don Quixote*, except (once again) for *Hamlet*"" (p. xxviii). This ambiguity comes to reflect both the focus on the qualities of words and subjectivity proposed by Pound and on the ""question"" of Blanchot.

2. Childs cites *Don Quixote*'s parody of ""the previously dominant mode of prose writing, the Romance""^[1](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Modernism/cJyEAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=modernism+peter+childs&printsec=frontcover)

3. Bloom also cites Kafka's reading of *Don Quixote* on p. xxxiv of his introduction to the book.

4. Childs identifies ""elements of religious skepticism, deep introspection, technical and formal experimentation, cerebral gameplaying, linguistic innovation, self-referentiality, misanthropic despair overlaid with humor, philosophical speculation, loss of faith and cultural exhaustion"" as all exemplifying ""the preoccupations of Modernist writing.""^[1](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Modernism/cJyEAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=modernism+peter+childs&printsec=frontcover)
 Many of which can be found in the pages of *Don Quixote*. Specifically I would highlight the poems at the beginning of the book which end with Babieca and Rocinante and the prologues to the first and second parts of *Don Quixote*---the first prologue acting as a way of distancing Cervantes from being the author of the book ""But though I seem to be the father, I am the stepfather of *Don Quixote*"" and the second prologue addressing the ""illustrious or perhaps plebeian reader"" (pp. 3 & 454).

The answer I would provide is that these pre-modern novels often lacked this sort of self-referentiality, formal experimentation, and linguistic innovation in addition to Don Quixote being read by and as contemporary with authors within literary modernism by the readers and writers answering the question behind Cervantes's pages.

I do hope someone more qualified and better read than I am in the topic can answer your question. I do not feel as if my answer does it justice completely since I have not read many novels released at the same time as *Don Quixote* but I have read many of the plays released at the same time.

**EDIT**: Foucault also writes about *Don Quixote* in his book *The Order of Things* (I hesitated to bring him up in my answer earlier because I couldn't remember it for sure although I knew Foucault referenced Borges because my undergrad thesis was on Borges). Anyways, [link is here if you're curious.](http://individual.utoronto.ca/bmclean/hermeneutics/foucault_suppl/OT_don_quixote.htm)"
931,AskHistorians,The Coca-Cola Company have created Fanta to circumvent embargo and IBM provided counting machines to concentration camps. How do American companies manage their German and occupied countries subsidiaries during the WW2?,"Expanded  from [an earlier answer of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4bmb7d/nazism_thugs_for_the_rich_how_accurate_is_this/)

The relationship of industrial capital and the Third Reich is one that is highly complex and the nature of international business adds a further layer of complexity. In 1920s, American companies saw Germany as a plum market by virtue of its large population and high degree of industrialization. This led to large-scale investment in German industries and subsidiaries opened up. Opel, for example, was established with the help of GM as a parent company in 1928. These international relationships continued after the advent of Hitler in 1933, but were often freighted with new political meaning. 

Hitler's drive for rearmament caused some alarm among German industrial circles. Although support for the Weimar Republic was very shallow among these types, they were seldom fans of the new order. Many German industrialists resented state interference in the running of the factory floor and while more than a few welcomed the Third Reich's anti-labor laws, they also became packaged together with NSDAP organs like the *Deutsche Arbeitsfront* which was a sinecure for NSDAP cronies. On the extreme end of opposition, Hugo Junkers, head of one of the most prominent aviation companies of the interwar period and a firm believer in the peaceful use of airpower, was put under house arrest and the state forced him to surrender his patents and shares in the Junkers firm. Most German industrial leaders sought a cooperative relationship with the Nazi state, but the example of Junkers was a chilling one for those that thought of resistance. It made a degree of business sense for managers to patronize the new order rather than resist it. Wilhelm von Opel, the chairman of Opel, spent lavish amounts on gifts to NSDAP elites and became the chief sponsor of the National Socialist Motor League. American-owned companies or their subsidiaries often had to deal with this new reality, but it was still an incredibly complex picture. The Third Reich encouraged the cartelization of the German economy, which already was one of the most centralized in Europe prior to 1933, and American multinationals had to operate in this environment. Opel, for example, had to comply with the 1936 Schell Program, which streamlined German automobile production making it more suitable for military use, but Ford's Cologne plant was exempt from these restrictions. Ford-Werke's managers managed to capitalize on their connections within the state to guarantee its position and provide soft commitments towards increasing production and standardization. There was considerable correspondence between Ford's leadership in the US and the Ford-Werke in Dearborn; the German managers of the subsidiary appraised their nominal US superiors of the desirability of securing state contracts and Dearborn eventually backed the sacking of Ford-Werke's general manager Erich Diestel because his Jewish background could threaten the Ford-Werke's claim to be an Aryanized German company. In contrast to Ford, IBM lost day-to-day control of its German Dehomag, but the New York company also  wanted to keep control of its near monopoly on tabulating machines, so it kept Dehomag  in operation to preserve the company's monopoly in Germany. 

IBM's case was paralleled in other major foreign-owned firms in Germany by the dawn of the war. While there were on paper owned by foreign concerns, they had been pretty much *de facto* German companies by 1939. The management had been Germanized and Jews thrown out of positions of authority. The laws of the Reich prevented profits from cycling out of the country, creating a headache for accountants. Reports on day to day operations grew more distant and only more so after the war broke out. But this did not mean that the German managers of these subsidiaries saw themselves as fully-independent from their parent companies. Many foreign firms were complicit in the larger process of Germanization, with more than a few gambling that playing with the state would lead to a more normalized business relationship when the political atmosphere was more relaxed. Other responses were predicated on the fear that if they resisted, then the Third Reich would engage in outright expropriation and control. This was what lay behind the convoluted case of tetraethyl lead gasoline. This was an old technology from the 1920s whose American-owned patents and manufacturing data were relatively open. Italy had already in 1935 overrode these patents on its own accord and allowed a state-owned company to produce it. There was alarm in American circles (the US patent was owned by the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation which in turn was under joint control of GM and Standard Oil) that Germany would follow the Italian precedent and seize control of the process and its production. Thus the Americans were more receptive to IG Farben's offer to form Ethyl GmbH with IG Farben, the German Standard Oil subsidiary, and Opel sharing ownership. The protection of a large German patron like IG Farben would allow the US firms to keep their trade secrets under some form of control, but the subsidiaries soon became passive partners as IG Farben assumed more control over Ethyl GmbH. Fears of losing control were also quite acute in the financial sector, both German and non-German owned, as they often operated under implicit threat that National Socialism saw such unproductive wealth as suspect and tainted by Judaism, which in turn made financial institutions more conducive towards freezing Jewish assets or other fiscal measures pushed by the state.  

There was very little in terms of principled or ethics-based opposition among large businesses within the Third Reich. The example of Hugo Junkers may have been a warning shot to other industrial chiefs, but it was also an outlier in terms of behavior by industrial chiefs. Frictions with the dictatorship often had more to do with allocations of raw materials and quotas rather than Aryanization or the later use of slave labor. Nor was the Nazi dictatorship simply a case of firms cowering for fear of their very existence. In the case of Opel, the German managers often parlayed the regime's rhetoric of autarky and confiscation of non-German property to GM in the hopes that the parent company would sanction its seeking funding for more raw materials. A number of companies bucked state directives ordering them to focus on armaments-related projects; IG Farben for example did not invest too heavily in synthetic fiber production because it felt it was not viable for the long-term health of the country even though synthetic fibers would be valuable for a war effort should Germany find itself blockaded. Other firms were able to hoard liquid assets for postwar expansion even though this was contrary to the needs of the war economy. The regime could of course use strong-arm tactics to get its way, but there always was room for maneuver within the Third Reich. The polycratic nature of the state meant that business leaders could find a powerful patron to block initiatives by other corners of the chaotically-organized state. Patronage sometimes failed, but it was one of the mechanisms companies used to survive and even profit from the Third Reich. 

The idea that the Nazis were ""thugs for the rich"" is a charge that actually dates back to the 1930s and was a staple of both socialist and communist propaganda of this time and in the later case remained an orthodoxy through the Cold War. It has also been taken as a given by various anti-capitalist movements seeking to tar existing multinational concerns like Ford with the taint of the Third Reich. Such contentions generate more heat than light. Hitler may have held Henry Ford and Fordism in high esteem, but so to did many other world leaders at this time, including the USSR of Stalin which practically enshrined Fordist/Taylorist industrial management as state doctrine.  The reality was of course far more complicated and part of the problem of examining American multinationals and the Third Reich was that of the latter's twelve-year existence, Germany was at peace with the US for eight of these years. American firms, like their German counterparts, found themselves having to adjust to a state predicated both on military expansion and a subordination of industry to the needs of the state. Most industrial leaders accommodated these demands, and more than a few profited from them, but many were uneasy with them. Even in giant German conglomerates like Krupp or Rheinmetall-Borsig which grew tremendously under state military contracts, their management found that they were no longer quite masters of their own house.

 But very much like American multinationals, German industrialists tended to find they could operate under the Third Reich. The state may have leveled varying controls over exports, raw materials, and profits, but many businesses in Germany, both German- and foreign-owned, felt confident enough to work within this system. Many larger industrial firms tacked to a long-range vision in which compliance with the state's immediate demands were an acceptable risk if it meant preserving their investments for when things had settled down in Germany. Internal documentation from companies like Degussa AG or Ford's various European subsidiaries were less concerned with the morality or ethics of using slave labor then they were with preserving trade secrets or future economic viability. Other business leaders were also in a degree of ideological resonance with *some* aspects of the dictatorship. While research by Henry Ashby Turner has shown that most German industrialists were not early backers of the NSDAP and preferred to more mainline nationalism of the DNVP, the idea that the Republic was anathema to a healthy German spirit was not uncommon among these circles.

932,AskHistorians,"If I look at the 1960’s, I can see a distinct style of fashion and furniture, as I can with the 70’s, 80’s, etc. Did ancient Romans have the same change of domestic tastes every decade, or did trends change on a slower basis?","So this will likely need someone more experienced or at least recently read on this subject to weigh in but I'll offer my recollection. Also, looking into my source I believe my class really only focused on the painting styles or at least I have a less vivid recollection of the other forms of art and decoration. 

Much work has been done in Pompeii to look into trends such as those you're after. Within excavated homes there have emerged 4 distinct styles of wall decoration (painting) which show an evolution and stylistic change making them very distinct from one to the next. Looking up a quick chart of reference homes and their dated paints, it appears that these trends stretched from ~175 BCE through the burial of Pompeii in 79 CE. I'd say it roughly breaks down as -

Style 1 - 75 or so years in vogue.
Style 2 - 120 or so years. 
Style 3 - 40 or so years
Style 4 - 30ish years (or until eruption)

These trends and the general evolution of the style was fascinating to me. I highly recommend looking into it further. The gist is that the first style was a trend carried over from Greece in which is was common to build with multi colored marble. Lacking this material, Roman homes would simply paint colors on the wall in either patterns or other patchwork blocks of solitary color. Second style added images to the painting, generally first enhancing the architectural appearance (arches or other flourishes) and extending to adding vistas as if you were looking through the wall into an open space or garden. Realism in depiction was somewhat sought after. The third style took this further and began to frame these images and relegate them into non standard areas of the wall (simply meaning not where you'd expect a window or other opening, often higher up) with other designs or colors implemented lower down. The depictions in the images began to also get more sureal in this phase. Fourth style, I honestly always had trouble distinguishing this one but I believe it was just a more contrasted version of third style, mainly an effort was taken to very much contrast pictorial flourish with the other decoration on the wall, and often blur where the art met the architectural enhancements or other framing. 

Anyway, I think it is safe to say that it is likely the Empire experienced a similar change of trends as it evolved and time went by. What's interesting to me is it seems this was speeding up in the first century CE though with Pompeii as an example we obviously don't have the long term data to confirm if this trend continues. As I'd imagine much of this decoration was much more work intensive and costly than today, not to mention general technology at the time making it likely much slower for trends to spread, I don't think it odd that it seems ~75-~40 years may have been more in line with the changes in trend.

Included in an amazing book of cross discipline and topical articles on Pompeii, the event, the history of excavation and a ton of insight that has been gathered about Roman life from the site. 'Th e World of Pompeii' edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss.

Pre-edit: browsing through the article on Mosaics and Stucco it appears these also followed similar changes in style. And I do now recall we touched on mosaic differences which I believe also went from more simple and decorative shapes/patterns and eventually moved towards more image based depictions of famous events as you may have seen in a museum. Unfortunately there's no awesome chart to give me an eyeball of change in trend over time. "
933,AskHistorians,Oxford University was established c. 1096. How have applications and admission processes changed throughout these past 900+ years?,"Okay, I know nothing about admissions to Oxford over the centuries ([but something about them in the Middle Ages](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5d8r64/oxford_university_was_established_c_1096_how_have/da2w7an/)), but let's clear up one thing:

*Oxford was not founded in 1096.*

I know the website says ""there was evidence for teaching at Oxord in 1096."" Let's talk about what that means, and why Oxford tries to mislead you.

The modern university system in the west is a creation of the high Middle Ages. The first formal evidence for *universitates* (sing. *universitas*) in Paris, Oxford, and Bologna all date from around 1200. Here, universitas is making the transition from referring to the group of people involved--basically a guild for regulating learning, with teachers as masters and students as apprentices--to the institution. But these universities did not come from nowhere.

In the eleventh century accelerating into the twelfth, learning in Europe was concentrated in the Church. Monastery schools training primarily their own monks or nuns are the most famous. But priests and minor clergy outside monastic orders also needed training. The system that evolved during these centuries favored individual master teachers with a wide reputation attracting students from their region or even farther away who came to them to study.

These masters weren't *only* teachers, those. They generally held at least one important benefice (position with income attached, generally in the form of taxes from land that came with the title), and they could move from position to position. Their students would follow.

In the twelfth century (1080-1215), not only did the number of students and the importance of the schools explode, the city of Paris became a major congregating spot for these intellectual masters and their students. We used to think the same was true of Bologna, specifically. Anders Winroth has recently argued, however, that the masters and the schools that developed around them and followed them around were actually spread throughout northern Italy during the 12th century, not concentrated in Bologna.

Why the massive increase? Schools were the primary producers of *literati*, that is, people literate in Latin, the language of governance in the West. This was the time when, very very slowly, governments were beginning to make more use of written documents. It was letters of communication and symbolic writing long before it was record-keeping for consultation, but the need for trained writers was growing. At the same time, the growth in government--Church and secular--was spurring stronger interest in organized laws to make governing easier. And Churchmen paying more attention to these ideals of order and analysis, along with a growing realization that the Church needed to reach more levels of the population to survive, spurred a lot more attention to *understanding* theology: to figuring out what, exactly, Christians believed out of a messy mass of theological writings that often disagreed with each other. So the work of the schools was on one hand to study things and produce texts to guide others, and on the other, to produce the clerics--the *clerks*--who would run governments.

The emphasis on the second of those, and the skyrocketing need to produce ever-more literate clerks and (after 1179, 1200, and *really* after 1215) trained preachers to instruct lay people prompted the establishment of longer-term institutions *not* tied to the whims of an individual master. Hence, after 1200, we start seeing charter (legal documents of land donation), civic law, and other references to formal universities at Paris, Bologna, and Oxford first of all.

Now, here's the thing. There is no ""official founding document"" for any of these, a common medieval situation. It's clear that the universities were *evolutions* out of pre-existing practice. At what point did a group of masters and students become a formal university? It's hard to say.

That means that Bologna, Paris, and Oxford can all claim to be the oldest university in the west. And guess what--oh, they do, they really do.

You can find medievalists today who will side with Paris or Bologna (Winroth's article ruffled some feathers among Italianists that I know, but that could be my limited sample), but Oxford's claim is actually the fishiest.

Oxford in the 11th century wasn't exactly a backwater, but it was no intellectual center. It made an economic role for itself as a convenient place to cross the Thames, basically, but the diocesan seat--and the well-regarded school that developed around its cathedral--were actually at Lincoln. However, the size and economic interest of Oxford could support a teacher and students. Theobald of Etampes (d. 1125ish) refers to himself as a ""master at Oxford"" in undated letters from around 1100. This is the earliest we hear about *teaching* at Oxford. Not any kind of formal, established school--just a master who had students.

There are other scattered references to individual masters throughout the twelfth century.  By ~1190, Gerald of Wales gave multiple lectures at Oxford, which he called a great center of learning. Gerald's writing is exceptionally interesting because he indicates that there is already a degree of hierarchy and specialization forming among the schools (which are still being referred to as the ""schools of Oxford,"" plural, in 1197). This means that in the 1190s, some degree of formalization and structure was developing, but we probably can't talk about a *universitas*.

But that doesn't stop modern pride from writing checks their sources can't cash. G.R. Evans' *University of Oxford: A New History* is a great example. In introduction to the medieval background chapter, she compares Oxford to Bologna/Italy:

> As to law, Irnerius (c.1050-1125) was a Bolognese lawyer who was apparently teaching Roman law at Bologna from the 1070s. Bologna's school was not a real *universitas* yet, merely a superior vocational college. How did scruffy little Oxford emerge at the forefront of this European movement almost as soon as it began?

The implication is clear. It's only later that Evans admits:

> Twelfth-century students would come [to Oxford] to study with a famous Master (*magister*) or teacher, not in a particular place; if the Master moved on, they would follow...There is no evidence yet of a continuous history or an institutionalized school.

Everyone wants to be first. No one can *prove* for sure who was, however, which allows Bologna, Paris, and Oxford to stake the claim."
934,AskHistorians,"Coffee was first cultivated in Ethiopia, first brewed as a drink in Yemen, and was first introduced to Europe by the Turks. How then did ""Java"", an Indonesian island, become the source of a popular name for the drink while no other place had that happen?","The short answer to your question is that the Dutch East India Company introduced coffee to Indonesia, began to cultivate it on the island of Java, and then imported this Javanese coffee into Europe in large amounts, controlling 50-70% of global coffee production during the second half of the eighteenth century (Kahin 2015:97). The history of the rise of Indonesian coffee can be traced, but the reason for the popularity of the slang “Java” has to be inferred.

In 1614, Dutch traders visited Yemen to explore the possibility of importing coffee to Europe.  Reportedly, no fertile coffee berries were allowed to leave Yemen unless they had first been steeped in boiling water or partially roasted.  So, they were the sole, or at least primary, source of imported coffee – even coffee in Turkey had been imported from Yemen.

In 1640, a Dutch merchant imported the first commercial shipment of coffee from Mocha to Europe, and regular imports of coffee from Mocha to Amsterdam began in 1663.

With the growing popularity of coffee in Europe, there were repeated attempts to find ways to grow it elsewhere.  A frequently quoted (but possibly apocryphal) story  claims that an Indian Muslim named Babu Budan smuggled seven seeds back from his pilgrimage to Mecca by ""strapping them to his belly.""  He is then said to have planted these seeds in the Changraigiri Hills which gave rise to India's coffee industry.  There is, however, no documentary evidence for this and the first mention of coffee in India is in 1695, so it is unlikely that this had a dramatic impact on coffee cultivation. (Wild, 1995: 98-100)

One account (Ukers 1922:43) is that the Dutch transplanted  Arabian coffee seedlings to Java in 1696.  They were destroyed by flooding, but a second shipment sent in 1699, succeeded.  A second (Pendergrast  1999: 7-9) is that in 1616 the Dutch obtained a coffee plant from Mocha or possibly Ethiopia (Abyssinia).  The plants were transported to the botanical garden in Amsterdam, and seeds from it were sent to Ceylon in 1658, perhaps with the intent of starting production there.  The initiative failed (possibly due to a lack of manpower).  Finally however, the coffee plantations in Java were established in 1699 with cuttings from Dutch plants from Malabar, India.

Once coffee had been transplanted in Java, the Dutch Company was able to begin cultivation and importation on a large scale.  As Dutch cultivation intensified, coffee in Europe was increasingly from Java and the nickname began to develop.  \[Except the Dutch apparently gave the French King a specimen of the coffee plant, which was then transplanted to French colonies undercutting the Dutch supply.\] An additional reason for its use in American English is that early importers of coffee into America were Dutch transplants from the Indies.  Alfred Peet, for example, who founded Peet’s Coffee and trained the founders of Starbucks, was a Dutchman who worked as a tea taster in the Indies (now Indonesia).  Though it is hard to prove definitively, these pioneers of specialty coffee in America may have fostered the association between coffee and Indonesia (Java).

935,AskHistorians,"I'm a Roman soldier fighting another Roman in the numerous civil wars. Do I feel remorse for fighting and killing my countrymen rather than the ""barbarians""? Or is the concept of ""countrymen"" anachronistic during Antiquity?","The obvious answer is that we do not know, the only texts we have from soldiers are the administrative chits and personal messages that survive in places like the deserts of Egypt and the anoxic muck of northern England, the formulaic inscriptions like tomb stones and discharge sheets, and incidental inscriptions like curse tablets (to be honest I am not certain about the last one). These are a fascinating source of information and provide a wealth of rich detail but they are focused on more mundane matters. We have messages from the soldiers of an Egyptian outpost clubbing together to rent the services of a prostitute, and soldiers trying to get out of duty rotations, but in much the same way that you probably don't write much about your thoughts on civil war in your daily life, neither did those Roman soldiers.

I am being very specific here because the Roman military did indeed form its own distinctive subculture, or I should say subculture**s**, much as members of modern militaries do. They even saw themselves as distinct and took pride in that--one famous story has Julius Caesar chastising his mutinous soldiers by addressing them as ""civilians"" (""Quirites""). So while we can easily say there are numerous examples of how Roman society writ large frowned on civil wars, as the other comment noted and as can be seen in other ways such as the effective ban of celebrating victory over other Romans that lasted through numerous wars until Constantine, it is worth pointing out that this is not the voice of the soldiers themselves.

The closest thing we have is a passage from Tacitus *Histories* (3.25, translation off Perseus) regarding the Battle of Cremona in the civil wars of the Year of Four Emperors:

>The conquerors, in the eagerness of pursuit, dispersed themselves over the entire line of road. The slaughter that followed was made particularly memorable through the murder of a father by his son. I will record the incident with the names, on the authority of Vipstanus Messalla. Julius Mansuetus, a Spaniard, enlisting in the legion Rapax, had left at home a son of tender age. The lad grew up to manhood, and was enrolled by Galba in the 7th legion. Now chancing to meet his father, he brought him to the ground with a wound, and, as he rifled his dying foe, recognized him, and was himself recognized. Clasping the expiring man in his arms, in piteous accents he implored the spirit of his father to be propitious to him, and not to turn from him with loathing as from a parricide. ""This guilt,"" he said, ""is shared by all; how small a part of a civil war is a single soldier!"" With these words he raised the body, opened a grave, and discharged the last duties for his father. This was noticed by those who were on the spot, then by many others; astonishment and indignation ran through the whole army, and they cursed this most horrible war. Yet as eagerly as ever they stripped the bodies of slaughtered kinsfolk, connexions, and brothers. They talk of an impious act having been done, and they do it themselves.

Vipstanus Messala was a generation older than Tacitus but the overlapped in age so this could either be a personal account or a later writing--or, because he was twenty years dead by the time the *Histories* were written, Tacitus could have made it up. But assuming he did not, as Messala was a commander in that war this could either be a real, literal event that happened or a camp legend that grew among the soldiers. Either way, it points towards the soldiers certainly having a different attitude towards killings in civil wars than in foreign wars. I would even go so far as to say that parallels to this story in other wars indicate a certain universality of this experience, of the literal kinslaying standing in for the metaphorical one.

Of course there is a nuance here: in 69 CE the last time Romans killed Romans in civil war was well out of living memory, Augustus' civil war was concluded more than 80 years ago in 27 BCE (the next full revolt would be even further off, in 195 CE, although there was a bloodlessly suppressed coup in 42 CE). The soldiers at Actium in 31 BCE, on the other hand, would have known little but civil war, as Caesar had crossed the Rubicon in 49 BCE, a mere 18 years earlier. It is not hard to imagine them having a different attitude towards civil war.

The Roman military is unusually blessed with rich source materials, but unfortunately is still subject to the same loss as elsewhere in the ancient world, and so we can't answer your question for certain. That said, I suspect they did not much like it."

937,AskHistorians,It's around 1000 C.E. in Europe. A man I don't recognize claims he is the new tax collector for my new lord. How do I know he is legitimate?,"From an [earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5jfc38/im_a_farmer_in_mid_10th_century_byzantium_and_a/dbg3fge/) on tax fraud and preventing it in 9th-10th century Byzantium, with some new information about England for comparison:

Distribution of land ownership and use in the rural Byzantine Empire was definitely not even. By the eleventh century, there were some very powerful large-scale landholders (including monasteries, although at least in urban areas, sometimes even a monastery was controlled by an aristocrat), a few small landowners hanging in there, and then most of the population would have been *paroikoi* or dependent peasants: tenant farmers. 

For the powerful landowners, including monasteries, tax collection was mostly a game of tax *evasion*. Tax collectors remained a popular bogeyman of Byzantine literature and art as they had been in Roman times, and this hostility was mirrored by practice. Owners might work to avoid periodic visits by imperial tax assessors to revaluate their land at a higher tax amount, pay their taxes using a debased currency, or send someone chasing after a tax collector to steal back the money. (Anna Komnene tells a similar story in her *Alexiad.*)

Most Byzantine people, however, were peasants who were responsible for paying their taxes (a) collectively and (b) often indirectly. The tenant farmers paid most of their tax burden to the owner of their land. In a case like that, they would presumably be fairly familiar with the people involved. Otherwise, taxes were levied collectively on a village. This had the advantage, for the peasants, of helping out if one family had a rough year. It had the disadvantage of--one of the reasons for this system--that local land abandoned or unfarmed was still part of the total levy for an area. So people had to cover for each other. But tax evasion was at least sometimes practiced by peasants--or at least, financial documents complain about peasants who simply *disappear* when they know a tax collector is in the area!

As for identifying the tax collectors themselves: at least some tax officials, most prominently the *kommerkiarioi* (who, as their name indicates, were involved with regulating commerce), had official imperial seals. [This Google Books preview](https://books.google.com/books?id=86Of2XxW2NMC&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=tax+collector&source=bl&ots=QrkuiQ01ca&sig=zyIlQMc72Xz_EP0bBx8c4pRfV40&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiZ3bmDioTRAhVJ5GMKHf9aCMgQ6AEINDAE#v=snippet&q=collector&f=false) shows a couple of them, although they are both ninth century. Seals were pretty serious business in medieval Europe. The collective payment and indirect payment methods certainly suggest that at least some of the people involved would have been able to recognize the seal for what it was (medieval peasants are, as a rule, stereotyped in contemporary sources as stupid, but at least from later legal sources we can see a good deal of ability to negotiate successfully the demands of a more literate and educated ""elite"" culture).

Later medieval English manors evolved their own effective system of preventing impostor tax collectors: have the peasants elect one of their own to the job. Out of all the options for compulsory extra service, this wasn't the worst one in the world: it usually gave the collector a chance to skim some off the top for themselves. Well, it wasn't the worst until the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, when rent-collectors might find themselves lumped in with the targets of rebel anger and weaponry."
938,AskHistorians,Karl Marx worked as a journalist for the New York Tribune for a decade (from 1852 to 1862). Would his American readers have been aware of his reputation as the author of The Communist Manifesto (1848) or his philosophical/political ideas?,"No, because the *Manifesto* had almost no impact when it was first published. It wasn’t even in print for most or perhaps all of this period. In fact, *Manifesto* had almost no impact for the first twenty-five years its existed, and only became really important when it was reprinted widely in Germany after in 1872. There was a small-run English-language edition published in London in 1850, but the *Manifesto* wasn’t even published in America (again, in a small edition) until 1871. 

See my full answer here:

 * [The Communist Manifesto was published today in 1848. What was the immediate reaction to the publication like?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7z6qhb/the_communist_manifesto_was_published_today_in/)

Marx himself became somewhat better known with the founding of the International Workingmen’s Association in 1864—for instance, when Marx wrote a letter congratulating Lincoln on his second electoral victory in the name of Workingmen’s Central Committee, the American ambassador responded (you can read both the letter and response [here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/iwma/documents/1864/lincoln-letter.htm))—but, while this letter was published in some American newspapers, Marx himself probably wouldn’t be a household name in Germany even until likely the 1870’s at the earliest and the rise of the first Social Democratic Party. The first *Communist* Party, we should add, wouldn’t gain prominence until the Russian Revolution in 1917, long after Marx’s death in 1883."
939,AskHistorians,Why are the musical notes named A B C D E F G in germanic languages and when did we started to use this system? Why are they not labeled as Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si like in Latin languages?,"Hi! Music Theory Prof. here.

The systems you're describing are actually two different systems of understanding pitch. The Do-Re-Mi system of solfege is an aural accompaniment to the written lettering A-B-C.

The writings of philosopher Boethius in *De institutione musical* is the nexus for understanding the formation of western music theory, including the concept that pitches would take on the letters A - G in written texts--a concept taken from Greek music scholars. From its publication ca. 492, it became the primary treatise for music theorists in the middle ages. The full history of western music's development of pitch systems is pretty nicely summed in Charles Atkinson's *The Critical Nexus*. The next \~1000 years are pretty messy for music theory, until what we now would recognize as functional harmony clicks into place between 1600-1750.

Medieval music practitioners were limited by lack of texts in circulation, particularly with regard to Catholic liturgical music, and perhaps more significantly, lack of a reliable notation system (it was a mess). Guido d'Arezzo in his *Micrologus* (ca. 1026) formulated what we now know as Solfege--a system to vocalize pitches within a mode. Vocalizing solfege syllables enabled him to teach liturgical music more quickly and effectively since most of it was largely memorized and passed through an oral system.  He's certainly not the first to develop solmization, but his original Ut Re Mi Fa So La system with the accompanying visual 'Guidonian Hand' is the direct antecedent to the system with which you're now comfortable. In Guido's day, Ut (we now call it Do) would have been the note G, positioned below the original A. This was the Gamma Ut.

Now, to the dissonance (ba-dum-tss) that you're experiencing. These two systems are typically taught complimentary of each other; however, it's not uncommon in European traditions to teach solmization instead of letter names when reading. The idea of 'C as Do' is a relatively recent development in western music, with its aim being to develop reliable relative pitch in (young) musicians and is given the moniker 'Fixed Do'. Solfege can also be used as a movable system, wherein Do is the first scale degree of whatever key (or mode) you're in: 'Movable Do'.

Written music is gradually becoming more 'C-based' since C Major is an easy key for students to start learning from. I doubt we'll reach the point of renaming pitches any time soon, but for many, C is already the primary starting point for notation, given its primacy in the circle of fifths, its central position on the piano, and its intuitive key construction.

I hope this helps--feel free to reach out if you want to get deeper into the weeds."
940,AskHistorians,"Both the Witcher 3 and Skyrim have mentions of lighthouses being tampered with to make ships crash. Was this ever a common issue, or are there any popular documented cases?","In short: No, there are no *popular* documented cases I am aware of, and it did not appear to be a common issue.

But that does not mean it or something similar *never* happened. I do have to say that my knowledge on the subject is specific to the Americas and England in the mid 1800s and later where lighthouse development became both far more common and far more effective with the development of the Fresnel lens. If there is something in classical antiquity that refers to such actions, I am unaware of them.

Salvaging from a shipwreck that has run aground is (or was) called wrecking. Technically this means getting salvage from a wreck, but the trope (or a form of it) is a *very* old one, and also tends to imply that they contributed to the wreck (that is, they were part of the wrecking, so to speak). This could actually be quite lucrative, depending on what exactly came up on the rocks. Key west Florida, for instance, was seeing nearly a wreck a week in the mid 1800s, recording 48 wrecks in 1848 alone.

To discuss your question, we have to discuss the *other* option for tampering with lighthouses. Perhaps the most interesting part of the current version of the trope - to turn the lighthouse off - is that it is an inverse of the original form. The original literary trope concerned False Lights. To give an example: The [town of Nag's Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nags_Head,_North_Carolina) North Carolina is (at least from the local folklore) named after the practice of putting a lantern on a mule or horse (the Nag in question) and marching them up or down the coast, thereby fooling a ship into thinking they were drifting in some way, which would make them change direction and run aground. Despite the folklore surrounding the practice, there are no actual records of it *working* there. In fact, there are no shipwrecks associated with deliberate False Lights that I can find, except in fiction.

This version of the trope is not simply present in folklore, it was a common literary trope, appearing again and again, and in different places. Cathryn J. Pearce in *Cornish Wrecking, 1700—1860: Reality and Popular Myth,* for instance, mentions it several times throughout the book, but notes that she was unable to find any evidence at all that it ever actually took place. This is consistent with what John Viele notes in The Wreckers: The Florida Keys Volume 3. No captain of a ship in the Florida Keys (once a very common spot for wreckers) *ever* suggested that he had been fooled by a false light, at least that was ever reporting in an Admiralty court. This makes sense, of course: A false light would be low in the water, would not likely be very powerful, and if anything, ships are likely to move *away* from the light, given that a Lighthouse is supposed to be on land, after all. After the development of the Fresnel lens, it would be even less likely that one could mistake an oil lamp as even a far away lighthouse.

We do have a solid example of where false lights (or...inaccurate lights? False lights in this context implies subterfuge) *did* cause a series of wrecks in England. In the case of The Durham Lights, for which a number of wrecks are attributed from 1864 to 1870, captains described a light a distance above the horizon such that it looked like a lighthouse, or was at least high enough to appear to be such, and appeared to move. In all cases where it was mentioned, it happened during foggy/misty weather, especially during winter or when it was otherwise cold. The wrecks are historical, but many of the sources like to attribute it to some sort of mystical phenomena. However, the cold temperatures which seemed to be universal for the lights to operate would have been necessary for the formation of a superior mirage. Fata Morgana seems far more likely given the nature of the lights than any particular unscrupulous wreckers, given how the light was described.

At some point, and I am uncertain exactly when, the trope twisted: Now it was not false lights that lured ships to their doom, but rather a lack of lights. I can only assume that people picked up on what John Viele noted about the practice and decided to utilize something more likely to actually lead to a grounded ship, and here is where the historical accuracy gets less clear. A mention of not fully lighting the lighthouse in order to make a ship run around is explicitly mentioned in *The Lighthouse at the End of the World* By Jules Verne at the start of chapter 11 (Titled ""The Wreckers"" appropriately enough), which was published in 1905, with the first draft in 1901. This is simply an example of fiction, of course, if you happen to be unaware of who Jules Verne was.

As for a source for the idea of extinguishing a lighthouse in order for ships to run aground, as far as I am aware there is one specific primary source from which most of the justifications for it being something that actually happened spring, and it is not an exact one. It reappears again and again in books on wreckers, and I had originally thought it attributed to a different source before I found the original.

An excerpt from *A tour through the British West Indies in the years 1802 and 1803, giving particular Account of the Bahama Isles*, Daniel McKinnen, published 1805, is below:

>They are minutely known only to those persons called wreckers, who are licensed by the governor of the Bahamas, and cruise amongst those islands for the benefit of salvage, which they receive on all property they by chance to rescue from the waves. Some cocoa-nut trees have lately been planted on one of these keys, as a warning to mariners; but it is doubted whether the wreckers, whose business it is to prey on the disasters of the unwary, will suffer them to grow up, even should the soil permit.

>Happening in the course of one of my passages through the Bahamas, to fall in with a wrecker, I held as long a conversation with him as his haste would permit, and was inquisitive on the subject of his occupation. I will set down the dialogue as it took place.

>Q. From whence came you?

>A. (as it caught my ear) from Providence - Last from Philimingo Bay in Icumey, (a familiar way of pronouncing Flamingo Bay, in Exuma).

>Q. Where are you bound to?

>A. On a racking voyage to Quby (Cuba) and the westward.

>Q. Are there many of you in this quarter?

>A. Morgan, I, and Phinander (Fernandez): - parted company awhile ago.

>Q. What success in cruising?

>A. Middling, but middling.

>Q. We have seen very few wreckers to the eastward - are there many to the westward?

>A. We lay with forty sail four months along Floriday shore.

>Q. Forty sail! Then certainly you must have had many opportunities of being essentially serviceable to vessels passing the gulf stream, by directing them to keep off from places of danger, with which you made it your business to become acquainted?

>A. Not much of that - they went on generally in the night.

>Q. But then you might have afforded them timely notice, by making beacons on shore, or showing your lights?

>**A. No, no (laughing): we always put them out for a better chance by night.**

>Q. But would there not have been more humanity in showing them their danger?

>A. I did not go there for humanity: I went racking.

Emphasis mine. Note, though, that they speak of extinguishing *their own* lights, not subverting a lighthouse. Of course, the oldest lighthouse I am aware of in the Bahamas is the Hog Island lighthouse, built in 1817, over a decade after the above was published, which rather limits the opportunity. 

Overall, the problem with the profession of wrecking is that it traditionally was looked upon as a profession for scavengers and profiteers, and as such much worse deeds were often attributed to them than were likely ever true. After all, they were profiting from the result of disasters that had caused human suffering and loss of life. In such cases it is easy to attribute darker actions and motives to people. There is, however, a difference between robbing a grave and killing someone during a robbery.

What is clear is that, given how little actual evidence we have on the practice, it certainly wasn't common, and it also was not a major problem. In the places that actually had enough shipwrecks to justify a large concentration of wreckers, actions that may draw legal attention to the wreckers would be counter-productive for them, given that (as in the Bahamas) they were often licensed in some way. In places that *didn't* have enough, there would be no certainty whatsoever that taking out a lighthouse would actually lead to a ship becoming wrecked, and tampering with a lighthouse is generally illegal."
941,AskHistorians,When people state that 'Castro killed thousands of people while Dictator of Cuba' what events or sequences of events are they actually referring to?,"This is a really difficult question to answer because of both a lack of sources (at least, sources which allow for precise answers) and because of the vested interests of the parties involved. I will limit myself to focusing on the issue of government murder of Cubans, not mistreatment of the Cuban population, as another thread of mine on that subject has already been linked to elsewhere in the comments.

The Cuban government tends to use silence or out of hand dismissals with no evidence as the first line of defense against criticisms. When, for example, the UMAP labor camps of 1965-1968 detained thousands of Cubans (for political reasons, because they were gay, because they liked rock music which was 'bourgeois', etc.), they only responded once the international outcry had reached a fevered pitch, in 1968. Before that they either tried to hide them or offer excuses for them. After the closure of the camps, they tend to be silent on them and *if* they are brought up they merely say 'but they're closed! Why are you focusing so much on the past! Everyone makes mistakes!' They have also failed to make relevant documents public, likely because these would implicate government officials who are not only still alive but perhaps still in power.

Now, we know about the camps due to numerous eyewitnesses, the admission of the government at the time, Fidel Castro's personal [admission](http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/08/31/mundo/026e1mun) on the record in 2010 to Mexico's *La Jornada*, and Raul Castro's daughter Mariela Castro discussing them [publicly](http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=115462).

This is a point I'd like to emphasize. As secretive as the Castro regime was about the UMAP and despite attempts to strangle accusations against it based on the UMAP, we have plenty of evidence that they existed.

Regarding mass killings, we know about the numerous shootings of Batista regime cronies at the beginning of the Revolution, there do not seem to be any mass killings under the Revolution.

The historiography around this event is complex because the trials against those accused of committing crimes under the Batista regime do not seem to have been fair. They were showtrials to give swift 'justice', satisfy public demands of vengeance against a regime which killed thousands (perhaps tens of thousands) in 7 short years, and keep extra-judicial revenge killings to a minimum. After the dictator Gerardo Machado fled Cuba in 1933, his supporters were sometimes dragged from their homes and beaten to death in the street. Swift showtrials were thought to satisfy public demands for vengeance while channeling them against people who were often or likely guilty.

The other side of the coin being that critics of the trials say that *pagaron los justos por pecadores* (the just paid as if they were sinners); people who were innocent or were complicit only to a degree that fell well short of the need to execute them were mixed in with genuine criminals.

Unfortunately, while I'm aware of the point-counterpoint here, I've not been able to study this topic in sufficient depth to weigh both sides. I'm not even entirely sure if sufficient documents from these trials have been released to the public to be able to reach a serious conclusion one way or the other.

After these showtrials, there do not appear to be any mass murder or execution of Cubans by the government. If someone has evidence to the contrary, I am willing to review it, but I have not seen anything approaching proof of mass killings.

The only event which possibly qualifies is the so called *lucha contra bandidos* (struggle against bandits), fought in the Escambray mountains throughout much of the 1960s. While the government called them bandits, they were in reality an anti-Communist guerrilla force. The movement which had brought Castro to power had been very heterogeneous. Some were simply Liberal reformers who wanted to overthrow Batista and restore the Constitution of 1940 (Huber Matos comes to mind). When the government turned openly Communist and Fidel assumed dictatorial powers, some fled into exile, others were jailed on trumped up charges (as happened to Huber Matos), and still others took up arms and fought in the Escambray mountains. There were numerous deaths during this period, but as far as I'm aware nothing approaching the large numbers killed in the 1959 showtrials. These were also not hits against civilians, but rather military suppression of an armed rebellion. A disingenuous author might count them though.

The Cuban government has, by and large, preferred jailing its opponents over outright killing them. As some victims attest in the documentary *Conducta Impropia*, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oATGXqa69TA), the conditions for political opponents could be harsh indeed.

However, jailing and mistreating people =/= as outright murdering them.

Occasionally, the death penalty has been applied for political reasons, from the infamous Ochoa Affair (*caso Ochoa*) in which a Cuban government official was discovered to have engaged in drug trafficking or the execution of several men in 2003 after they attempted to hijack a ship to flee Cuba.

It isn't in the Cuban government's interest to release records which might show extrajudicial murders of any kind, so we don't exactly have much documentary evidence to go on. The Cuban government lacks the equivalent of the US' FOIA program. In addition, many of the same individuals are in power, so the implications of that kind of documentation would definitely have major ramifications. 

On the other hand, Cuban exiles and Cuban Americans don't often have the best information on what is actually going on in Cuba. Some adopt tinfoil hat theories, like  claiming the Cuban state forces women to undergo abortions if their fetuses have birth defects, and others simply take the truly repressive climate of decades ago and assume things are the same now. The US government gives millions of dollars a year to anti-Castro democracy programs, including TV and Radio Marti (channels blocked in Cuba). They have a very vested interests in painting the regime as being monstrous because it both jibes with their personal prejudices, keeps the faucet of US government support flowing, and primes public opinion for future regime change in Cuba.

My point is, take all claims about Cuba (both those in favor of the regime and those against it) with a grain of salt. And in terms of the more outrageous claims, always remember that unlike North Korea, you can visit Cuba and speak to anyone you'd like.

Sorry this answer isn't as in-depth and well documented as I'd like, but I hope it gives you a window into this issue.

942,AskHistorians,"While living, Muhammad chose Ali as his successor. But some followers met while Ali was at his funeral and decided that Abu Bakr would be their leader, and their actions caused Ali's wife (Muhammad's daughter) to miscarry and die. Why did many Muslims nevertheless accept the succession of Abu Bakr?","I'll start by mentioning that I have an MA in Muslim Societies and Civilizations. The event you're speaking about is *the* seminal moment that split the Muslim community into Shia and Sunni groups. 

On the Prophet's farewell pilgrimage, he orders his followers to stop at the Pond of Khumm (Ghadir Khumm). Here, the Prophet is reported to have said: ""Man Kuntu Mawlahu, fa Aliyyun Mawlahu"" which translates to ""He whose Mawla I am, Ali is his Mawla."" 

The difference of opinion occurred in how the word Mawla itself was interpreted by the two groups. The one group, which became the Sunni, interpreted this to mean ""friend"", whereas the group who became the Shia interpreted this to mean lord or master. 

It's worth noting here what the two terms, Sunni and Shia actually mean. The full form of Shia is Shi'at Ali, which can be loosely translated as the ""party"" or ""supporters"" of Ali. On the other hand, the full form of Sunni is the Ahl al-Sunna, which can be translated as the people of the Sunna. The Sunna refers to the example of the Prophet.

The major distinction between the two groups is the role of the Imam. In Sunni Islam, each mosque will have their own Imam. The Imam is in charge of spiritual and worldly guidance. There are also various figures who make rulings on religious matters, usually holding the concept of consensus to form opinions on a matter. On the other hand, the Shia believe that Ali was the only legitimate successor of the Prophet, and therefore their Imam. Ultimately, the idea is that while revelation stopped with the Prophet, the need for continued *divine* guidance was necessary. For the Shia, the position of Imam is hereditary. Within the Shia too there are various groups, who have various understandings of Imamat. I'm not going to go into this, but I will if you'd like.

Now, with the context out of the way, let me tackle your question. Abu Bakr and Ali were both close companions of the Prophet. Ali was also Muhammad's cousin, and son-in-law. The story goes, that at the death of the Prophet, Ali is sitting with Muhammad's body, while Abu Bakr and Umar (another of the Prophet's companions) are at the Saqifa (meeting hall) in Medina trying to consolidate power for themselves. However, we must remember a couple of things. First, Abu Bakr is respected by everyone, not just one group or the other. He is one of the Prophet's closest companions! The second thing to consider is that while Islam certainly took power away from the tribes to some degree, this is context was one of tribal politics. The elder was usually the chief, and Abu Bakr was naturally respected as he was quite old by this time. Ali was in his early 30s. Imagine from a normal individual's perspective. If you had to choose between someone who had wisdom, experience, etc. versus someone who was a young up and comer. When Abu Bakr became the first Caliph of the Shia, Ali himself gave allegiance to him, even though some sources say that he did this reluctantly. 

Both figures are respected as the Prophet's companions by both groups, though the Shia hold on to the idea that Ali was the *rightful* successor of Muhammad. If you would like to know more about the splits between these two groups, I would recommend learning about Husayn (the Prophet's grandson, and Ali's son) at Karbala.

Addendum: Wow, lots of questions coming out of this. I'm quite busy with work over the next couple of days but will get to responding to everyone when I can!"
943,AskHistorians,"In ww1, when a trench was hit with mustard gas, did that temporarily solve its lice and rat problems?","Mustard gas is certainly lethal to rats, not to mention other small critters that inhabited the hellish landscape of the front. Plenty of data exists on *exactly* what mustard gas, not to mention just about any other hazardous chemical, will do to a rat as they of course are often the laboratory subjects for tests to determine exactly that, not to mention countless other unfortunate creatures like mice, pigs, dogs, horses, and so on. The super short summary though if we cut to the chase for the LD50 of mustard gas, as that was the one you mentioned (although 
I presume you are interested more in WWI chemical warfare than *mustard gas*, so will also speak more generally about the former's impact), it is as follows:

Species | Route | LD50 (mg/kg)
---|---|---
Human | Oral | 0.7
Human | Dermal | 100
Rat | Oral | 17
Rat | Dermal | 5

Other gases too, of course, were tested on rats and other animals, both during and long after the war. In a report from 1917 by the British Chemical Warfare Medical Committee, we see several examples of this:

>Field experiments have shown that a rat and rabbit placed about five yards from, and to leeward of, a bomb  containing phosgene were found dead within eight minutes after its  explosion. Control animals similarly situated to windward died after  several hours. Other controls, in which shells filled with water instead  of toxic substances were used, have shown that the concussion must  not be regarded as a cause of death. 

>Similar results have been obtained in laboratory experiments at  Cambridge and elsewhere. Mice exposed to a high concentration of  phosgene in a small closed chamber may die during the third minute. 

The rats knew the danger the gas posed too. One of the warnings of an incoming attack for the soldiers in the trenches would be the fuzzy stampede as the rats which had been inhabiting No Mans Land fled in front of the oncoming clouds that drifted towards the trench, their squeaks of terror amplifying the official alarms. The aftermath would see the carcasses of rats strewn about, as well as other small mammals and avian life that had been eking out a survival there, or was forced into the trench of course, such as horses of dogs. A British study done in the wake of the war noted of one German attack carried out in early 1916, believed to be a mix of chlorine and phosgene:

>Grass and other vegetation were turned yellow by the gas as far back as 1 ,200 yds. from the front line. Rats were killed in the trenches in large numbers. Eleven cows, twenty-three calves, one horse, one pig, and fifteen hens were  killed in the fields behind the lines by gas, and a number of other cattle and pigs showed signs of being affected by the gas.

Speaking of a different attack, a British officer described the image of the rats much more vividly when he wrote of what a gas attack did to them:

>The trenches swarmed with rats, big rats, small rats, grey rats, tall rats in every stage of gas poisoning! Some were sucrrying along scarcely affected while others were slowly dragging themselves about trying to find a corner in which to die. A most horrid sight - but very good riddance.

Good riddance indeed, as the rats were considered quite a scourge of the trench, and soldiers found that one of the few things that had *any* impact on their presence was the enemy, whether gas as above, or the explosions of artillery or grenades sending them scurrying away. It wasn't exactly a good trade-off, all in all though, since as made clear enough, even a gas attack could hardly be counted on to result in total lethality, and the ever common presence of heavenly conditions was sure to bring new rats in short order, likely a large contribution to literally millions of causalities in the war from the diseases they so easily spread.

After the war, men who had gained experience in chemical warfare in the war likely remembered the devastation that their weaponry had wrought on the local fauna, and in the 1920s attempts were made to 'pacify' gas warfare and introduce it as the newest way to protect crops from vermin and pests. The US Chemical Warfare Service conducted several tests in conjunction with the government on the promise that it offered ""the quickest and surest method in attacking crop destroying pests, whether ground squirrels, gopher, blackbird, crows, buzzard, rats, or grasshopper"". 

Tests specifically aimed at rats were conducted in 1920 in the Gulf, in hopes of containing bubonic plague, and early reports claimed to be a rousing success with the use of a mixture of phosgene and chlorine gas. But testing in a contained 900 sq. foot area isn't the same as wide application, and the transition never was successfully made. Overall, such attempts to reapply chemical warfare to the civilian world showed that results were at best contained to the test conditions or short-lived, and in some cases quite counterproductive.

One attempt at tent caterpillar extermination found that it was killing the plants too. Other gasses were found to be ineffective, and the ones that worked best were of course the ones that were worst for humans as well. And the most desired target, the boll weevil, proved to be impervious to whatever was thrown its way as it simply could survive without breathing. Nevertheless it did help lay the groundwork for research that would eventually lead to more successful pesticides, even if not from the Chemical Warfare Service.

Now, as for lice, I would on the whole have to defer to someone else to note if there was any impact. I can make some guesses, but I wouldn't want to speculate. I would simply note that there is some very promising titled material in the National Archives which seem to be undigitized in the Records of the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, especially ""*Report on Experiments Conducted on October 16, 1918, Testing the Effect of Certain Toxic Gases on Body Lice and Their Eggs*"" in Record Group 7.

944,AskHistorians,"A lot of Americans talk about pride in their Scottish heritage or Irish heritage, but their seems to be very little talk of Welsh heritage. Why is this?","The celebration and/or recognition of ethnicity in the United States is a tricky matter. When it comes to people of European descent, a great deal of it comes down to choices of the participants and the community. This is particularly true of Protestant British immigrants: these people could blend in and become ""Americans"" - looking and acting a lot like white Americans who had been settled on the continent for generations, or they could decide to emphasize their origin. 

I find an article, now nearly fifty years old, to be particularly useful: Stanford M. Lyman and William A. Douglass, ""Ethnicity: Strategies of Collective ad Individual Impression Management,"" Social Research 40:2 (Summer 1973). Lyman and Douglass refer to two types of ethnic characteristics – the innate and the voluntary. In other words, if an emigrant arrives off the boat looking like white America, that person as no ""innate"" features that cause for identification other than an accent or clothing, perhaps. These can be shed more or less rapidly, and so that person is left with the matter of ethnic identification as a voluntary thing. The fact that an emigrant arrives as a likely native speaker of English (that wasn't always the case with the Welsh and Scots), blending in was relatively easy. 

Emigrants without English as a native language arrived with an innate feature that made them stand out, and so learning English was a high priority: I have known Scandinavian immigrants whose eldest children knew the language of their homeland, but the youngest ones never heard anything but English in their households: the urge to blend in can be fierce for immigrants as they attempt to shed ""innate"" features such as language.

For the Irish, religion represented an ""innate"" feature that locked in their ethnicity. Because of prejudice against Irish immigrants, who arrived in a demographic tsunami with the Potato Famine, beginning in 1846, these people could not easily blend in; their best chance was to celebrate their ethnicity and to operate as a collective, demonstrating their strength in numbers.

In the book, The Gilded Age, Mark Twain's Patrique Oreille (pronounced O-reLAY) was a Catholic who spoke with a French accent, choosing that ethnicity as a way to ascend the American ethnic ladder, even though he was born in Ireland and named Patrick O'Riley. Irish immigrants did not normally attempt this transformation and were generally faced with embracing their ethnicity or shedding their religion, which was out of the question for most. The saga of the Kennedy family is a multi-generational expression of what it meant to be Irish in a Protestant-dominated Boston, and how working together and never forgetting one's Irish roots could prove to be the best means to achieve in an oppressive environment.

So what of the Protestant British emigrants? Who decided to be ""ethnic"" and who did not? In [an article I published in 1994](https://www.academia.edu/39021186/Defining_the_Group_Nineteenth-Century_Cornish_on_the_North_American_Frontier), I  compared Cornish and Irish immigrants in a Western Mining District. I attempted to demonstrate that the Irish immigrants used their large numbers (they represented about a third of the mining district) to exert political control of local government. The Cornish were a smaller minority, but they were prized by mine owners because of their legendary expertise underground. The Cornish, as protestant, native-speakers of English, could have blended in. Instead, they tended to make a decision to emphasize their ethnicity - a ""voluntary"" decision since they lacked any remarkable ""innate"" ethnic cues, and by being ethnic, they could capture the best jobs. But the Cornish expressed their ethnicity in a clever way, aligning themselves with the native, white Americans: while the Irish formed militias named after heroes of the Irish struggle against Britain (with the hope of returning to Ireland to fight for independence), the Cornish organized themselves with a militia called the ""Washington Guard."" They were sending a clear message: we are Cornish, we are distinct (meaning you should employ us!), and yet we are good Americans who do not intend to leave the country to fight for foreign causes. It was a clever way to drive a wedge to separate the Irish immigrants from the ""Americans"" - all the while having the Cornish maintaining their ethnicity AND taking the side of ""real Americans."" That choice on the part of the Cornish tended to evaporate as soon as preferential hiring in the mines was no longer a factor. Cornish immigrants who were no longer involved in mining tended to ""blend in"" - although there are still Cornish-American organizations, they are relatively invisible for the rest of the nation, and attendance is limited.

The Scots present a slightly different matter. Their names (and their Presbyterian religion) can be obvious ""cues"" that make their ethnicity innate rather than voluntary. Perhaps most important was the fact that the Scots gained in prestige as an ethnicity in Britain throughout the nineteenth century. Following the disastrous efforts to place a descendant of James I of England/James VI of Scotland on the British throne with rebellions in 1715 and 1745, the Scots and Highland culture underwent a rehabilitation and transformation, where to be Scottish was regarded as a positive thing in Britain. This found an echo in North America. The fact that the Scots arrived in far greater numbers than the Cornish, for example, meant that the Scots often had something of a critical mass that allowed them to gather as a group and celebrate their ethnicity - an ethnicity that was counted as a positive in part because of the transformation that occurred in Britain. While the Scots had few - and relatively insignificant - innate features, but they had motivation to voluntarily boast their ethnicity because it gained them prestige in the community.

The Welsh represent a different issue. The traditional Welsh, Methodist coal miner of Britain was not despised by his British cousins - as were the Irish Catholics. That said, the people living in Wales were not honored in English popular perception in the way that the Scots were: Victoria had her Balmoral estate in Scotland, but there was no counterpart in Wales. The royal court paraded around in kilts, but there was no Welsh equivalent. In North America, Welsh immigrants were faced with much the same ethnic choice as faced the Cornish: as protestants and (generally) native speakers of English, the Welsh could blend in and become ""good"" Americans. Although they were renowned as expert coal miners, there was little incentive to be noticed in the low-paying coal industry of the Eastern US; by contrast, the Cornish tended to emigrate to the West and worked in high-paying precious metal mines where their expertise/ethnicity could be emphasized to gain even better paying positions. Because of this, there was less economic incentive to emphasize one's Welsh origins, and there was little by way of innate factors that would force their recognition. As a result, the Welsh had become much like the modern Cornish: while there are Welsh-American organizations, participation is limited and the groups - like the participants - tend to be ethnically invisible for the rest of white America.

edit: I see this is very (too!) long: to summarize: economic and social factors encouraged the Scots and Irish to celebrate their ethnicity (although those reasons manifested very differently for the two groups); for the Welsh, there was less economic and social reason to put their origins forward, so they tended to blend into white Protestant America.

945,AskHistorians,"What are the historical origins of homophobia? From what I understand, homosexuality used to be considered just a normal thing in classical Greece and Rome and the like, how and why did homosexuality stop being accepted and homophobia come to be?","So the fabulous /u/sunagainstgold has us covered for the Middle Ages, but your question touches on classical Greece and Rome directly, so its worth mentioning what happened in these places between the height of the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages.  In between this space lies ""Late Antiquity"", and its when things just kinds stopped making sense.

The defining change of the Roman Empire from Classical to Late Antiquity was the conversion of the government, if not the people at large just yet, to Christianity.  Along with this change Kyle Harper argues in *From Shame to Sin* that attitudes towards homosexual behavior between men were fundamentally altered.

Firstly, Harper argues that we need to understand same sex relationships between men in the high Empire are not necessarily the same as a free acceptance of homosexuality. Instead the ""acceptable"" forms of same sex expression in the Late Roman world were invariably between masters and slaves, not free born men (and I do mean men, women feature between very rarely and not at all in ancient discourses on same sex relations). Indeed, seducing a free born man into sex with a man was a severe crime in Roman Law even before conversion to Christianity, this was not the Greek approach between men that was seen in Athens and the like in the 4th century BC.  Secondly the survival of these master slave relations in the Roman Empire was also predicated on the widespread sexual availability of slaves through brothels.  This point is worth underscoring.  Without the widespread sexual availability of slaves to their masters, through both private ownership as well as through the sex trade, there was no Roman approach to homosexuality. 

When Christianity became the prevailing ideology of the empire in the 4th century sexual slavery and public prostitution were heavily frowned upon, as in ""could result in public execution"" levels of frowned on. Over the course of the next several centuries various emperors would outlaw or suppress both sexual slavery and same sex relationships. The emperor Theodosius oversaw the public burning of male prostitutes in Rome and later Justinian would pass harsh laws condemning the sale of people into sexual slavery against their will. He condemned people participating in prostitution as well but the prevailing idea was that if you weren't being forced into the life you were legally culpable, so non-enslaved prostitutes were also targeted by Justinian's reforms.

These legal developments went hand in hand with Christian developments of the will and the relationship between sexuality and the will. Harper concludes that over time the Christian ideas and messages seeped into the broader society through a top down implementation of strict anti-same sex relationships that ultimately derived from the letters of Paul that were used by rabble rousing bishops in Constantinople for example.  

Over time however this focus lost much of its impact and focus and as we enter into the Medieval period Roman law collapses in much of their former territory and it is more difficult to understand the approaches that these successor kingdoms (with the exception of the Eastern Romans) took towards homosexual behavior.  In some non-post-Roman contexts there is still some evidence, such as the Norse people of the Early Middle Ages who also seemed to share a dismal approach towards same sex relationships.  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5vb166/how_did_pagan_vikings_in_the_813th_centuries_view/de1bo9q/ here is a post on this topic from the aforementioned /u/sunagainstgold )"
946,AskHistorians,"Vampires aren't real, but ""vampires burials"", where the dead are interred in some strange manner in order to prevent their rising again, occurred infrequently in Medieval Europe. Do historians have a theory as to what was really wrong with the people who were buried in this manner?","My area of research is medieval/early modern English death rituals rather than Poland specifically. Your question states that you are interested in 'Europe', so I hope an answer based on English practices is of at least some help.

In terms of English burial practices, these 'vampire' burials are often the result of a suicide. A key bit of context here lies in understanding beliefs about the dead body. In both pre and post Reformation theology, the body continues to be of great importance even after death, as it is the earthly remains which will be resurrected into holy bodies on Judgement Day (see 1 Corinthians 15:35-58). Though body and soul have been separated, the body is still of central importance to the departed (one of the reasons that Catholic funerals tend to involve burial, not cremation, in order to receive the best chance of resurrection).

This leads to a situation which can seem a little bizarre to the modern mind, wherein individuals can be punished *after* their death through ill-treatment of their corpse. Famously, Oliver Cromwell and other figures involved in the regicide of Charles I were disinterred from their graves in order to be 'posthumously executed' (in this case, by beheading). ^1

Suicide was regarded as one of the most unforgivable crimes in early modern England. It represented a rejection of God's gift of life, with no opportunity to repent - it was an assured route to Hell, and an enormous shame to the community, where even the living relatives of the suicide would be punished. A posthumous coroner’s jury would try cases of suicide, and if found guilty, the individual in question would have all of their movable goods and any leases on land surrendered to the crown, or a holder of a royal patent which granted them the right to such windfalls. ^2

When it came to interring the body of a suicide, several considerations are at play. It was considered so important to be buried 'decently' (involving proper covering of the corpse in a shroud, a peal of bells, and a minister to officiate) that even if a corpse of a stranger were to be found within the parish, funds would be raised to have them buried decently in consecrated ground. ^3 This decency was not afforded to a suicide. At best, they could be expected to be buried just outside of the consecrated land of the churchyard, but there are also numerous cases of the 'vampire burials' you describe.

Burial at a crossroads was considered to be a particularly apt site for the burial of a suicide. It lacked the respect and reverence of a consecrated site, where the body would constantly be travelled over by traffic. A stake was often driven through the body in such burials. Two factors are at play here - the denial of Christian burial, and the playing out of superstitious beliefs about the unquiet dead. This process of 'vampire'-style burial served as a warning to the community and defiled the sinful body, but also had practical considerations designed to ensure that the harmful influence of suicide did not remain within the community – the stake prevented the ghost from walking, and the crossroads were intended to diffuse the evil influence of the defiled body in order to reduce the harm it could cause.^3

It's outside the scope of my field to answer what other causes may produce this type of burial, and whether the motivations were significantly different in other parts of Europe. However, in England at least, these style burials are closely associated with punishing a suicide, and preventing harm to the remaining community.

Let me know if you have any questions!

947,AskHistorians,Is there any evidence of “theme park” type attractions in ancient civilisations?,"The answer depends on how we interpret the question. What is a theme park?

If we're looking specifically for ""something resembling water slides, slippery dips, rope swings, or anything else built solely for physical thrills,"" then the simple answer is no, there was nothing like this in Antiquity. 

If you were an Ancient Greek looking for physical thrills, you'd go to the gymnasion (usually an enclosed field, maybe with some rooms for dressing down and oiling up) and try your hand at boxing, wrestling, throwing the javelin or the discus, running, or jumping with weights. The most daring would try to specialise in the *pankration*, a fighting sport that was regularly lethal. If you were rich, you might get yourself a racehorse - or nag your dad for a racehorse, which was enough of a theme in rich Athenian families for the comedian Aristophanes to make fun of it in his plays. Traditionally the most thrilling activity for the rich had been racing in two- or four-horse chariots, but by the Classical period this was generally outsourced to a sponsored charioteer for major competitions like the Olympic Games. Hunting was another classic thrill-seeking activity, and one that many authors considered good preparation for war, since it trained physical endurance and good reflexes as well as cunning and teamwork. The most common game was the hare. 

Of course there were many activities that the Greeks engaged in that we would consider to be somewhere in the gray area between gambling, thrill-seeking and violent indulgence - dog-fighting and cock-fighting being the more civil varieties, raiding and piracy the more aggressive ones. Very rich Greeks of the Archaic period seem to have owned their own fifty-oared ships, which they used in the off-season of farming (May-June) to go out for raiding or trading, as the mood took them. A scene from the Odyssey, in which a recently landed ship's crew is warily asked whether they have come to raid or trade, shows that the decision could be taken on a whim. Later on, activities of this sort were mostly monopolised by the state.

During religious festivals, large parts of the territory might take on more of a ""theme park"" feel, with processions going from the urban centre to distant sanctuaries, and both urban and rural sanctuaries becoming the site of public offerings and feasts. The entertainment was largely in the parade, the ritual and the public meal, though certain festivals came with theatre performances of new plays (the Athenian Dionysia and Lenaia) or elaborate dance performances (f.ex. the Spartan Gymnopaideia and Hyakinthia). Since spaces like theatres and open-air altars were built for the purpose, you could argue that the Greek city itself had a significant entertainment element in it. Later on, the Romans would build their own amphitheatres (for gladiator shows etc.) as well as hippodromes for chariot races.

But we can find more interesting things if we stretch the concept of the theme park a little bit. If we interpret it not as a space with rides and physical activities, but as a purpose-built leisure area, there are many examples from the ancient world. The possibly historical Hanging Gardens of Babylon are a prime example; more reliably attested are the lavishly landscaped Persian gardens, which the Greeks called *paradeisoi* and from which the English language gets the word ""paradise"".  These were walled spaces, carefully organised according to pre-drawn plans, filled with water features and rare trees, which were intended as a place of peaceful refuge for Persian nobility or as a way to seclude and beautify sacred spaces. Greeks who had seen these Persian gardens were always in awe of them, and several Greek authors lovingly described these recreational areas as an example of the power of humans to beautify their surroundings.

We also find ancient theme parks in another sense: places that redefined themselves as tourist attractions and changed local traditions to suit foreign visitors. While Roman Athens mostly continued its old traditions (like the *ephebeia* and the Eleusinian mysteries) as before, but simply allowed distinguished foreigners to take part in them, Roman Sparta effectively became a parody of itself in order to suit foreign tourists. They had long had a prominent ritual in which young boys tested their courage and cunning by attempting to get past older boys with whips to steal cheeses from the altar of Artemis Orthia. In the Roman period, however, the ritual became steadily more brutal, to show the Roman tourists what Spartans were supposedly like; by the 1st century BC, the ritual simply involved boys being whipped until they passed out, trying to prove that they could take it without screaming. The Spartans deliberately built audience seats around the altar so the tourists could get a good view.

In short, there were many different kinds of thrill-seeking, entertainment and relaxation available to peoples like the ancient Greeks, but nothing specifically like our modern theme parks. Those looking for physical challenges would do sports, sail boats, or go to war. Of course, the ones that had a thirst for such things would mostly be rich men; the poor had plenty of back-breaking labour to fill their days with, and were happier to be entertained with a free meal and a show than with more hard work and potential danger."
948,AskHistorians,Why do depictions of humans in the middle ages look like child drawings when Greeks and Romans already knew how to draw (or sculp!) anatomically correct images?,/u/sunagainstgold and I answered a very similar question [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/d3u9uf/why_do_animals_in_medieval_manuscripts_look_so/).

949,AskHistorians,"Can we get an ""Unanswered"" tag?","One thing I want to highlight here as someone who regularly answers questions is that answering a question takes time. We usually get one popular thread per day (i.e. one that hits all with 1000+ upvotes) and from my experience, the gap between let's say 350 and 900 upvotes closes very quickly, in the matter of a couple of hours. Provided one user with expertise sees such a thread, it can take a couple of hours to research and write something up (if I am not intimately familiar with a topic but know where I can look it can take me 2-3 hours to write an extensive answer). In that time, a thread can hit all and have already a number of removed comments because people start jumping in with comments like ""Where is the answer?"", ""[removed]"", and ""The Jews are at fault"" (seriously, this happened twice in the last two days).

So basically by the time, a user with expertise has written an answer, a thread has already exploded and people are up in arms about removed comments. The interesting thing is that few of these threads ever go unanswered (I can think of only two in the last two weeks who didn't get an acceptable answer at some point), so usually it is only a matter of checking a couple of hours later to get an answer.

And as someone who answers questions, some of which get popular (Hitler!), rather frequently, such tags would only frustrate me, because an answer tag would probably lead to no one looking at an answer that comes late but that I have put a lot of work in while an unanswered tag would maybe save some people two clicks and three minutes of reading but also make the phenomenon of posts a la ""this has not been answered, so I'll give it a shot"" worse as well as it would not stop the posts complaining why this hasn't been answered yet when it is sitting at all with 900 upvotes."

951,AskHistorians,"In 256BC the Roman consul Regulus fought and killed a dragon, sending a 120' long skin back to Rome. What actually happened and how did Rome take his report of combat with a dragon?","In Latin, *serpens* and *draco* are frequently interchangeable. That's why Thomas Aquinas in the *Summa Theologica* can talk about humans commanding ""dragons""^1 (*dracones*)--he's referencing a saints' legend that is very clearly based on the staffs of Moses and the Pharaoh's magicians turning into *serpentes*.

So Greek δράκων, which can also mean generally ""serpent,"" is really not a leap that signifies any sort of ""dragon.""

This is pointed out clearly in the Stothers article that the other piece claims to cite.

Stothers' article itself is not great, though. Just for starters, his assertion that by the early Middle Ages, ""draco"" and ""serpens"" were separate is...not entirely true, as I pointed out above. 

Second, Stothers and the *Ancient History* piece both draw a distinction between ""historical"" and ""literary"" texts, which is...not really something modern historians would do. While there is of course a distinction between someone writing a historical chronicle and someone writing a ""fiction"" story, there is nothing ""non-literary"" about *historiae*. Those authors are using rhetoric and have their agendas just like 'fiction' authors.

Third, Stothers pretty much starts out with his conclusion--the accounts are true, the serpent is a python, and the size is probably exaggerated--and finds parallel mentions of too-large serpents in other ancient texts to support that conclusion. However, he's taking all of these out of their own literary and societal contexts.

And then he represents earlier scholarship disingenously when it disagrees with his point. For example, Stothers calls the work of Edward Bassett ""noncommittal"" on the matter. This assessment has...basically nothing to do with Bassett's actual argument. 

Bassett studies specifically the account by Silius Italicus in the *Punica*, one of the ones quoted and discussed in the clickbait article. And he spends about 20 pages demonstrating how Silius presents this episode as a loving, wildly educated elaboration of/reference to earlier stories and authorities--the Aeneid, other Virgilian texts, the labors of Hercules.

Bassett makes a pretty good case--I mean, he gets down to the level of individual words and phrases in showing how Silius draws from earlier sources. This is a common and beloved rhetorical device in ancient and medieval literature, not something to criticize.

But while in this case, Bassett's argument concerns the elaboration/polishing of one late, ""literary"" account of Regulus and his *serpens*, we can take the underlying lesson from it. The root story reminded Silius of earlier episodes--in particular, stresses Bassett, of Hercules.

**So within this tradition, there may well have been a large snake and a snakeskin in ""reality.""  But also (or instead of?), telling this story was a way of linking Regulus and his army to heroes of yore--a way to polish his, and Rome's, prestige and majesty in historical memory.**

Silius' heroicization of Regulus in his army's fight against the giant serpent finds reflection in modern scholarly discussion of Regulus as a historical/literary figure. Eleanor Leach and Rebecca Langlands, for example, are just two of the people who have highlighted Schrödinger's Regulus. In some ancient accounts, he is an exemplar of virtue; in others (especially Polybius), he is trash. 

Debates about the philosophy of exemplarity, as it were, are exactly as thrilling in comparison to DRAGON SLAYING as you think.^2 For present purposes, we can say that there were both positive and negative ideas about Regulus circulating in the Roman world. 

For writers who wanted to use their histories to establish Regulus in historical memory as a model, Regulus the SLAYER OF DRACONES makes him a hero through the feat itself and through the links to epic heroes--no matter how big, small, real, or imaginary the *draco* may have been.

952,AskHistorians,"Billy Graham was recorded as making extremely antisemitic comments to Nixon in 1972, but this tape was only released in 2002. What evidence existed of Graham's antisemitism before this? How common was this degree of antisemitism among Southern Evangelicals of his generation?","Rabid anti-Semitism grounded in paranoia about The Jews; political support for a Jewish state in Israel; and friends who are Jewish--none of these are surprising in the world of late 20th century evangelical Christianity. And the early 1970s, when Graham and Nixon had this conversation, is when they all came together.

I'm going to focus on conservative evangelicalism (hereinafter simply evangelicalism, but know there is a liberal tradition as well) more broadly. Partially because the story is bigger than the SBC and partially because Graham himself came out of a conservative Quaker tradition--Nixon as well, actually.


I discussed last week how opposition to the desegregation of public and then religious schools motivated evangelicals to political action in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This is true. But it's important to recognize that we're just talking about a call to *action* here--not the underlying readiness.

The political activation of evangelical Christians was so successful because the appeal of evangelical Christianity had been as much about politics as religion since the beginning of the century.

When you think about ""religion and politics"" in 1999, you probably think abortion; in 1969, civil rights; in 1919, temperance. But the politicized messaging that drew so many people to the evangelical fold over the 1910s-1960s was not so *overtly* social. Believe it or not, one of the driving forces of conversion to evangelical Christianity was anti-Communism.

This historiographical development has been *massively* influential in recent scholarship on evangelicalism. (It's even got a name--the ""Sunbelt thesis""). Different scholars obviously stress different elements. But in general, I think we can group arguments about the appeal of anti-socialism *as a religious belief* into two categories: money-based opposition to New Deal and similar policies, yes.

But just as important was xenophobia/nativism.  ""There is no room in America for any hyphen...We will not submit to any qualifying word before the word ‘American,"" declared popular preacher Charles Matthews on his 1924 Christian radio show.

Communism was one of those scary foreign things. And in the wake of the Russian Revolution, evangelical Christians--like so much of (especially white) America--were even more afraid of Communist *takeover* of America.

The thing about Christian anti-Communism? Even more so than secular, it was deeply and inherently anti-Semitic. ""Atheist Jewish Bolshevik"" was even somewhat of a catchphrase. It wasn't just an incidental association, either. It had to do with the end of the world.

Thanks to a labrynthine and very non-literal interpretation of handpicked Bible verses mashed together out of order, evangelical Christians at the turn of the 20th century believed they had a roadmap to Armageddon. And everywhere they looked (that is: contemporary popular culture), they saw a world so fallen into sin that God needed to bring to an end. 

One of the earliest stages of what they believed was how God would intervene for all eternity? World domination by foreign agents of evil.

Meanwhile.

In the late 19C/early 20C, Europe and America *levelled up* in anti-Semitism. Eastern European Christians feared of too-successful segregated Jews (thanks to Russian policy); Central European Christians feared of too-successful assimilated Jews (thanks to German  &c. policy). Paranoia of Rich Jewish Bankers taking financial control of the world, and Evil Jewish Leaders taking political control in order to kill Christians swept across Europe and America through texts like the *Protocols of the Elders of Zion.*

Evangelical Christians terrified of/excited for/terrified of the apocalypse saw in the bigoted fears of Jewish ""world domination"" what they feared/wanted/feared:  the fulfillment of eschatological prophecy. One English evangelical preacher said about the *Protocols*:

> “The *Protocols’* profound if unconscious knowledge of
prophecy makes any likelihood of their being a fake extremely remote.""

Evangelical scholar/preacher Arno Gaebelein agreed: the *Protocols* had surely been written by “a believer in the Word of God, in prophecy...a true Christian."" God had judged The Jews, once a chosen people, as ""the enemies of the truth of God and the enemies of the Cross of Christ.""

In early and midcentury evangelical radio preaching, fears of Jewish world domination and Communist world domination were conflated into, of course, those ""atheist Jewish Bolsheviks"" who were apparently Communist capitalist bankers.

Politicized anti-socalist theological teaching that was also anti-Semitic drew more and more people to evangelical Christianity during the early/mid-20C. Apocalyptic fears that were inherently anti-Semitic was a significant part of that teaching. Billy Graham was absolutely speaking out of long established conservative evangelical tradition.

In the early 1970s, in fact, evangelicalism was *doubling down* on that tradition.

Hal Lindsey took the credit for 1970's *The Late Great Planet Earth*, called the best-selling non-fiction book of the 1970s. It analyzed the ""signs of the times"" and argued that God was coming to punish and destroy the world (except real Christian believers, of course)...probably in the 1980s. It revitalized/publicized/evangelized/legitimized evangelical eschatology. 

Good old premillennial apocalypticism still had its plotline of world domination, and The Jews were still convenient scapegoats. In the *Left Behind* books, it's no accident that Jonathan ~~Boulderchick~~ Stonagal, the creatively-named bankroller of science and the Antichrist, is the religion that Rockefeller was *not*.

But also, as you note, the evangelical, premillennial apocalypse plot means that evangelical want to support *Zionism*--the theory holds that one of the steps towards the Battle of Armageddon is the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. (Notably: the current occupant of that site is the Dome of the Rock.) Evangelical support of Jewish people here is pragmatic, utilitarian, self-serving, and temporary.

It probably *did* help open the door to political collaboration between conservative Jews and conservative Christians on social issues in the 1970s, as a social-political agenda became more important to the new ""Religious Right."" But once again--we're talking cooperation because of mutual use.

And none of that overrides the paranoid stereotype that infused Graham's remarks to Nixon--bigotry against The Jews that, in 1970, was just as inherent to conservative evangelical Christianity as ever."

954,AskHistorians,"A very anti-government friend of mine keeps referencing citizens of the state of Idaho banding together to build paved roads without the government in the early 1900s. I cannot find anything to confirm this. Is this true, semi true, or is this completely fabricated?","A now-deleted comment asked if perhaps the person in question was thinking of private turnpike roads, such as the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike in Pennsylvania (which was the first major paved and macadamized road in the United States). 

If that is what the person is referring to, then they would be not quite right in thinking that such turnpikes were made by private individuals banding together without state involvement.

While turnpikes like the Lancaster turnpike were corporations that raised funds from investors, they were established with very active state government support. The route (and potential benefits) of the Lancaster turnpike were analyzed by a Select Committee from the state legislature in 1791, and the legislature passed a bill authorizing Pennsylvania's governor to establish a turnpike Corporation in 1792 (corporations at this time needed explicit legislation for their establishment). Supplemental legislation in 1795 even regulated the maximum width of the road allowable for the turnpike, and prohibited tolls from being collected on certain stretches for travelers going short distances on ""ordinary business"".

Nor was the president or managers of the turnpike purely private individuals: William Bingham was the corporation's first president, but was also Speaker of the US House of Representatives, and later a Pennsylvania Senator.

The corporation did raise capital for the project by selling stock to private individuals, and its initial sixty-two mile stretch cost $450,000 (an enormous sum for the time). But costs and progress of the turnpike's construction were regularly reported to the Pennsylvania legislature, and further regulation authorized methods of toll collection and specified how legal suits over toll collections would be pursued, and it what time frame.

I mostly point out these details for the Lancaster Turnpike not only for information on it but as an example of other such private turnpikes as existed at the time. There wasn't really a sense of a ""public"" sector separate from a ""private"" sector as we understand it today - these companies were something more like quasi-public corporations.

955,AskHistorians,How and why did the Alpine region come to be so wealthy despite mountainous regions often being 'backwaters'?,"As someone who grew up in the Alps I will try my best to answer this question.
Right at the start: Many of those ""powerhouses"" you describe only recently (in historic dimensions) became so. The bavarian Alps and the austrian Alps very long were anything but rich and economically powerful. They were among the poorest regions of Europe. A lot of this changed only during the 20th century and in the case of Bavaria for example even later, only late in the second half of the 20th century.

Another caveat: Many places you list aren't in the Alps per se, but rather in the regions that surround the Alps. Munich and Milan (BMW and FIAT respectively) are close to the mountains, but not in them, which makes a lot of difference. Big parts of Bavaria, which aren't close to Munich are also not very economically strong. It is mostly the area directly close to those big cities which is well off.


There are a couple of things however, that give all of those regions you mentioned economic advantages.


These are:

* being on important transit and trade routes.

* being idealized in the 19th and 20th century as holiday spots.

* a certain willingness to trade on both things equally, to the point of self-exploitation.


Historically, transit across the Alps was always important. The route Munich - Venice for example is centuries old and has always been very important. Roman roads to the bavarian provinces had to cross the alps. Modern roads follow those roman roads almost perfectly. It's the same for many other places in and around the alps. Crossing the alps was necessary to get to the rich italian cities on the adriatic and the mediterrenean coast. Venice and Genoa are the ones that immediately spring to mind.


Crossing the alps however was a daunting task for a long time, even all the way up to the middle of the 19th century. They had to be crossed on foot or by using carriages. This made travel across nigh impossible in winter and hard and ardous in spring, summer and fall. So life in one of the villages in the alps was very much the backwater-experience you would expect. Life was very hard and often dangerous since weather phenomena tend to be stronger in the mountains. Anyone who has experienced a thunderstorm while in the mountains knows what I'm talking about.


The soil in the mountains is also not suitable to farming. That's why farmers in the mountains tend to farm animals, not crops, even today. Heavy weather, poor soil - basically: Life in the mountains was always close to being unsustainable. People had to be inventive, and try to make money however possible. Woodcarving became a trade that was one way to earn money. Those long winters in the mountains gave you plenty of time to hone your carving skills and wood was in ample supply. There are records of bavarian woodcarvers carving altars in the 1500's and 1600's.
Most of this was by necesssity. Many people living in the alps were so poor they sent their children basically into slavery in the cities in Baden, Württemberg and parts of Bavaria. These so called ""Schwabenkinder"" existed all the way into the 20th century.


So that's the reality at the turn of the 19th to the 20th century for many of those spots, especially in the northern Alps. 


So what changed?

Trains, tunnels and roads.

As soon as crossing the alps become easier by way of modern technology, they turned from inaccessible regions to a knot on which trade through europe turned. 5 countries border on each other in this region. Three of those were large countries which had long established trade with each other: Germany, France and Italy. Switzerland sat right in between of them.
At the same time, at the turn from the 19th to the 20th century, the progressing industrialisation all over Europe turned the Alps into a bucolic vision of a simpler and better life.
The clearest example of this are the ""Heidi""-novels by Johanna Spyri, which portray life in the alps as wholesome, healthy and ideal, instead of the constant struggle against the elements and poverty it was in reality. The picture many people have of the swiss alps is still very much influenced by this version of the alps. Even people in Japan and Turkey have heard of Heidi and the life she lead in the mountains.
At the same time, other authors and artists followed this ""back to nature"" narrative and started to portray the Alps as a place where man could get properly in touch with nature and be humbled by the sheer size of the mountains and their majesty. Thomas Cook, the one of the travel company is one of those first tourists of the alps which told the world about them as a tourist destination.
Since the alps where ""multi-national""-no single country had a claim on all of the Alps- each country had it's own version. Austria and Switzerland always tried to market themselves as being the only country where you could experience the proper Alps, as opposed to for example Germany which only has mountains that reach barely 2900m in height. Yet every country you mention has a part of the Alps which it can call its own.
""Heidi"", ""The sound of music"" and a slew of german ""Heimat-""movies all very much portray this image of the alps as a different world, where you're supposed to be able to connect with nature in a way you wouldn't in many parts of ""flat Europe"".
Mountaineering was another side of this. Around the turn of the century, mountaineering was incredibly dangerous still, with equipment being much more prone to failure than today and the very real possibility of dying while climbing the summits of the alps. The ""Matterhorn"" wouldn't be as well known today if less people had died climbing it. To this day, each year at least one life is claimed by the mountain, which makes for a lot of mystery, adventure and good headlines. There is no bad PR. People want to see this mountain, which killed so many people, even if it is from a nice hotel on its feet.

So in summary:
The regions weren't all that rich to start with. The change in travel through technology made the alps very accessible, in my opinion more accessible than any other mountainrange you mention. Each country in and around the alps had a vested interest in turning those poor areas into something else, so they were keen to exploit the early tourism and went full steam ahead. The romantic idealization of the Alps through novels like ""Heidi"" or through the adventures of the mountaineers functioned as great PR for this tourism and it still works today.

It's a museum which collected whole farmhouses in the state they were left in, some very old ones. They regularly have great exhibitions on how people lived about a century ago or longer. They even offer workshops where you can try your own hand at old trades.

One personal aside:
If the current crisis shows anything, it's how fragile the wealth of those regions is. Without tourism, many of the villages and towns in the alps would be bankrupt very soon and poverty would follow very quickly.

EDIT: I suck at formatting and spelling apparently. Had to try multiple times to get it looking passable. Added a passage about Munich and Milan which are close to the Alpine regions, but not ""in"" the mountains, which makes a lot of difference."

957,AskHistorians,"After the use of Choctaw code talkers in WWI, Nazi Germany apparently sent spies, disguised as anthropologists and art students, to the US to learn Native American languages. However, they failed to learn Navajo. What do we know about this effort? How organized was it and who ran it on the Nazi end?","> I'm very curious about this - was this an organized effort by Nazi Germany? Was it started by Weimar Germany, as the 20-year timeline given in the letter seems to suggest?

This claim has been made by a multitude of contemporary sources, few of which seem to go into any significant depth beyond the nebulous ""Nazi Germany sent agents to the United States before the Second World War to attempt to learn various Native American languages."" I am curious about their sources. This effort by the Germans could have occurred, either as individual anthropologists or linguists, organized teams, or government consultation of enthralled German students who had chosen to study in the United States and then returned to Germany. There also, on the other side of the Atlantic, was fear of Nazi infiltration into United States institutions before and during World War II (stoked by the existence of the German-American Bund, the most prominent American pro-Nazi social organization of the mid to late 1930s), and the work of a few, albeit innocent, researchers or students could have been blown out of proportion by startled military intelligence officials.

I wonder, also, whether this fact (like others), has started to be repetitively pushed down the line without any serious ""re-research"" (i.e., finding the original source, and then analyzing the content and interpretation of the primary documents used) into its origins, and has lost subtle details.

The conclusion of Frank Usbeck's 2015 book *Fellow Tribesmen: The Image of Native Americans, National Identity, and Nazi Ideology in Germany*, seems to suggest that [this particular aspect of the Code Talkers' service (organized espionage campaigns by Weimar or, more particularly, Nazi Germany, against U.S. efforts to use Native American languages for military purposes), is not currently a well-researched area](https://imgur.com/a/Vd5d4qr).

**It is important, first, to understand the fact that the public in Weimar and Nazi Germany had a peculiar fascination with American ""Wild West"" and ""frontier"" culture and Native Americans, inspired by the works of German author Karl May.**

The populations of both Weimar and Nazi Germany had a fascination with Native American and ""Wild West"" culture and imagery, born out of the cultural effects of the works of German novelist and short story writer Karl May (1842-1912), who produced a large volume of writings. He first began working in the mid-1870s, after being released from prison and recanting on a life of crime, and continued until his death. He frequently wrote using pseudonyms. His first publications were ""travel stories,"" (accounts of his ""visits"" to other countries), but he later branched out into young adult and adult novels, often concerning the subjects for which he is most famous. He first began to gain notoriety in Germany in the 1890s.

May traveled to several places he had written about in his stories, including the United States, near the end of his life. He never actually visited the ""Wild West,"" however, and died the year Arizona and New Mexico were admitted to the Union, regarded by some historians as the death knell of this era. He was able to paint such a heavily romanticized picture of this period that it ""...has been so influential on several generations of German youth that *Der Spiegel* claimed recently that ""May has advanced to be a kind of *Praeceptor Germaniae* [""father of Germany""], whose influence, without doubt, is greater than that of any other German author between Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Thomas Mann."" Many of May's tales are described as ""cowboy and Indian"" works, but the ""cowboy"" characters in these works can be more properly described as *westmänner*, a German term used by May to mean ""frontiersmen"" or ""pioneers."" The main consistent figure in May's novels, ""Old Shatterhand,"" was:

> ...an American of German extraction, and a truly heroic Teutonic figure ""Siegfried in a coonskin cap."" Larger than life, Old Shatterhand was a powerful, blond, blue-eyed super man once described as a composite of ""Hopalong Cassidy, Ulysses, Christ, Siegfried, and Kaiser Wilhelm"" (Cracroft 1967: 257) who spoke 40 languages, including a fabricated Karl May dialect.

>  The vocabulary of this dialect used by Old Shatterhand and the *westmänner* was unlike any ever spoken in the West, a ""type of Teutonized Texan,"" although it is difficult to conceive a Texan exclaiming (at any time in history!) ""zounds,"" ""woe to me,"" ""'s death,"" or ""pshaw and damnation, sir!"" as Old Shatterhand was wont to do (Cracroft 1967: 254).

Old Shatterhand's companion was Winnetou, a ""remarkable"" Mescalero Apache chief. This relationship might have inspired the later stories of the Lone Ranger.

May had as an admirer the future leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler. As a boy, Hitler ""seemed to be infected with the stories of Karl May and the Redskins."" Hitler also (predictably) was fond of books on ""German culture heroes and those on heroism in war.""

> To Adolf the adventures of Old Shatterhand and his comrades were almost an obsession. He tirelessly led his schoolmates into violent re-enactments and when the enthusiasm of the older boys flagged he recruited younger ones and even, on occasion, girls (Toland 1976: 14).

> While the teacher was explaining new material, he read the books of Karl May...which he kept concealed under his desk. He would come to school with bowie knives, hatchets, and the like... (Langer 1972: 119).

Accounts of the relationships between May and Hitler as a child and in his later life appear only briefly in the works of many contemporary historians, and is only given a proper period treatment by Hitler's associate Albert Speer. The most telling aspects can be found in the writings of Hitler himself. He attached great significance to May's works, and said that they ""were a primary force in the development of his thinking.""

In 1943, the director of the Office of Strategic Services, William J. Donovan, enlisted a psychologist, Walter C. Langer, to compile a psychological analysis of Adolf Hitler. The influence of May's works on Hitler’s thinking was dismissed by Langer, as he considered them ""simply 'Indian and Wild West stories'"" and at the time, none of May's works had been translated into English and were only widely popular in Germany. In fact, Hitler continued to be a fan of May well into his rule of Germany. While being quoted as having said ""I never read a novel. That kind of reading annoys me,"" he evidently placed May's books in a separate category. Hitler had a complete set of his works in his personal library bound in fine calfskin, a gift from Hermann Göring. According to Göring, Hitler kept these books close at hand:

> They are much thumbed and read and usually one or two may be found in the small bedside bookcase with its green curtain in Hitler's bedroom (Oechsner 1942: 94-97).

In 1940, Klaus Mann, a German-born American writer and opponent of Adolf Hitler, postulated that May's works, through their influence on Hitler, were ""influenc[ing] the history of the world:""

> Being the militant incarnation of all good and noble principles, anything he did was necessarily good and noble: his cruelty was praised as heroism, his lack of morals interpreted as admirable ingenuity. The depraved, ambitious youth from Brunau was convinced that that was the way to bHe could see no reason why Old Shatterhand's convictions and tactics should not work if applied to national and international politics. One might conquer civilization by going back to the principles of the jungle...It hardly is an exaggeration to say that Karl May's childish and criminal fantasia has actually - though obliquely - influenced the history of the world.

From late antique (and earlier/later) medical authorities, we hear about Cyrenaic sap/root and silphium as ingredients in contraceptive/abortifacient recipes--presumed to be the same plant, since silphium was always noted to grow only in a small habitat range outside Cyrene. Modern scholars have concluded it was probably a variety of, or related to, fennel.

And yes, medical writers often note that it was extremely effective, and that it was extinct or almost extinct by the time Republic became Empire.

I think the thing to remember here, though, is how ridiculously rare and expensive silphium had to have been. If it really only grew inside a small radius around Cyrene and was impossible to cultivate (report some writers), I don't see how enough of it could possibly have grown and been picked to be accessible to the vast majority of women in ancient Rome who wanted it. And how can any medicine be effective if you can't use it?

* **[How did sex workers in brothels not get pregnant in medieval times?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4cpy2c/nsfw_how_did_prostitutes_in_brothels_non_get/d1kg6sj/)**

Surely some medieval sex workers, both those in brothels and those working on a temporary or contingency basis, did get pregnant. Court records from early 16C London, for example, might explicitly note that a woman initially sentenced to dunking in the Thames for sex work was ultimately spared ""being with child."" It also seems to be the case that brothel keepers may have helped new mothers dispose of their children.

Nevertheless, medieval medical authorities held that sex workers were infertile thanks to the extra dirt that built up in their wombs, which does suggest sex workers developed rough methods of contraception. We know some women specialized in providing abortifacient herbs. In one 16th century German case, a former sex worker, even, was known to supply other women with herbs to, in the circumlocution of the court records, restore their monthly menstruation.

Ruth Mazo Karras, one of the most important scholars on prostitution in the Middle Ages, suggested one other option that subsequent scholars have generally agreed with. John Rykener is a rare case of a cross-dressing man charged with prostitution. In his own court testimony, he reported that none of his (male) customers had any idea he was actually male. That suggests that sex workers had some sway with their clients in offering non-vaginal sex for sale. (ETA way later: I should add that P.J.P. Goldberg has argued that the case of John Rykener is a literary fabrication created for political ends).

Additionally, I need to mention one archaeological dig at Ashkelon in the Near East. This is a Roman bathhouse where the skeletons of many infants--born alive but dying shortly after birth--have been found in one of the drains. Archaeologists have posited that this bathhouse was the site of prostitution if not an outright brothel, and the dead infants were the victims of necessary infanticide. /u/kookingpot might be willing to say more about the dig and the various theories that have been proposed to explain the troubling evidence.

""Patchwork families.""

I love Ann-Cathrin Harders' term for it, and I should've thought to include it in my recent answer on [single mothers in medieval Europe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gm5ciz/what_happened_to_medieval_unwed_mothers/) One of the most important things it shows is: **contraception and infanticide were not the only option.**

With such messy and depressing mortality rates in the ancient and medieval world--and we're not just talking about death in childbirth here, which was less common than you probably think--even wealthy children had a strong chance of losing their father by mid-adolescence. A family which the father *possessed* was certainly the ideal, but it was by far not a given.

If we're talking about ""well-regarded"" sex workers, which I interpret as ""with more resources,"" I think **single mothers** is a good model to start with, especially regarding children once born. Roman sexual relationships were already more fluid than we might think of today, and children born out of wedlock were common enough to have a single word designating them in law: *spurii*. (Which, as the root of our ""spurious,"" does not have the best of connotations today.)

Women in the ancient and medieval worlds often cultivated a strong network of female family and friends. It was to them that single mothers tended to turn. Essentially adoptive mothers, stepmothers, aunts and uncles raising children--this was not the *norm*, but it was *normal*. 

Hence Harders' ""patchwork families,"" with the emphasis on *families*.

Would sex workers be treated any differently after giving birth to a child? ...Why would they?

**A second option was, indeed, abortion.** Many, *many* recipes for contraceptives and abortifacients are presented in classical medical texts--all the herbal combinations you could want. John Riddle, one of the major scholars working on birth control and abortion in ancient and medieval Europe, even suggests that some may have had at least a slight impact on the probability of preventing pregnancy or producing an abortion. 

Three problems, though: literacy, access to texts, and access to ingredients.

...On the other hand, contraceptives and abortifacients tend to be recipes--whether or not the same ones recorded exclusively by men--passed down or provided by other *women* as oral tradition.

**And then there is That Topic in scholarship**, the one where scholars go round and round in circles: infanticide.

As /u/kooking_pot discusses [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4cpy2c/nsfw_how_did_prostitutes_in_brothels_non_get/d1kg6sj/), archaeological evidence from Ashkelon can easily be interpreted as demonstrating a common practice of infanticide. Also not Pompeii, but in the Roman Empire (England), some scholars have suggested that a burial site containing the bodies of 97 babies demontrates systematic infanticide as well. Significantly for our purposes, the general assumption by these scholars is that the burial site/cemetery marks a brothel. Other scholars, Dominic Wilkinson points out, simply see a burial site for infants whose bodies were buried, not cremated.

There is plenty of strong evidence, however, to show that some women certainly left their children ""exposed""--but not necessarily in our view of the little baby on the mountaintop torn apart by wolves. Rome, at least, even had specific locations for parents or their delegates to leave babies they could not or would not raise--think of our Safe Spaces today, even. W.V. Harris points out that the intention was typically rescue, not death, if you consider that infants were often even clothed.

And in literature (which albeit is, well, literature), these babies are indeed often rescued.

**So, as an ancient Roman sex worker with some financial resources who found herself pregnant, a woman had real choices for her body, and perhaps later for her baby.**

959,AskHistorians,"What were the Tiananmen Square protesters demanding, and has this been portrayed honestly by Western media accounts?","While there were many causes for the discontent amongst students which eventually led to the Tiananmen Square protests, one of the main catalysts for the start of the protests would be the death of Hu Yaobang, and the demands of the student for the restoration of his legacy. I'll first explain who Hu was, and what eventually happened to him, before discussing the demands of the protesters.

Hu was a high-ranking communist party official that was appointed General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1981, making Hu the highest ranking official then. As part of the Deng clique, Hu was a supporter of economic and political reform within China, supporting more pragmatic policies in replacement of the previous Maoist ideologies. For example, Hu oversaw the purging of many corrupt/incompetent party members.

&#x200B;

While the Deng cliques reforms were initially successful, two primary issues plagued it. First, the different nature of a free-market economy. The new economic model led to rising inflation and slowing economic growth, and the ""Chinese people were not used to the ups and downs of a free-market economy"" (Kerns, 30). Secondly, government corruption. The nature of China's version of a free-market economy (they didn't implement the rules and regulations that ensured security and stability in the economy) meant that it was easier for government officials and business owners to exploit the system, making the system lend itself toward corruption. These two factors caused the people to begin demanding for more change.

&#x200B;

In 1986, student protests began in Anhui, China. The protests started in the city of Hefei, and were led by an astrophysics professor named Fang Lizhi. While the demonstrations had ostensibly begun as a result of the students feeling that the CCP ""was blocking free election campaigns in favour of their chosen candidate,"" (Kerns, 42) they quickly spreaded to other major urban centres such as Beijing and Shanghai, with students calling on the government to speed up the pace of reform. In general, the educated university students wanted more control over their lives, complaining about government regulations (such as mandatory physical exercise), or limited access to Western pop culture. The size of the demonstrations shocked the government; unlike during the Cultural Revolution, the government was determined not to lose control over the student groups.

&#x200B;

However, Hu hampered party efforts in this regard. He refused to criticize the student protesters, and was also criticized for not stopping the demonstrations before they spread. From Deng's perspective, ""Hu Yaobang was earning the goodwill of the intellectuals by being an overly permissive official who failed to enforce party discipline"" (Vogel, 635). On 1 January 1987, a People's Daily editorial attacked bourgeois principles and stressed the four cardinal principles, preparing the public for attacks on Hu Yaobang on both counts. On 2 January 1987, Hu formally submitted his resignation.

&#x200B;

Following his resignation, Deng organized multiple 'party life meetings,' which were essentially criticism sessions for Hu and his work. Over the next month, twenty to thirty top party officials criticized Hu on multiple counts ranging from spiritual pollution to meeting foreigners. Hu ""was completely unprepared for the force of the attacks...he later said that had he known the 'party life meetings' would take such a turn, he would not have submitted his resignation or engaged in such a thorough self-criticism"" (Vogel, 651).

&#x200B;

In short, it was ""the opinion of many liberal officials \[that it was\] a tragic injustice that Hu Yaobang, who had worked so hard for the country, who was so selfless, and whose policies could have worked, ended his service humiliated by people whom he had served with dedication"" (Vogel, 653).

&#x200B;

**Hu's Death and Memorial**

On 8 April 1989, Hu collapsed during a government meeting. He was taken to the hospital and treated for a massive heart attack. While it had initially seemed like he was recovering, he unfortunately passed away on 15 April 1989. His death came as a great shock to all - nobody had expected him to die. Hu's death ""attracted enormous sympathy, even among hardliners"" (Vogel, 665). Hu had long been a source of inspiration to the Chinese public for his integrity, dedication, and personal warmth. Furthermore, he had been supportive of the youth and the intellectuals during the student demonstrations of 1986, making him a symbol of hope for reformists. However, he had been forced to submit humiliating self-criticisms and was removed from office in 1987. Ezra Vogel argues that ""like Zhou Enlai, Hu Yaobang had fought to protect the people and had died a tragic death. In both 1976 and 1989, the public was outraged that a man whom they revered had not been treated with more respect"" (Vogel, 667).

&#x200B;

Therefore, the demonstrations of April 1989 were made to mourn the death of Hu Yaobang. However, Vogel also notes that ""many of those who took part in the demonstrations were not concerned about Hu Yaobang personally; instead, they regarded him as a useful rallying point for expanding their efforts to increase freedom and democracy"" (Vogel, 667). Thus, to answer a claim in your question, it would be inaccurate to say that the student protesters were calling for the abandonment of the push for economic liberalization."
960,AskHistorians,Did any of the ancient civilizations know they were one of the first human civilizations or have any understanding of the significance of that?,"This is an answer I gave to a similar question a few years ago.

So I'm only gonna be talking about the Sumerians here. The only way that we are going to have any knowledge of what the first civilizations knew of their past is through written records. Writing first appears in Sumer in around 3000 BC, this is during the Uruk period (4000-3001 BC). At this time it was very much proto-writing and did not develop into a full written language until the Early Dynastic Period (2800-2500 BC)

It is not until the end of the Early Dynastic Period (2300 BC) that we see the emergence of the Sumerian King List which documents the kings of Sumer and gives us an insight into what the Sumerians may have believed about their past.

The King List, a collection of several sources, details the rulers of the cities of Sumer from the first antediluvian rulers to the last dynasty of Isin. The first king was Alulim, first king of Eridu. He ruled for 28,800 years. Now at first glance that may seem an unreasonably long rule and that is because it is. Alulim, the first king after the kingship descended from heaven created by the god Enki is clearly almost entirely mythical. This list of antediluvian kings ends with Ubara-tutu and the coming of the great flood that wipes the world clean.

The list resumes with Jushur the first of the dynasty of Kish. He ruled for 1200 years. 20 kings and 15255 years later we have En-me-barage-si who is the first king we have archaeological evidence for. He is dated from around 2600 BC from two pieces of alabaster vases found at Nippur which bear his name. Though he ruled for 900 years, a rather long time, it can be surmised that he is indeed real. He is mentioned also in the Epic of Gilgamesh alongside Gilgamesh himself giving credence to the thought that Gilgamesh is a historical figure. The King List continues into the time of rulers that can easily be verified such as Sargon of Akkad who ruled for 40 years and founded the Akkadian Empire. Thus we see the transition of the mythical into the semi-mythical and then verifiable history. But more on that later.

The Sumerian creation myth is important to note in this discussion. It recounts that the gods Enki among them created the first “black-headed people” (the Sumerians) and settled them in the land giving them the kingship and thus the first cities were created. A large part of the story is missing but at some point the gods decide not to save mankind from a flood which strikes destroying man and cites. Later the world is presumably repopulated.

In addition there is the “Debate between Summer and Winter” a creation myth from the mid 3nd millennium. This details the creation of the land and seasons by Enlil. In it he is seen to irrigate the land “guaranteeing the spring floods at the quay” and to begin the agricultural tradition of the land “making flax grow and barley proliferate.”

Finally and most interestingly for this topic is the “Debate between Sheep and Grain” another creation myth written in the mid-3rd millennium . The myth details a time in which sheep and grain were unknown to the land. The people “went about with naked limbs in the Land. Like sheep they ate grass with their mouths and drank water from the ditches.” The myth ends with the virtues of grain being extolled “from sunrise to sunset may the name of Grain be praised. People should submit to the yoke of grain.”

Therefore we can see that early history of Mesopotamia, the Ubaid period and before, is in Sumerian text seen in a divine light. The land was created by the gods as were the people and they were given cities and kingship. Enlil gave the people the summer and the winter, he gave them wheat and irrigation as Enki gave them kingship. Only in the “Debate between Sheep and Grain” is there indicated any knowledge of a time before sedentary agriculture. This myth clashes with that of the “Debate between Summer and Winter” though it is part of the same tradition indicating the lack of a unified view of their past. It seems that the Sumerians saw their past as part of a very real mythical tradition. Their kings begin as mythical figures and progress towards the non-mythical. The mythical and the non-mythical are closely linked in the Sumerian view of themselves and their past

I would conclude that the Sumerians did believe themselves to be not just the first civilization but the first people, it is part of their creation myth. In addition there was no knowledge in the way we would think of a hunter-gatherer life preceding their urban civilization. If there is any hint it exists as another facet of the extensive and contradictory creation myth of the peoples of Sumer.

961,AskHistorians,"I am a medieval peasant boys in my teenage years and I start feeling attracted to other boys/men. What, if any, is my perception of homosexuality and how could I deal with it?","I have an [earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/dw27v9/what_are_the_historical_origins_of_homophobia/f7gl4ne/) that might interest you:

* **I'm a peasant in 13th century England, and another villager catches me and my male friend having ""relations"". How likely is it we'll be executed for sodomy (or anything else)?**

The original question asked about men; I talked about women as well!

~~

None. At all.

Scholars have long recognized the twelfth century as a pivotal moment in the intellectual history of sodomy in the west (and of pretty much everything, to be fair). Although there are scattered references to ""sex as the sodomites do""--which is to say, anal intercourse regardless of the sex/gender of people involved--as definitely a sin and a very bad thing in earlier medieval sources, it's really in the 12th century that theologians and the new specialty of canon lawyers make it a particular point of focus and bitter opprobrium.

However, into the early 13th century, the primary target of this zeal was *clergy.* Accusations of heresy and sodomy went hand-in-hand in the Languedoc in the run-up to the Albigensian Crusade (against the people the Church deemed Cathars). Lateran III (Church council) in 1179 targeted clergy who violate clerical celibacy with either marriage *or* the ""sin against nature"": sodomy, since anal intercourse can never lead to reproduction. 

Church councils in France in 1212 and 1214 also impressed the evils of sodomy among the clergy. The only time laymen were mentioned among these was in 1179, and even then, the recommendation was excommunication.

But the 13th century was its own turning point in the intertwined history of religion and sexuality. The Church had quite successfully used control over marriage practices (such as through laws on consanguinity) as a spearhead in entrenching itself as a power player in profane society. At Lateran IV in 1215 and with the introduction of new orders of preachers (especially the Franciscans and Dominicans), the Church committed itself to shepherding workaday laity more closely through life and to salvation, including through religious instruction and moral discipline. The diffusion of actual *practice* out of the ideal, including the most important points of ""every Christian of both sexes"" must confess their sins once a year to their parish priest and then receive the Eucharist at Easter, took time to filter downwards. 

But pastoral theologians were *enormously* concerned with regulating sexual practices. Handbooks for confessors, arranged according to the seven deadly vices, devote vastly more space to sins under the umbrella of *luxuria* than the other six (although *ira*, wrath, gets a fair amount of play). 

And intriguingly, some of the *summa confessorum* authors had a particular emphasis on sodomy. Far from the times of Aelred of Rievaulx not even daring to mention the sin directly for fear of accidentally corrupting the mind of someone who'd never thought of non-PIV sex, Paul of Hungary's *summa* spends roughly **100 times** as much space on sodomy as on other sins of lust.

But it's noteworthy that Paul is still an extreme example at this stage. And just like scholars assume annual participation in confession and the Eucharist was hardly universal immediately in 1215, actual attempts to control lay sexuality beyond basic issues involving marriage in both canon and civic courts were very slow in coming.

Italy led the way. In 1250, Bologna decreed that the punishment for sodomy was exile, but the banished could petition for permission to return. In 1259, the city rescinded the possibility of forgiveness. Only in 1288 was sodomy declared a crime deserving execution. Contemporary German law codes were still ignoring sodomy as a crime. 

In France, meanwhile, sodomy was apparently a possible crime by 1270. However, there were no prosecutions, convictions, or executions until the reign of Philip V (1316-1322; note that I am not counting the Templars here, since the sodomy accusations there were sort of an ""...and the kitchen sink"" kind of deal), during which there was a whopping...one.

One addition I do want to make this time. It's kind of a truism that sodomy, homosexuality, homophobia and so forth were in practice limited to men. This is not entirely true. In the Middle Ages, there are some in-retrospect-hilarious examples of texts like the *Ancrenne Wisse*, an early 13th century guide to religious life for women. 

As Jane Bliss (real name) points out, the text contains a number of oblique references to both masturbation and lesbian sex (""it was with...an innocent creature"" ""a woman such as myself"") as sins. But, as with Aelred, the author cannot/does not want to say anything explicitly for fear of putting ideas into women's heads.

I'm sure we all know exactly what to think about *that*.

But while the *Ancrenne Wisse* became a devotional text for women to study, the broader social and legal consequences for same-sex sex also turned against women. Helmut Puff has published a few times on the case of Katharina Hetzendorfer in 1477 Speyer. She was convicted and executed, in the manner typically used on women, for engaging in sex with women ""like a man,"" using a dildo. 

It's nobody's place to speculate on gender identities or even what that would mean in the Middle Ages (a topic of much scholarly discussion right now). But it shows first of all the roots of this strand of homophobia, at least, in gender-lines transgression. It also shows that Hetzendorfer here was seen as a woman having sex with other women.

But as an additional layer of interest: there was apparently no *name* for this crime, under the law. But she was still drowned for it.

England, meanwhile? England appears to have been the least concerned with sodomy as a whole during the High Middle Ages. Not only was sodomy not on the law books in the 13th century, but even during the 15th and 16th centuries when convicted sodomites (mostly men, but a handful of women as well) were burned to death with some regularity in many countries (especially Italy)--executions in England for the sin against nature were surprisingly rare.

We have *no* surviving peasant voices from the Middle Ages, so we cannot reconstruct the *fama* (or infamy, in this case) associated with sodomy in 13th century English villages. This makes it difficult to talk about potential social consequences on the daily life level. However, from an official standpoint, execution at this time was not an option.

This will make the rumors about Edward II all the more interesting and the evidence all the more ambiguous. The existence of slander against someone through accusations of same-sex sex suggests less about the people involved, and much more about the culture that considers it a damning insult."
962,AskHistorians,"Why did the Indian Subcontinent never have countries with strong seafaring traditions, even though they had a vast peninsula, unlike European countries?","I was hoping an expert on the subject would come in, but as none are forthcoming I would like to point out that this is actually a misconception, or more accurately, there is actually an exception to the unassuming historical maritime prowess of the kingdoms that used to exist in the Indian subcontinent. This exception is the naval invasions of South-East Asia by the Chola Empire.

The Cholas ruled over what is now South and South-East India. They were a supposedly ancient dynasty but there is little written evidence on the Cholas prior to the 7th century CE let alone their origins. However, we do have a number of sources on what is now called the ""Medieval Cholas"" or ""Imperial Cholas"". This began in c. 848 CE when Vijayalaya captured Thanjavur and later defeated the neighbouring Pandyas and Pallavas. The Cholas slowly grew their influence and power in the region but it was under Rajaraja I and his son Rajendra I that they became the dominant power in Southern India and projected their influence even across the Bay of Bengal.

Rajendra I or Rajendra Chola I became the ruler in 1014 CE. It can be said that his father, Rajaraja I, laid the foundations of a great maritime power by building a strong naval force and had captured the Maldives and the northern parts of Sri Lanka. This was made possible by commissioning various foreigners (prominently, the Arabs and Chinese) in the naval building program. These effort were continued and the benefits were reaped by his successor, Rajendra who continued his father's naval conquest of the whole of Sri Lanka in 1017. However, it was the conquest of Srivijaya - a kingdom in South-East Asia that would mark the greatest naval achievement of not only the Chola dynasty but all of the subcontinent. 

Srivijaya was a thriving empire that controlled much of the Malay archipelago. They maintained a powerful navy which enabled them to control the region's maritime trade routes through the Straits of Malacca and that of Sunda. There are varying accounts of what caused Rajendra I to embark on his South-East Asian campaign but a plausible motivation is control of this lucrative trade route especially to China. The menace of piracy and the threat posed by it especially on the horse trade (on which the Chola Empire depended) was also another possible contributing factor. There are also those that suggest that the causes lie in the relationship between the Chola Empire and the Khmer Kingdom. The Khmer king Suryavarman I is said to have requested help from Rajendra I in his conflict with the Tambralinga Kingdom. This in return resulted in the Tambralingas approaching Srivijayan king Sangrama Vijayatungavarman for his support – triggering a conflict between the Cholas and Srivijaya.

Whatever the cause, in 1025 CE, the Chola navy embarked on their momentous naval campaign. Instead of entering the Strait of Malacca where Srivijayan naval forces were deployed, they sailed southwards along Sumatra’s west coast and entered through the Sunda Strait thus catching the Srivijayan forces completely by surprise. The Chola navy laid siege first on the capital city of Palembang, capturing it and plundering the Kadatuan royal palace. In the attack, Rajendra Chola is said to have captured and imprisoned King Sangrama Vijayatungavarman along with huge plunder. The Chola fleet then utilised the South-East Asian monsoon to their benefit – launching attacks on other Srivijayan ports, moving from one port to another swiftly thus, never really allowing the Srivijayan navy to launch an effective counter. By the end of the war, Rajendra had scored a decisive victory over Srivijaya and extended his supremacy over modern day Malaysia, the Andaman and Nicobar isles and southern Thailand. His dominance over the seas also allowed him to extract tributes from the rest of Siam and the Khmer kingdom. A second invasion was led by Virarajendra Chola, who conquered Kedah in the late 11th century.

The evolution of the Chola navy to become a true blue-water navy was a striking feature which was never matched again in the subcontinent's history. Though the invasions did not result in permanent occupation of the archipelago they did weaken the Srivijayan supremacy in the region and was one of the contributing factors to their eventual downfall. 

*An addition I would like to add (which is related to this question, especially if you are Indian and, thus, the reason for posting this very question) is there is a tendency in Indian media and to some extent in Indian school curriculum to portray India (and the kingdoms that used to make up the subcontinent) as having never invaded neighbouring kingdoms/countries in its entire history, which is not true. The naval expeditions of the Cholas is an instance proving this wrong. There are also the methods that independent India employed to incorporate many of the princely states after 1947 to name a few (albeit very few). Anyway, this is a different topic that merits a separate explanation but suffice to say nationalism and patriotism have been a major force in shaping this historical narrative.*

963,AskHistorians,"In Jarhead, a marine trainee in the scout sniper program stands up during a crawling exercise and gets shot. How common were such training exercise deaths from live ammunition at the time?","We have sufficient data, thanks to the Recruit Mortality Registry started in 1977, to give a fairly definitive answer as to how many recruits died on the obstacle course from gunfire in the time period from 1977-2001 across all the armed forces: one.

I'll explain the circumstances of what happened (it wasn't from standing up) but first, the general statistics: there were 276 deaths overall, with 77 being considered ""traumatic"": suicide, injury, or homicide. Recruits were under close supervision and lacked access to motor vehicles, so the main accident-killer amongst the armed forces (vehicle accidents) was not represented. Of ""unintentional injuries"" the categories given were overdose, fall, explosion, gunshot, electrocution, asphyxiation, close combat.

(Incidentally, there was likely a bit of undercounting, but that is because heart attacks and other physical ailments were sometimes categorized as ""natural deaths"". A 1994 [GAO Report](https://www.gao.gov/products/nsiad-94-82) led to ""training-related"" deaths being more inclusive of physical problems that should have been caught before putting recruits under stressor that set them off.)

For example, under ""falls"" a 19 year old died by falling off the top bunk ""while sleeping"" and
striking his head on the concrete floor; an 18 year old died on a physical training course:

>Descending from the top of obstacle, lost footing on the fourth rung from the top, fell 25 feet, and struck the incline ladder at the base

In close combat, the two deaths involved Marines who were boxing in a combat training area, including one whose death was described as:

>Injured by a blow, inhaled an ammonia capsule, began swinging wildly, restrained by the referee, and then lost consciousness

The five gunshot wound fatalities were mostly from poor gun handling, including an 18 year old
who bent forward to pick up his ""data book"" and hit the trigger of his M-16 with his thumb.

This is reinforced in an Army guide which goes into detail about training that happened in 1990 in August -- that is, roughly the time of Jarhead. There were no fatalities or even injuries, but they found ""muzzle orientation"" in particular to be poor, that is, the recruits were often unaware of the direction their weapons were pointing, and there were ""several accidental discharges"" and recruits often forgot to check if their weapons were safe. (In response, the guide notes that ""in future exercises, individuals will be pulled and reported to the brigade
chain of command."")

The obstacle course gunshot fatality -- Pvt. Dericcio White, 21, of Flint, Mich. -- happened in 1994 at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, during a night training exercise on a ""squad-platoon offensive tactics course"". Recruits carried M-16s and crawled under barbed wire and live fire from an M-60 machine gun.

The machine gun was set to fire ""about 8 feet high"" with safety mechanisms to prevent it from firing downwards. During the exercise, the gun jammed, and while the sergeant tried to clear the jam, he took it off its mount and it fired.

This is what killed the Private. It was not, in any sense at all, the recruit's fault, and the army recommended future training sessions include a second M-60 to be used if the first one fails rather than trying to fix the gun mid-training.

964,AskHistorians,"According to Ken Burns, the average soldier in the Civil War was 5'8 and 140 pounds, which seems exceptionally small and light for a population selected to fight; would this have been consistent with European armies of the same time period? If not, what would explain the differences?","In fact, Americans in the 1860s tended to be unusually tall, and that included soldiers. [One study](https://ourworldindata.org/human-height) found the average American soldier in 1860 was 5'7"" tall (170.6 cm). That's an inch or two taller than major European countries — the British and Dutch averaged around 5 feet and 5.5 inches; the French were shorter still. 

[Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK235960/table/ttt00002/?report=objectonly) looking solely at American soldiers similarly found the average male soldier in 1864 was just over 5'7"" tall; the average soldier in World War II was 5'8.4"" tall, just over an inch higher. 

Studies looking at 19th Century male height almost exclusively look at soldiers, because that was often the only consistent way of collecting data. But these data should be looked at carefully — because European armies, at least, usually had minimum height requirements for soldiers, and surprisingly large numbers of European conscripts flunked that test. 

Looking at France, my specialty, in the 1820s ""about a quarter of boys liable for conscription were refused as being below the minimum height to handle a musket (only just over 5 feet),"" per historian Robert Tombs. The shortest, most malnourished soldiers came not from the teeming large cities but from the poorest rural areas. Eugen Weber gives some specific examples from the department of Lot in southwestern France; in one district, the 1830 draft class consisted of 1,051 draftees, of which 212 (one-fifth) were rejected. Of those, the cited reason was stuntedness (*défaut de taille*) for 120. Consistently, Weber notes, up to half of all people rejected for military service were rejected for shortness. (Many of the others had various physical deformities or ailments, which are also associated with malnourishment. ""In 1860 one rural area near Grenoble had this to show to the army recruiters: goiter, 140; deaf or dumb, 13; lame, 13; myopia, 36; tapeworm, 19; scabies, 1; skin maladies, 86; scrofula, 15; epilepsy, 2; general weakness, 197; hunchback, 29; bone distortion, 2. In a total of 1,000, 553 men were disqualified, only 447 found fit for service."") 

Alain Corbin's case study of a 19th Century French peasant (born 1798, died 1876) notes that he was 5'5"" tall and that ""for this time and place, in other words, he was a tall man."" 

One 1849 discussion of ""men remarkable by their height"" to serve in elite French units ""makes clear that they are between 5'6"" and 5'8"" tall,"" Weber writes. These elite, unusually tall French soldiers would have been average or even short in the Union Army!

By 1860, the situation in France had improved somewhat — Emile Durkheim found ""the number of conscripts rejected for height dropped from 92.8 per 1,000 in 1831 to 59.4 per 1,000 in 1860,"" but that's still more than 1 in 20 men being less than around 5' tall. [Today](https://tall.life/height-percentile-calculator-age-country/) 1 in 297 adult Frenchmen would fail that test. (This reflects improvements in agriculture and transportation during the 1850s.) Even the soldiers who were healthy enough to be admitted into the army often required ""a few months of solid regular feeding, including 340 grams of meat a day, before they could cope with the physical demands of service.""

Unlike in Europe, the Union Army didn't have codified height minimums, but rather a subjective judgment by an examining doctor. One American officer summarized the situation in 1875: 

> Weight is not a regulated quality in any code of laws governing the enlistment of recruits. The circumference of chest thought to be indispensable as an accompaniment to certain degrees of stature, is carefully laid down in the English regulations, but weight is not even mentioned. It is presumed that the matter is left to the discretion of the examining surgeon, with whom the decision as to the other qualities named might, it is thought, be also left with advantage. A due proportion in the weight is quite as essential in the soldier as a well-formed chest, and is of greater importance than lofty stature. In former times, when it was necessary to make use of a ramrod in loading a musket, men of a certain height were absolutely necessary for the service; but in these days of breech-loading arms, a man from 5 feet to 5 feet 4 inches in stature, and well proportioned in build and weight is, ceteris paribus, as serviceable a soldier as can be desired.

Americans were shorter then than they are now, but if you're comparing them to other Western countries, Union soldiers were remarkable not for being short but for being tall.

EDIT: I've seen nearly half a dozen replies now asking questions about my use of inches and feet. To preempt more: Those are standard, modern inches and feet. In most cases the raw height data was given in centimeters and I translated it into modern feet and inches because the question was asked using those units. No, the differences here are not explained by the confusion about different units called the ""foot"" that is commonly cited as a reason for the (largely false) belief in Napoleon's shortness.

965,AskHistorians,Why was my Grandfather in Malaya in the 1950s and why is he the only person I’ve ever heard talk about the war there?,"I’m not an expert on The Emergency specifically but have been conducting research on Malayan/Malaysian independence at the same time and I can tell you that one reason you haven’t heard much about it is that many of the records are still sealed. I have looked for and tried to request documents relating to The Emergency from the National Archives at Kew Gardens, but they are still classified (and it should be noted that this is contrast to most of the British gov’t documents dealing with Malaya around the time of independence which have been declassified in the last 10-15 year’s). Information about the Borneo campaign is even sparser in my experience. In touching on British campaigns in Malaya I believe you have hit on a section of 20th-century history which is genuinely lacking in academic and primary source material. However, I can help respond to some of your questions, especially centering on political issues and independence. 

The 5-second summary of The Emergency is that it was a consequence of economic and political disruption caused by the Japanese takeover of Malaya. The Emergency was fought against the military arm of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP), so while in a sense it was a jungle war against independence-minded Communist guerillas like Vietnam, it was never anywhere near the quagmire of Vietnam. Why? Most simply because the MCP and its fighting forces did not enjoy popular support or foreign backing at the same level as Vietnam. The central issue of Malayan (and eventually Malaysian) independence was ethnic and/or racial division. Ethnically bumiputra or Malay people  (basically the native inhabitants) composed one major group and wealthier Chinese immigrants the other (with Indians composing a significant but not quite equivalent third). The MCP was mostly dominated by radical Chinese Communist revolutionaries. Obviously, they were not supported by Malay or Indian people and there was a more popular and legal political party called the Malayan Chinese Association which was a part of a governing coalition of uni-ethnic parties (and still exists today). To repeat the main point there, Malaya was an ethnically fractionalized place and so The Emergency never really took off beyond Communist radicals hiding in the jungle because it failed to appeal to the broader Malayan public (and many of its tactics, like assassinating the British High Commissioner, didn't help).

I’m not sure what your comment about Wikipedia and offers for independence being rejected is exactly alluding to,  but the British were actually fairly prompt about releasing Malaya as a colony after WWII. Malaya gained serious semi-autonomous powers in 1948 and after constitutional conferences and deliberation between 1955 and 1957, the Federation of Malaya gained independence in 1957 (although maintained a special military relationship with Britain for a time after independence, partially because of the ongoing Emergency).

Last, I’ll try to respond a bit more to why there is not more “outrage” and why it is perhaps a “lost war.” One reason there isn’t as much outrage is that your characterization of The Emergency as an invasion is not correct. British military forces were operating within their own legal dominion, not invading a sovereign state. That said, there are British plans in case things spiraled out of control and they needed to invade Indonesia and nearby areas which you can read at the National Archives. The Independent articles you linked mentions the Borneo campaign which was dealing with Indonesia and is mostly a different conflict, and when that Independent article you cited says that we really don’t know a whole lot about what happened in Borneo in the mid 1960s they aren’t wrong or kidding, and that’s why I have mostly left it alone in this reply. But back to The Emergency, which was not fought on the scale of Vietnam or against the local population to the same degree Vietnam (or at least the invasion of North Vietnam) was. This is also partly speculation, but I think the reason such a war is not popular in school curricula or the media is that Great Britain fought a lot of colonial wars, The Emergency is just not as outstanding as some of the others (or the lack of declassified documents is having a bigger effect on coverage than I think).

I fear that was all a bit slapdash, jargon-filled, and disjointed; I can (and have) filled dozens of pages about this stuff and so I am happy to answer follow-ups or PMs. Most of my post and claims (other than where I labeled explicit opinion) I can cite to documents at the National Archives, which I’m happy to lead anyone to if you ask. I'll also recommend some other things and resources on this topic which might be of interest to you. First, I am not sure if it still there but when I was last at the Imperial War Museum London about a year ago there was an exhibit covering British spec ops and it had some fascinating stuff on British operations during The Emergency. Second, Britain was also involved in (and to what degree is highly contentious) the Indonesian mass-killings of 1965-66. Whereas rising Communism in Malaysia during The Emergency (especially among the ethnically Chinese) was dealt with by military engagement, usually out of public sight and with spec ops and British army, in Indonesia anywhere from 500,000 to >1,000,000 (the highest estimates cross 2 million) were simply massacred in the streets and fields for allegedly having ties to the Communist Party. Former American CIA officers and diplomats have come forward about the American role in it all, and two Oscar-nominated documentaries, The Act of Killing and The Look of Silence, tell the story (and its impact on modern-day Indonesia) in incredible and shocking detail. Last, if anyone is interested in this period of Malaysian history or maybe all of it and want to dip your toes in the water you can either read the relevant section or all of Jim Baker’s Crossroads: A Popular History of Malaysia and Singapore, it's a good introduction.

966,AskHistorians,"During and shortly after the construction of the pyramids, what did the average citizens of ancient Egypt think about them? Were they proud to have such constructions or did they view them as a waste of resources and labour?","In an important sense, I'm afraid, this question is simply unanswerable. The written resources that we have for such a remote period of history are very scant, and those that do exist are pretty much entirely focused on elites and religious affairs. The evidence that archaeology offers for material culture is predominantly symbolic in nature and extremely difficult to interpret.

We can see some things through this murk, however. Kemp's *Ancient Egypt* (which is among the most respected works that attempt to deal with the Egyptian culture of this period more generally, rather than focusing entirely on those elites) paints a picture of a complex, vibrant and adaptable civilisation that had little in common with the staid, static and fundamentally conservative society that most of us imagine. It's important be realistic, however. When it comes to understanding how these ancient people thought, and what was important to them, even Kemp is reduced to generalities – he takes quite a bit of time to explain that Egyptian villagers valued the security that agricultural surpluses brought, seeing this as the seed from which the Old Kingdom state eventually grew, for instance – or to attempts to use 20th century game theory to explain the emergence of early dynastic Egypt.

Really the most we can reasonably say now, looking back, is that the peoples of the Old Kingdom clearly did place significant store in symbolism and iconography. The pyramids were only one product of what was a religious more than it was a political state; statuary and surviving palace facades also offer clues in this respect, and what emerges is a partial record of a world in which the pharaoh's prime duty was to impose order on what would otherwise be universal chaos. In this sense they were not merely kings, but priest-kings, whose actions were crucial to ensuring that vitally important things such as the annual Nile floods took place. This was not simply the duty of a lifetime, but – for a deified king – of an eternity, and so  the pyramids were not monuments to a life lived on earth, but rather palaces that would continue to be resided in by pharaohs after they were dead.

Lehner and Hawass offer a good summary of our current understanding of what all this meant for ""average Egyptians"":

>In searching for the meaning of the pyramid\[s\] for the ancient Egyptians, we could do no better than look at the rituals they conducted in the pyramid complex every day, long after the royal funeral had taken place. The Abusir Papyri are a textual window into these daily services ...\[that\]... suggest that the daily ritual reflected both the funerary aspect and its function as a residence for the deified king.

The rituals were principally designed, it seems, to protect and nourish the royal spirit that dwelled within the pyramid. But the dead and deified pharaoh had a reciprocal duty to protect the people making the offerings. Ancient Egyptian society can perhaps best be envisaged as comprised of a nested series of ""households"", the heads of which had a duty of care to the other members of the same household; pharaohs, thus, had a duty of care to the entire Egyptian people, even (indeed, especially) after they themselves were dead. In this sense, Lehner and Hawass conclude, ""offering to the pharaoh in his temples was offering to the wider community.""

Insofar as we can reconstruct the feelings and opinions of ""the average citizens of ancient Egypt"" at all, then, it is probably safe to assume that they viewed the structures built during this period not as secular monuments to kings and states that its ""citizens"" (really ""subjects"" is a better word here) might take ""pride"" in, but as significant pieces of a prophylactic religion that incorporated ceremonial and spiritual elements that were much more important than the structures themselves. It would have been impossible for anyone brought up in this religious environment, and believing in it, to see the resources devoted to pyramid construction as in any sense a ""waste"".

For the ancient Egyptians, pyramids were, in short, a central feature of royal cults whose continued existence was very important to the efforts made by the state as a whole – hence, by its subjects – to managing the local environment and ensuring it remained able to support them all. Perhaps thinking of things in this way helps us to see the parallels and the connections that link us to this distant past, rather than just the vast and startling differences that separate us from it.

967,AskHistorians,"How can Ragnar Lodbroks children be considered real historical figures, but Ragnar himself is still considered to be mostly fictitious?","The ""Ragnarssons,"" particularly Ivarr *beinlausi,* Halfdanr (possibly bynamed Hvitserkr), and Bjorn Ironside (but probably less Sigurðr snake-in-the-eye - he's mentioned exactly once in a non-Norse source) are considered to be historical figures due to their presence in records from outside of Scandinavia. Ivarr is attested in Early English and Irish annals (usually as Yngvar, an older form of the name), Halfdanr is attested in annals and in charter evidence from Northumbria, Bjorn Ironside is found in Frankish and Galician annals, and the voyage he led into the Mediterranean alongside Hásteinn is attested in Islamic sources. With such a wide-ranging set of sources, it's hard to deny that these leaders are historical. They seem to have referred to themselves as brothers, some (but not all) English sources refer to them, particularly Ivarr and Halfdanr, as such.

Sigurðr Ormr-i-auga is the edge case. If he was real, he was ruler of some part of Denmark in the 870s. The problem is, we have no sources from Denmark in the 870s - the first one we get is Saxo Grammaticus' *Gesta Danorum* from around 1200. By that time, the legend is solidly in place, as is Sigurðr's almost-miraculous childhood. According to the two Norse prose sources - Ragnars saga loðbrókar and þáttr af Ragnarssona, Sigurðr was born to prove that his mother, Áslaug, was actually the daughter of Sigurðr Fáfnisbani and the Valkyrie Brýnhildr. Ivarr, Hvitserkr, and Bjorn are also Áslaug's kids, according to these sagas, but Sigurðr's brand (a snake curled around his iris) apparently gave him weird powers - he was able to provoke his brothers into battle against the king of Sweden, and join them on the field, at the ripe old age of 3. The saga does claim that ""he will disdain gold"" \[ **hann vildi hata gullinu** \] which could be some kind of justification for why he doesn't stay in England with the rest in the Great Heathen Army, but it's not clear.

So much for them - they're attested quite broadly, from sources that could not possibly be borrowing from each other! But what about Ragnarr?

The Ragnarr legend is evidently quite old - certainly, the ""Ragnarssons"" were claiming descent from him! Additionally, the oldest known piece of Skaldic poetry, Bragi Boddason's Ragnarsdrápa (Praise Poem of Ragnarr), is attributed to him in the 9th century. However, the legend as it is presented in the Norse sources does not line up with the deeds of anyone claimed to be the historical Ragnarr, such as the Reginherus that the Annals of St. Bertin claim led the siege of Paris in 845. The Ragnarr legend had multiple oral traditions circulating - one is preserved in Saxo's *Gesta Danorum* and the other is found in *Ragnars saga.* These two are in some ways very different, but both are 300 years or more distant from the historical time period, so we can't really trust them. The deeds he did, consolidating Scandinavia under his rule which he then divided amongst his sons, does not fit the historical realities of the period - Denmark was uneasily unified, but Norway and Sweden weren't even close then! Additionally, significant details of the legend are clearly modeled on Sigurðr Fáfnisbani's tale - beyond the obvious link I described above, Ragnarr kills a dragon to win his first love, who he ultimately does not spend his life with (like Sigurðr with Brynhildr) and he dies in a pit of snakes (like Gunnarr Gjukason, Sigurðr's brother-in-law). These similarities make that version clearly a partner piece to *Volsunga saga*, and not a reliable source for history. But, it does reflect some part of what was important about the legend, and that just doesn't line up with any known historical figure. The Reginherus of the 845 siege seems to be either co-ruler or a subordinate king under Horik of Denmark, which doesn't line up at all with how the legendary Ragnarr was undisputed ruler of most of Scandinavia. That contradiction is hugely important - it's not like Scandinavia is perfectly dark, and if someone was that wealthy and powerful, we would expect the Frankish sources to mention something, and they just don't.

There's also a question of chronology. The saga clearly doesn't know it very well - Bjorn Ironside and Hásteinn's voyage to the Mediterranean, with the goal of sacking Rome, appears in *Ragnars saga*! But, it's overland, and involves all of the Ragnarssons, and occurs while Ragnar is still alive. Also, the historical Reginherus probably died sometime in the 850s, while the legendary Ragnarr died at the hands of Ælla - given that the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"" says that Ælla only became king of Northumbria in 867 and died later that year in a raid, is a very short window. The saga has no clue about that - Ivarr plots his revenge for a couple of years, and founds London (or York according to the þáttr af Ragnarssona) during that time. As such, it's riddled with so many contradictions on time that we can't with any confidence place a single event of what ""Ragnar Loðbrók"" did.

Hopefully that helps - while the Ragnarssons are independently attested several times in non-Scandinavian material, their ""father"" isn't, and so many contradictions exist between the legends and the fragmentary historical record that it's implausible to attribute its origin to any singular historical figure."
968,AskHistorians,"At the end of Schindler's List, it depicts all the factory workers and guards listening to Churchill's victory speech. Is this how the people of the Third Reich learnt about their unconditional surrender, or was this made up by Spielberg?","On the night of 1 May, 1945, the German airwaves broke with the report of Adolf Hitler's death, Radio Hamburg declaring that:

>From the Fuhrer's headquarters it is announced that our Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, this afternoon at his command post in the Reich Chancellery, fighting till his last breath against Bolshevism, fell for Germany. On April 30 the Fuhrer appointed Admiral of the Fleet Dönitz his successor. The Admiral and successor of the Fuhrer will now speak to the German people.

This was followed by a speech from Reichspräsident Dönitz on Hitler's ""heroic death"", and the continuing struggle. Dönitz's 'Flensburg Government' would have a very brief time to carry on that conflict, with the radio waves continuing to be punctuated with exaltations to resistance. Leading Minister Schwerin von Krosigk's address a day later played into the vain German hopes that the Western Allies would soon come to their senses and all that was necessary was to hold on until they too turned on the Soviets:

>The iron curtain in the east moves closer and closer; behind this, hidden from the eyes of the world, all those people caught in the mighty hands of the Bolsheviks are being destroyed. [...] The world now must make a decision of the greatest consequence to the history of mankind. Upon that decision depends chaos or order, war or peace, death or life.

Even as the Dönitz government faced facts and began negotiations for the surrender of Germany, such broadcasts continued, much to the consternation of the Soviets who, suspicious of the Western powers already, were primed to distrust over the slightest hint of a separate peace. Even the signing at Reims, signed in the early morning of May 7th, was offensive to them due to the possible optics that surrender had been made to the West, despite the presence and consultation with the Soviet military liaison Ivan Susloparov, which required a second, 'official' surrender a day later in Berlin, although it can be noted that the Reims agreement had specified coming into effect on the 8th in any case.

Following the surrender at Reims on the 7th, the Allied powers had something of a conundrum due to the Soviet intransigence. Although Churchill was itching to be the one to break the news, the desire by the Soviets for the 8th to be the ""official"" surrender had meant no announcement was to be made until Stalin agreed. As a result, the first broadcast of the news came not from them, but from von Krosigk on the afternoon of the 7th.

>German men and women! By order of Grossadmiral Dönitz, the Supreme Headquarters of the Army announced today the unconditional surrender of all troops. [...] In the darkness of the future we must be led by the light of the three stars which were always the pledge of real German character: ‘Unity and Justice and Liberty'.

Unaware of the media blackout coming from SHAEF, the BBC upon picking up the German broadcast, sent out an English translation on the radio waves quickly after, which was picked up by American newsman Ed Kennedy who sent it across the Atlantic to the AP. By 3:35 pm in London, the word was getting out, and many stations throughout Europe were blasting out the news. Churchill was quite upset upon hearing the broadcast, remarking  to Admiral Leahy, whom he had called to ask what the heck was going on:

>What is the use of me and of the President looking to be the only two people in the world who don’t know what is going on?

Even as the British public began gathering in Piccadilly Circus for the news they already knew to be made official Churchill continued to be disallowed to make the speech that he so craved. That night, an official communication from the Ministry of Information gave confirmation, but only that the *next day* would be VE Day. The next day, Churchill would give the speech had had been waiting for years to give, timed to coincide with a broadcast from Truman, but it had been somewhat undercut, and by then a surprise to few.

Even then, Stalin was still somewhat perturbed and wished to wait until the 9th for official announcement so as to be sure that the forces on the *Eastern* Front also obeyed the directive, and that surrender didn't only occur in the West. Although told of the time, Soviet radio carried no such broadcast at the time (4 pm Moscow time), Stalin prefering to announce the next day. 

The Germans too were not always pleased with the news, the prospect of the war's end bringing mixed emotions, such as Gen. Boehme, who addressed his troops in Denmark upon receiving word that:

>The Foreign Minister, Count von Krosigk, has announced the unconditional surrender of all fighting forces. I know that this announcement will hit you hard. We are unbeaten. No enemy dared to attack us. Nevertheless, we shall have to submit to the enemy's conditions.

When Prague Radio carried the announcement of surrender, it went even further and gave voice to some of the fears of Stalin, claiming surrender was, in fact, only being made to the West and that continued resistance to the Soviets ought to be continued, resulting in the fighting continuing until the next day, including massacres of civilians. By the afternoon of the 8th though an agreement was reached between the Czech National Army and the Germans to cease all fighting by that evening. Some die-hard pockets did continue into the next day, but fled before the Soviets arrived in the city, to attempt to reach American lines to make their surrender.

So, there was almost a full 24 hours before the first broadcasts of German surrender had been going out to when Churchill and Truman made the victory speeches of their respective governments. Whether one would have heard the former before the latter is entirely dependent on circumstances. There is one coda which must be addressed in your question though which is whether the prisoners at Brünnlitz Concentration Camp would have heard one prior to Churchill. From a purely artistic point of view, it is understandable why Churchill's famed speech would be prefered, least of all for being in English in a film primarily released for an English speaking audience, but it also accords with the historical account, although I can't recall *exactly* how it was presented in the film.

In *Schindler's Ark*, the fictionalized novel which the film was based on, Keneally essentially splits the difference:

>He was awake and in a state of hectic expectation when the news of the German surrender came to him through the BBC in the small hours of May 7. The war in Europe was to cease at midnight the following night, the night of Tuesday, May 8. [...] On the shop floor, the prisoners maintained the usual routines. Yet about noon, the *Herr Direktor* destroyed the pretense of business as usual by piping Churchill's victory speech by loudspeaker throughout the camp.

Although billed as a novel, this is a decently accurate description, although with some minor creative license, most of all the implication that Churchill made his speech on the 7th, when in fact this 'piping' did occur, but on the 8th of course. And of course, as few of the prisoners spoke or understood English, few had as emotional a reaction *directly* to the speech, but the general news of course was very welcome! Still fearful that the remaining guards may yet decide on a death march or extermination though, Moshe Bejski recalled how the broadcast, as well as Schindler's speech later in the day, impacted their mood and resolve:

>The prisoners gathered in groups on the factory floor and discussed the possibility of escape, although this did not seem viable because the Front was nearby and there was nowhere to hide on the outside, even for a few days. Members of a group of people from Budzyn formulated practical plans, for they, along with a few others, were in on the secret of the arms cache at Schindler's small warehouse, the keys to which had been held for several weeks by my brother Uri Bejski. This group included several Polish Army officers and others who had been trained in the use of these weapons.

>When a report on Churchill's speech and the surrender of Germany came in at midday, prisoners on the smaller production floor where the boilers were made burst into consultations. It was decided that the weapons from Schindler's warehouse, including the grenades, would be distributed among the group members at once, and that guards would be posted at every comer of the plant. If an attempt were made to kill the prisoners or take them on a march, the armed group members would pounce on the SS men; rebellion and panic would ensue, and the prisoners would flee for their lives. [...]

>The group members shouldered their rifles after Schindler's speech, and the SS men made no attempt to enter the factory premises.

So anyways, the sum of it is that while Churchill was not the first to announce the end of the war, and the rumors were by that point circulating even in Brünnlitz, his speech was the first word that most of the prisoners heard first hand, and it is clear only that Schindler himself had listened to any of the earlier broadcasts.

However, nobody is sure where Beselick is. What do we know about Beselick's location, and is it common that entire medieval towns are lost in this way?","I can't speak for Bese/Baselick at all, but I will briefly talk about the second part, and only in England from the Anglo-Saxon to Mediaeval period.

There are two types of things going on:

1.  There are settlements of which we have no record.  This is sort of cheating however, because the records are very thin on the ground in the AS period so it's hard to compare something if there's no prior record.  We know settlements exist, because we dig them up during construction (and especially during the Victorian period with the railways), or metal detectorists [accidentally find](https://www.history.com/news/long-lost-anglo-saxon-island-found-under-english-field) them.  Part of the problem is then linking that to a place-name that we may or may not have.  Sometimes we do have the placename, but no idea what it's referring to: Bede mentions numerous monasteries in Wales that we have no idea where they are, and the lack of contemporary maps is a problem (the first good maps come in the mid 1500s).  Things survive generally by accident, and as the AS often built in wood, rather than stone, it makes things harder to find even if we do have a) a name and b) where it should be.

2.  There are settlements which we have record of, but have disappeared (about 3000).  Most of the time they never truly disappear (except maybe in the public eye) - we have records, so we often know where they should be, or we have archaeology to help us.  They disappear for all sorts of reasons.  My favourite is Dunwich, a thriving, major town in East Anglia, with a port, priory, friaries, 6 parish churches, 2 chapels, and a population of 3000.  A storm in 1328 destroys part of the town and moves enough gravel into the harbour to block the port.  Another storm 20 years later washes 400 houses into the sea, and another storm 20 years after *that*, destroyed most of what was left (I think [I found the planning architect!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w82CqjaDKmA)) Sea changes altered other port-oriented towns around the coastline of Britain, meaning that they were now inland, and so they lost their importance.  Climate change affected towns - Britain used to have wineries, but by 1400, they're pretty much all gone, taking any associated settlements with them if they cannot innovate (although often related to the Church).  Some simply disappear- 26% of villages ending with the place-name of 'thorp' disappear in the East Midlands.  Some were cleared by William the Conqueror's creation of the New Forest in Hampshire, the Northern parts of Britain succumbed to Scottish raiding in the 1300s, the French, regardless of their elderberry perfumes, caused a number of Southern coastal villages to be abandoned.  The Black Death took many a medieval village, monks could kick out people so they could build their isolated settlements,  enclosure took over villages during the 15th century, landlords could engross houses if they were feeling rambunctious, building parks could displace people in the later 18-19th centuries.

So it's quite common in England that things disappear, but they generally don't disappear out of history completely- we have hearth tax records, or bits in the Domesday book etc., to help us find them, and then we dig them up (sometimes). Why they disappear is due to a whole host of variegated reasons.  The further back you go of course, the more complicated it becomes (try mapping charters to a modern map for example!) as we have fewer sources to work on."
971,AskHistorians,"I'm a regular, married, male, 30 year old office worker in 1901. What do I actually do in the evenings?","This is both a specific question, but also a fairly broad one, of course, so I would preface by saying that I'm only talking about a very narrow slice of what might be available to you as a married man, comfortably middle-class, in Somewhere-ville, USA. The assumption I'm principally making is that you are a fraternal man, that is to say, a member of a male social club!

From the late 19th century through the early 20th, so smack dab on the point in time of which you speak, being a member of a Men's fraternal organization was quite common, and a sign of middle-class respectability, leading to its label as the ""Golden Age of Fraternity"". Some groups still remain today in fact, although the institution suffered a long decline beginning in the mid-20th century, and include names you might recognize like the Elk's Club, or the Knights of Columbus. The tradition of course dates back further, including more storied groups such as the Odd Fellows and the Freemasons, but the heyday of it in America was centered on the turn of the century.

There was no set model which these groups might follow. Some, such as the Rotarians, were set up to be more centered on giving back to the community. Others, such as the Elk's, were founded to be social clubs All of them were for men only, although often a women's auxiliary would exist, and many were restricted further by race or religion, the most common restrictions being to white Protestants. This of course was the impetus for the creation of other groups, such as the Knights of Columbus, which was created as a mutual benefit society for Catholics, especially those who were recent immigrants.

To get to the heart of the question, these groups existed in several capacities. They had the mumbo-jumo rituals that you often associate with groups like the Masons, often created in direct emulation of those older groups, and members would earn various titles and progress through the ranks in importance. As noted, some might encourage service by their members, others might provide support to their community, a group safety net for all members, or even death benefits for their family, but for our focus here, the socialization can't be ignored! 

Writing a bit later (1922) than your chosen date, to be sure, Sinclair Lewis nevertheless, provides an excellent satire of club life for the middle-class American male in his novel *Babbitt*, writing:

>Of a decent man in Zenith it was required that he should belong to one, preferably two or three, of the innumerous “lodges” and prosperity-boosting lunch-clubs; to the Rotarians, the Kiwanis, or the Boosters; to the Oddfellows, Moose, Masons, Red Men, Woodmen, Owls, Eagles, Maccabees, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Columbus, and other secret orders characterized by a high degree of heartiness, sound morals, and reverence for the Constitution. There were four reasons for joining these orders: It was the thing to do. It was good for business, since lodge-brothers frequently became customers. It gave to Americans unable to become Geheimrate or Commendatori such unctuous honorifics as High Worthy Recording Scribe and Grand Hoogow to add to the commonplace distinctions of Colonel, Judge, and Professor. And it permitted the swaddled American husband to stay away from home for one evening a week. The lodge was his piazza, his pavement cafe. He could shoot pool and talk man-talk and be obscene and valiant.

Lewis is tweaking the nose of the concept here, but there is also a marked grain of truth, too. Membership in these organizations ""represented one of many vehicles for participation in social and political life"", to quote Clawson. They provided the social respectability that in the novel George F. Babbitt, the stand-in for a typical white, middle-class American, craves. They provided social connections and business connections which could, in theory, help one advance in life. Many also provided places for entertainment and leisure, and food service was quite common too. So you, as a 30 year old office worker, at least once a week, are undoubtedly going to *not* go home for the evening and spend it with your wife and child, but rather are going to head to the Club. 

Maybe you are a Booster, like Babbitt was oh-so-proud of, or maybe you are lucky enough to have the right friends and connections, and can spend your evening at the Masonic Lodge. Sometimes, of course, there will be ritual mumbo-jumbo to go through, or on other times, there might be a meeting where some members will be giving speeches. Other times thouh, it might just be you and a few other respectable gentlemen of the town spending an evening together. Perhaps you play bridge, or maybe you discuss the upcoming elections. If you are feeling a bit more solitary, there is probably a nice armchair you can go read the paper in. Dinner will possibly be served, depending on the club. If you are a regular on a specific night, there probably also others who are regulars on that night as well, so there is probably a specific level of camaraderie between you and those fellows, beyond simply your fraternal brotherhood.

As, presumably, a mid-level office worker, business connections are quite important for you as well. Likely other men from your work are members, so you might be discussing business there. Woe be the office worker who *isn't* there, as it might mean their career is going to stagnate! Maybe your boss is a member too, depending on the specific class construction of the club, and this offers a place where you can interact with him as an *equal* rather than an underling! Depending on your business, you might also be able to help your business! Brothers patronize each other, after all. 

Do you work in insurance? Grand! Many of your brothers are going to be coming to *you* as their broker, just like you of course will go to the doctor who is a member when you are sick, and patronize the grocer who proudly calls himself a your brother as well. But these connections don't come free. They are benefits that *come* from the social aspect of the Club. A dues-paying member who never shows his face isn't going to have the same level of trust as one who is front and center at every event, and makes friends with everyone. Are you gunning for that promotion? If you have the most sales this year, will you get a nice raise? One evening a week *definitely* isn't enough! You probably should be going to the club three days a week perhaps? And make sure to alternate which ones! And that doesn't even include the weekends! 

Heck, maybe it would be best to join several clubs! *Babbitt* is satire, but the protagonist certainly isn't *unusual* in being a member of more than one such group. To take one admittedly extreme example, Joseph Cullen Root founded the *Modern Woodmen of America*, and the *Woodmen of the World* after the first group kicked him out, but before that, had joined the Knights of Pythias, the United Workmen, the Odd Fellows, the Masons, founded the Iowa Legion of Honor, *and* previously been in the VAS Society, which kicked him out too. HE might be a bit excessive, but it was hardly unusual. In a study conducted by Connecticut in 1891, it was estimated that adding all the membership of all the clubs ""*would be in excess of the total male adult population of the state.*”

Getting in to these groups varied greatly. Some openly recruited, but this was a sign that it was not particularly prestigious. Others might be a bit less vocal, while the best Fraternal groups, like the Masons, were more of a ""don't ask us, we'll ask you"" kind of deal, which of course was something that you might reach by climbing the ladder. Start as a member of a lower group, and prove yourself to slowly get invited to better and better ones! 

I would reiterate again the assumptions being made here, which more than anything is that you are *white*. Black exclusion from Fraternal organizations was by far the norm, but in response, many African-American men founded their own groups, which provided similar social function, as well as the economic benefits. Many would take on names in emulation of the white groups, such as the black Elks Club, which not so subtly tumbed their nose with the addition name of *Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks*, compared to the white's only group which, as *Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks*, they were clearly an improvement on!

From WWI on, competing sources of entertainment outside the house would start to erode the Fraternal Clubs, such as an official of the Mooses noting in the 1920s how:

>[T]he radio, the automobile, the jazz band, the outdoor entertainment, the fast means of travel [have placed] the old style lodge meeting, in which the same ceremonies, week after week, and month after month, are carried on, somewhat in discard.

And in the post-WWII period, that slide only continued further, for which I would simply direct to /u/yodatsracist in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/b48wpb/why_dont_men_join_secret_societies_anymore/ej5bvoq/), but to return to the beginning, you, as a respectable married man of 1901, would be in their Golden Age. You would be spending at least one evening out there with your Fraternal Brothers, socializing and feeling important. What you do those *other nights* at home though, I will leave to someone else to weigh in on!

972,AskHistorians,"Canada’s Defense Minister claims that in 1961, 50 UFOs flew south in formation towards Russia, then flew back towards the North Pole before the Supreme Allied Commander “pressed the panic button.” Is there any record of such an event?","The Canadian Defense Minister claims that all the information surrounding this are in 'secret files' which he has called upon to be released by government's around the world - so there are no \*\*official\*\* documents relating to it. But there are interviews of people involved in the investigation into said event - which I will go through.

In other words, he has no solid proof and for this specific event he has no proof either. I could only find one bit of information refering to UFO sightings in Europe in 1961 - The national arhives state ""in 1961 the Russian newspaper Pravda reported on space saucers over Soviet territory"" - whether this is related to what the former Canadian Defense Minister refered to or not is unlikely since the report also states describes ""beings from Venus landing in search of cheap oriental sweets."" ([https://media.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php/cold-war-ufos/](https://media.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php/cold-war-ufos/)) .

In the book 'Real Aliens, Space Beings, and Creatures from Other Worlds' By Brad Steiger and Sherry Hansen Steiger, the event is described in greater detail. It follows a man called 'Bob Dean' who was a retired 'Army Command Sergeant Major', who during an interview in ""the early 1990s"". He stated how he became an 'intelligence analyst to Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powes, Europe (SHAPE) in Paris'. This position supposedly gave him the highest top-secret clearance in NATO.

Dean was assigned to the 'Operations Division-Supreme Headquarters Operation Centre' where he supposedly learned that it was a ""war room"".

In the interview, the book goes on to echo what the former Canadian Defense Minister stated - ""\[Dean\] explained that 'SHAPE' was the Central Headquarters Command for all Allied Forces throughout Europe - from the nothern border of Norway clear down to the souther border of Turkey"".

Dean supposedly became aware during his assignment of a 'secret UFO study that has begun in 1961'. This study had supposedly been triggered by an incident in 'February 1961' - which is supported by the Candian Defense Minister's claim - Furthermore, the book goes on to describe how the incident involved ""thirty to fifty enormously large, circular, disc-shaped, metalic objects flying in formation over Central Europe."". This is further supported by what the Canadian Defense Minister claims - especially as in the book the movements of the craft were described as follows: ""These crafts would mysteriously appear flying out of the Eastern zone, over Soviet Russia and the Warsaw Pact nations."" Whilst it doesn't mention the North Pole, it does follows the rough path the former Canadian Defence Minister describes and it took place at the same time, involving the same Supreme Alliad Command system.

Supposedly this incident almost caused NATO and Soviet forces to fire on eachother but there's no evidence of this except for Dean's account.

&#x200B;

All in all, the former Canadian Defense Minister's claims are not backed up by any official government documents but there is an account from an individual who supposedly worked in this 'SHAPE' agency. Sadly Bob Dean passed away aged 89 in 2018 though.

The account of Dean is eerily similar to that of the former Canadian defense minister's - but Dean's is much more detailed. Dean recognised he was 'violating' his 'National Security oath' by conducting this interview. He also describes a 'massive cover-up' which would fit with the former Candian Defense Minister's claim that the files are top-secret.

Here's Bob Dean's wiki: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert\_Dean\_(ufologist)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dean_(ufologist))

You could possibly find out more about him and this specific incident there, especially as it mentions various books he's written.

He is however a well known 'ufologist' and associated with 'conspiracy theories'. So I'll leave it to you to decide whether it's believable.

973,AskHistorians,"In 1956, Guy Mollet, the French Prime Minister, proposed the union between the UK and France with Queen Elizabeth becoming the head of both states. What exactly was the proposal? What was the context of it? How realistic was it?","**Precedence**

There has been propositions of Anglo-French unions throughout history. Some actually came to fruition thanks to dynastic and military manoeuvres. I name the Angevin Empire of the 12th-13th century as an example. So the one proposed by Guy Mollet, 94th Prime Minister of France, was not without precedence.

**Context**

It came about as France and the UK were colluding with each other during the Suez Crisis. Mollet, an argent anglophile, apparently suggested it in September 1956 to Sir Anthony Eden who was the Prime Minister of the UK at the time.

There are some sources on-line which mention that a union was proposed because France was in the throws of economic difficult ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/15/france.eu)) however this goes against historical fact. France boomed after WWII - the so-called and forever gloried Les [*Trentes Glorieuses*](http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199560981.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199560981-e-18) \- thanks to the Marshal Plan.

Indeed, France was floundering domestically. The 4th Republic, established after the WWII was a parliamentary system of government but it was very unstable.  Political coalitions work elsewhere but in France, they don't appear to have ever worked. It was the same under the 3rd Republic (99 administrations from 1879-1940 ([source](http://histoirerevisitee.over-blog.com/2013/11/comprendre-ce-juron-de-gauche-anti-parlementaire.-et-n-ayez-plus-honte.html) in French) and it \[instability\] was the same under the 4th Republic ([source](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1957/3/18/the-fourth-republic-pthe-fourth-french/)). It had 24 administrations in 11 years ([source in French](http://www.cndp.fr/crdp-reims/cinquieme/bilan.htm))

Because of this instability at home, it could not manage or define agreed and coherent policies for the sprawling [French Union/French Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Union). There was open revolt in French West Africa, French Indochina and Algeria - all of which wanted self-determination and decolonisation. The Algiers Crisis in 1958 compelled French politicians to call De Gaulle from retirement, takeover the government and advocate major constitutional reform to establish the current 5th Republic. [(This source gives an outline of its establishment)](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-france-its-fifth-republic-180962983/)

**Proposal**

Eden rejected Mollet's initial scheme of union between the two states. Having studied Eden at length, one can imagine what he said first! However, Mollet returned with a suggestion of France joining the Commonwealth of Nations to which Eden was more receptive. A common citizenship was proposed and France would recognise the monarch of the UK as Head of the Commonwealth in accordance with the [London Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Declaration). Alas, this was ultimately rejected too ([source](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6261885.stm)).

**Realistic?**

We only know of this curious footnote in the history of Europe because a British civil servant minuted his conversation with Sir Norman Brooke, Cabinet Secretary and head of the British Civil Service. There are no real facts of what was behind Mollet's proposal: economic, political or otherwise. Perhaps he was conjecturing.

There are merits in evaluating the British Westminster-system as a bastion of stability compared with the French 4th Republic: 4 Prime Minsters and effectively 2 governments between 1945-1963. The Conservatives from 1951 changed Prime Minister but there was few major policy shifts. While a monarchy is noted for providing stability: Elizabeth has been on the throne since 1952; Baudouin of the Belgians reigned for 42 years and Wilhelmina of the Netherlands for 58 years.

One doubts that either France or the UK would have tolerated such a union. The citizens of Paris would have been on the streets and perhaps the 4th Republic would have collapsed 2 years before it did if Mollet's scheme became public.

**Curiosity**

It is curious to note that 2 years later in 1958, France signed the Treaty of Rome with 5 other nations to establish what became the EU. Was Mollet attempting to create a bolstered *Entente Cordiale* or a rival to Treaty of Rome economic free-trade area with a proposed Franco-British Union? If so, we would have entered into another period of European (economic) Alliance systems: Franco-Britain, EEC and Comecon (for the Soviet Union and their satellite states).

974,AskHistorians,"In 2000, Kazakhstan alerted the world to the existence of Stepnogorsk, a former Soviet biological weapons lab removed from the map. Enough antrax was produced here to wipe out all life on Earth several times over. What is the history behind American and Soviet biological weapons development?","I understand you guys have uncommon rules for posting here, but as a professional microbiologist I have to input: Anthrax could never ‘wipe out all life on earth’ no matter how much of it anyone had.  The title of this post is ridiculous hyperbole.

Bacillus anthracis is the bacterium that produces toxins that causes the disease, Anthrax. These toxins affect mammals, with a sub-100% fatality rate. The vast majority of life on earth I.e. other animals, insects, plants, bacteria etc. would be unaffected by exposure to these toxins.

975,AskHistorians,"Three American Presidents were assassinated in the 36 years between 1865 and 1901, making it a shockingly common occurrence for a modern first world nation at the time. Do we know what affect this had on the national psyche? Did any prominent figures reflect upon it publically?","I actually have an answer to this one, thanks to the excellent book *Murdering McKinley* by Eric Raunchway. It fundamentally altered the way America looked at criminal psychology, and it definitely had its effects on culture and politics as well.  

After execution of Charles Guiteau for his assassination of President Garfield, it was becoming more and more accepted that Guiteau was insane. A smaller group began claiming he couldn't fully be held responsible for his actions. These people called themselves ""alienists"".

After Leon Czolgosz gunned down McKinley in Buffalo just 20 years later, alienists began to take interest in Czolgosz's mental state. *Murdering McKinley* follows Dr. Vernon Briggs as he tries to determine if Czolgosz is insane or not. Ultimately, he does not come up with a compelling case to cast doubt about Czolgosz's sanity but it was one of the first major cases on a national level where psychological analysis of the suspect played a major role. [Twenty years later](http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2524&context=jclc) Briggs would get a law passed in Massachusetts that formalized the psychological aspect of criminal justice as we know it today. The word ""alienist"" fell out of favor and it became more proper to refer to doctors like Briggs as ""psychologists"". 

If you're looking at this from a political and cultural standpoint I think the best place to start is [Teddy Roosevelt's telegraph](http://www.shapell.org/manuscript/tr-mckinley-assassination) upon hearing that McKinley had been shot (at that point McKinley was still alive): 

> ""I am so inexpressibly shocked & horrified that I cannot say anything""

There was a similar feeling of shock and disgust during the Guiteau trial after Garfield's assassination as well. Several political cartoons [made him look like a monster](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Cartoon_of_Charles_Guiteau_by_Miriam_Leslie_d_1914.jpg) or a [gun wielding maniac](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Guiteau_cartoon2.jpg)

There was a sense of panic and dread with all of these assassinations, the Lincoln assassination lead to the trial of confirmed and alleged co-conspirators including the ~~probably~~ *maybe* innocent Mary Surratt who owned the boardinghouse that Wilkes and co. were staying in. She was executed which was apparently controversial even at that time as they was a campaign to have President Johnson grant her clemency.

I think a fitting way to end this is to go over the stranger-than-fiction life of Robert Todd Lincoln. As Lincoln's son he was one of the first people to see his father's corpse after the assassination. He was inspired by his father and became a prominent figure in the Republican party, becoming Secretary of War under President Garfield. He was with Garfield when he was shot by Charles Guiteau. Later in life, he was attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo when a panic came over the festivities and he learned that just a few buildings over President McKinley had been shot. Allegedly, Lincoln responded to another Presidential invitation later in life with this response: ""No, I'm not going, and they'd better not ask me, because there is a certain fatality about presidential functions when I am present.""

977,AskHistorians,"A former IBM employee told me today that in the early 1970s, when he started working there, IBM required employees to wear ""dark suits, white shirts, and wingtips"" everyday. Was IBM unique in this or were other tech companies just as formal?","Even amidst the more formal business dress code of the day (until the 1980s, men wore a suit to work in most jobs and industries), the IBM dress code was legendary for being strict and formal. While suits were the norm, IBM's dress code was notorious for being unrelenting. Bob Bemer, a computer scientist at IBM, recalls being horrified that a colleague attended an event in merely a sports jacket. In [Denial](https://books.google.com/books?id=l9sBBZA4n2oC) (R.S. Tedlow, 2010), Sam Albert recalls being confronted in the elevator and scolded for not wearing sock garters.

The reasoning for the strict dress code is hard to pinpoint, but most writers ascribe it to the philosophies of CEOs Thomas J. Watson (until 1956) and his son Thomas J. Watson, Jr. (until 1971): that IBM was a unique place of impeccable standards and service, and every element of customer communication and presentation must reflect that. They rejected the ""disheveled salesman"" stereotype of the 1920s-30s caricatured by door-to-door vacuum salesmen and the like. 

It wasn't until the 1980s-1990s and the emergence of Silicon Valley as a economic force that more casual business dress became the norm, exemplified by Microsoft's famously lax (at the time) dress code. This was partly because the workplace became dramatically younger, and partly because companies like the new Microsoft wanted to distinguish themselves from (in their view) older and stodgier technology companies. 

But it was also because of an [astute marketing campaign by Levi Strauss](http://www.levistrauss.com/unzipped-blog/2014/07/dockers-and-the-birth-of-casual-fridays/) to send information about the benefits of ""business casual"" dress codes to tens of thousands of human resources professionals. The materials featured Dockers (a Levi's product), and the campaign's infiltration of the Silicon Valley culture is credited with the polo-and-khakis look that became the de facto uniform of 1990s dotcom and technology companies. 

Incidentally, the IBM dress code was finally abolished by CEO Lou Gerstner in 1995. They have a [gallery of IBM attire](http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/waywewore/waywewore_1.html) on their website.

978,AskHistorians,Why did so many survivors of the Wounded Knee Massacre become guards in Skyrim?,"It's kind of a dick move to joke about the ""Wounded Knee Massacre"" with regard to the Nords in Skyrim.

It's just another imperialist narrative that erases the true indigenous peoples of Tamriel. The Dwemer, Snow Elves, and Reachmen all have long histories in Skyrim that predates Nordic settlement.

Nordic nationalist groups are engaged in an ideological project that tries to erase the previous inhabitants of the lands, pushing the surviving Reachmen to the most infertile and inhospitable parts of the province, consigning them to mountaintops and infertile lands where they are disconnected from the broader society and economy.

In terms of the Dwemer and Snow Elves, the battle cry that ""Skyrim belongs to the Nords!"" shows modern Nordic attitudes towards the first peoples: one that erases these peoples from history in favour of a settler colonialist narrative.

To co-opt the ""Wounded Knee Massacre"" from the indigenous inhabitants is a part of the broader imperialist project. Ignoring the rich pre-Nord history of Skyrim is a disservice to true understanding of the province."
979,AskHistorians,"In The Witcher series the protagonist is a medieval professional monster hunter for hire--are there historical equivalents, persons specifically hired to track and kill beasts terrorizing livestock, peasants, etc.?","As usual, I can only speak for the Roman period. 

In the imperial era, hundreds of men were employed as professional or semi-professional beast hunters. Their primary function was to capture animals alive for the arena, but they were also called to drive off or destroy animals that threatened crops or farmers. 

Many of these hunters were Roman soldiers. Detachments hunted lions in Algeria, bison in Bulgaria, and everything between. A few soldiers, in fact, became semi-professionals, and received titles like *ursarius* – bear hunter. An inscription informs us that one of these men, a centurion on the German frontier, managed to capture 50 bears in six months. 

However, at least in some provinces (above all in North Africa), professional hunters, often organized into guilds, did the majority of the hunting. The hunting guilds could be contracted by everyone from the members of a city council to the emperor himself to supply a given number of animals by a set date. At times of particularly high demand, guild members might be aided by freelance hunters, who probably collected a bounty for every animal they captured. 

The driving motivation behind most of this hunting, as mentioned, was to collect animals for the *venationes* (beast hunts) that dominated the morning events of many games. But the same men who gathered animals for the arena could easily turn their talents to destroying pests or predators.

Some of the animals they had to cope with, admittedly, were a little less intimidating than the monsters in the Witcher series. In fourth-century Egypt, for example, a priest requested nets (and apparently some skilled hunters) from the commander of a local cavalry detachment to deal with a large herd of gazelles that had been devouring the crops of local farmers. 

Farmers on marginal lands in North Africa, whose livestock was regularly attacked by lions, seem to have regularly called upon professional hunters and/or Roman soldiers for help. Such expeditions were routine enough to be described by the third-century author Julius Africanus, who outlines how professional trackers (*vestigatores*) from the legions would hunt lions to their lairs (*Cesti* 7.14).

The services of the soldiers and professional hunters in clearing the countryside of dangerous animals were widely recognized, most notably by the late antique poet Luxorius: ""The countryside marvels at the triumphs of the amphitheater, and the forest notices that strange wild beasts are there \[in the arena\]...the fertile land loses nothing, and the plants grow in the greater abundance, while all the wild beasts fear their fates \[in the arena\]"" (60 \[Rosenblum\]).

On Roman methods of hunting wild animals, I refer you to [my page on the topic](https://toldinstone.com/how-did-the-romans-capture-animals-for-the-colosseum/)."
980,AskHistorians,"Why is Capitalism considered to have started c. the 16th century, when cities like Florence had institutions like banking, etc. plus a sort of Republic? Why aren't places like the Roman Empire considered capitalist, if there was trade, private property, etc.?","The short answer is that there *are* scholars who consider these places to be capitalist: Braudel called 13th century Florence capitalist, and quite famously Max Weber argued for the existence of ""ancient capitalism"" in Rome and China. 

It all boils down to what one means by capitalism. ""Capitalism"" is a remarkably elastic term that means a variety of things to different authors. Braudel, for example, focuses on long-distance trade and commerce, and consequently finds ""that capitalism has been potentially visible since the dawn of history, and that it has developed and perpetuated itself down the ages."" Likewise, Weber defined capitalism primarily in terms of rationally calculated profit-seeking behavior. The *Cambridge History of Capitalism*, which I think is fairly representative of mainstream economic historians, defines capitalism in terms of four elements:

> 1. private property rights
> 2. contracts enforceable by third parties
> 3. markets with responsive prices
> 4. supportive governments

Defined in this way, capitalism would seem to exist basically anywhere a relatively free market exists, and unsurprisingly the authors find examples of capitalism going back to antiquity. If one defines capitalism in terms of the existence of private property and the pervasive operation of markets, then one can find capitalism virtually anywhere. Even definitions of capitalism that focus on markets in land and labor, for instance, have to contend with the fact that these are very widespread phenomenon: the economic historian Bas van Bavel, for instance, has found evidence of widespread labor markets in ancient Mesopotamia (cf. his *An Invisible Hand?*). 

So there *are* historians, both old and new, who would argue that capitalism pre-dates the 16th century. 

There are also historians who tend argue the opposite, that capitalism is fundamentally modern. Generally speaking, these historians tend to be of a Marxist or *marxisant* orientation. They tend to define capitalism in narrower terms, focusing on the relations people form in the process of production. For example, the economic historian and Marxist Robert Brenner argues that capitalist ""social-property relations"" only prevail where the following is true:

> 1. Economic agents must be separated from their means of subsistence. Though they may possess means of production - tools and skills - the individual economic agents cannot possess their full means of subsistence, i.e. all that is necessary to allow them to directly produce what they need to survive. What this usually means is that, at minimum, they must be deprived of ownership of land [...]
> 2. Economic agents must lack means of coercion that would allow them to reproduce themselves by systematically appropriating by force what they would need from direct producers.

Brenner is quite famous for arguing that these conditions generally did not hold true anywhere in the world prior to England in the late 15th/early 16th century. This sparked a controversy known as the ""Brenner Debate"" among both Marxist and non-Marxist historians. Even within the Marxist tradition, however, there are disagreements over what exactly constitutes ""capitalism."" The late antique Marxist historian Jairus Banaji, for instance, has *also* argued that elements of capitalism existed in ancient Rome. 

Ultimately there isn't a definitive answer to your question because there is no definitive definition of capitalism that all scholars use. It only makes sense to ask this question with respect to a *specific* definition. For the authors of the *Cambridge History of Capitalism*, both Florence and Rome have elements of capitalism, if not capitalism itself; for someone like Brenner, these are societies that lack the specific characteristics of capitalist production. At the end of the day it depends on who you are asking.

What traits did ""dark"" refer to?","We can start out by thinking about the 1941 movie *Tall, Dark, and Handsome*. There are a couple possibilities - the film was popular enough to make the phrase into a cliche, or it was a cliche already and the title was playing off of it. While the film seems to have been reasonably popular, this seems to be a case of the latter. 

The Oxford English Dictionary has citations of the phrase going back to 1906, but their list isn't exhaustive, and you can find the phrase in sources like the New York Times, the LA Times, and the Washington Post in the 19th century, back to the 1860s ([here's a wedding announcement from 1888](https://i.imgur.com/S40n4WL.png) in the NY Times that uses the phrase).

Interestingly, that Times citation is describing a woman, even though the cliche today is men-oriented (the OED's listing of a phrase even says ""denoting a type of attractive man""), and other usages seem to suggest it was gender-neutral early on. The point where it became a cliche, and where it became gendered, appears to be with Mae West's usage of it to describe Cary Grant in the 1933 film *She Done Him Wrong* - a quote giving this explanation is specifically highlighted in the OED's listing. The movie was a hit (it also had Mae West's line ""Why don't you come up some time and see me?"" which made AFI's 100 Years, 100 Movie Quotes list), so it's not unbelievable, and Brewer's Dictionary of Modern Phrase & Fable (John Ayto and Ian Crofton, 2006) dates its status as a stock phrase to the 1930s, so that lines up.

As to the meaning, ""tall"" and ""handsome"" seem pretty self-explanatory, but ""dark"" is ambiguous. The film *Tall, Dark, and Handsome* starred Cesar Romero, who had Cuban and Spanish parents, and the NY Times citation I link above is also describing a Cuban woman. The Washington Post [used it in 1900](https://i.imgur.com/yk2b7Jq.png) to describe a Spaniard, and [again in 1909](https://i.imgur.com/37Vro94.png) to describe an Italian man. That suggests there may be some ""ethnic"" component to it. However, Cary Grant was described that way, and he was a British-born actor. He was indeed tall and handsome, but his ""darkness"" seems to just be his hair and eye color. Given that he seems to be the cliche-making use of the phrase, it would suggest that that's what people consider ""dark"" in using the phrase, though dark hair and eyes often correlate with Hispanic ancestry anyway."
982,AskHistorians,I came across a paper written after Lee’s surrender. It indicates that even at this date some in the Confederacy were still holding out hope for victory. It seems incredibly badly informed. How well were southerners informed about the war’s progress? When did they realize they had lost?,"Hi -- the mod-team noticed that this is attracting a whole bunch of short, speculative answers and it's probably due to a typo in the body of the submission:

I assume you mean 1865, not 1856, but unfortunately due to that right now all you're getting is people wandering in from r/all and dunking on you for the typo. We went ahead and removed the question temporarily.

983,AskHistorians,"Smoking was prevalent in the 20th century. When NASA was first choosing astronauts for the space program, was this a consideration? Were any of the astronauts smokers? Did NASA reject smokers, or deliberately hire non-smokers as astronauts?","Oh yeah, everyone smoked.

My favorite story isn't actually NASA; it's one of the X-15 pilots. For those of you unfamiliar--the X-15 is an airplane that is capable of breaking the space barrier (50 miles up). Milt Thompson talks about how he used to smoke *in the simulator*--and pilots did not get much time in there per flight.

But obviously this question *is* about NASA, so onward.

Pretty much from the beginning, NASA did not want astronauts smoking. Smoking was part of the wild/rebellious idea of masculinity (as James Dean has come to star in the modern American imagination), which was the diametric opposite of the goal. As Roger Launius describes the first press conference announcing the Mercury 7, in 1959:

> The event made the astronauts public figures. Beforehand, they were a crew-cut, military-minded, mad-monk, thrill-seeking, hard-drinking, woman-chasing, flying-fool gang of daredevils. Now, suddenly, they became heroes of a nation.

And the press conference solidified the idea that the astronauts' *character*, and let's face it manliness, was what was really on display. The questions focused on their families, emotions, getting around to the very Cold War-timely themes of patriotism (""God, country, family"").

Oh, yeah--and directly on smoking. Three of the astronauts smoked *during* the press conference, which drew a question from a reporter--will they smoke during their flights?

[Says a NASA doctor:](https://youtu.be/FXj5lc_QUOM?t=464)

> I think they're pretty mature men, and we'll leave it up to them in large part. **Of course, we have a few months for an indoctrination program.**

It's a joke and it gets the laugh Lovelace wanted. But it's definitely comic *relief*. Basically as soon as the reporter mentioned it, NASA officials twigged that it was a problem. Not because of the safety factor--because of the public image.

So no, smoking was not a consideration in astronaut selection. But lack of *public* smoking, as part of the ""all-American"" masculine model, became more or less mandatory."

985,AskHistorians,Why was cocaine so widely used in the 70s and 80s?,"So, let’s get into it, shall we. The 80s were the time when cocaine certainly peaked in its glamour in American culture, but also (as happens when you come off a cultural high), quickly lost it with the rise of freebasing and added racial and socio-economical aspects. To see how this drug got to the top, we will have to turn to the 1970s and 3 key places, which affected the rise of the white powder: Peruvian Huallaga Valley, Colombian Medellín and Washington D.C. (dun dun dun!). Btw, I suspect you got these fascinating ads from [this gallery](http://imgur.com/a/Ipsek), which has plenty of great pieces in it. I honestly can’t tell you much that you don’t know about it. It seems that putting out something like this is perfectly legal, barring few specific state legislations and there was demand for these products, so…

Peruvian coca leaves were the main source of cocaine in its first international boom, roughly begining in 1880s and ending sometime after the WWI. It started as a perfectly legal, lauded substance and the main demand on the growers of coca was by emerging pharmaceutical giants like German company Merck. This supply line was mostly cut when the The 1912 Hague International Opium Convention included cocaine in the proceedings and made the drug trade illicit. And while the drug certainly had its heyday in the 1920s, not long after that it basically went into a prolonged stasis, nearly being forgotten (talking about the U.S. now). This meant that the supply of it, if someone wished to feed this particular vice, was short and extremely pricy. 50s and 60s cocaine was very expensive and there wasn’t much of it. In 1968, the overall seizure of cocaine across the U.S could be measured at roughly 14kg. 

The change started to occur  when failed agricultural reforms and unstable governance led to a renewed interest of Peruvian farmers in growing of coca. Peru always provided crude coca products, either leaves or a basic paste, which was then refined and transported elsewhere through various routes. Bolivia was important at the beginng and so was Chile, which constituted the main vein through which coca products became refined into cocaine and then sold into the U.S. However, with the help of the U.S., Pinochet began cracking down (no pun intended, but what it’s there) on cocaine pretty hard, eventually effectively dismantling this important route of the black market. 

The new opportunity came in the form of “entrepreneurs” in the Colombian Meddelín. The particular details of these operations are kind of hazy, since it’s not exactly the safest re of research, but the basic version is, that emerging Colombian cartels had several advantages over anyone else. Besides the well known ruthlessness, infiltration of governmental organizations and so on, at the beginning, the Peruvian supply of crude materials could have been refined and put through the “pipeline”, which Colombians were using for a long time to smuggle marijuana into U.S. (“Colombian Gold”). 

This gets us to my second favourite Milhouse, Richard M. Nixon and his anti-drug policies. His starting of the war on drugs, often quite misguided in its aims, helped immensely in cocaine’s rise in popularity. Marijuana and heroin were the main culprits, blamed at the start of this campaign, even though many experts even then proclaimed its relative harmlessness. Here’s the thing, they did the same about cocaine, but unlike the (one can argue ollogicaly) targeted marijuana,  the stance helped cocaine to slip under the radar and into the noses. 
Recreational use of cocaine was slightly moving upwards since the 60s in the U.S, thanks to Cuban exiles. But marijuana remained the number one into the 1970s, until the Nixon approved crackdown, which led to shortages and looking for a different source of relatively harmless high. Which is how cocaine was often introduced, by dealers who switched from marijuana to cocaine. Furthermore, since the governmental campaign was painting marijuana as what many could perceive rather hyperbolic type of evil, it was easy to dismiss any official warnings about the drug. 

Administrations after Nixon didn’t exactly stem cocaine’s rise either. White House and related official organizations really underestimated the drug’s growth and gave it a low priority in their assessments of the wider drug problem. One official even proclaimed in an interview that if one would make a case for legalizing marijuana, it would be just as easy to do so for cocaine. To quote one of the examples of this from Paul Gootenberg’s fantastic book

>A presidential “White Paper on Drug Abuse” in 1975 awarded cocaine a “low priority”— below every other drug except then-tolerated marijuana — because, it averred,
“cocaine does not result in serious consequences such as crime, hospital
emergency room admissions, or death.”

There’s a theory of drug epidemics by prof. David Musto, from Yale, which basically boils down to a loss of societal memory affecting the re-emergence of a certain drug. Cocaine was a big problem and something of a scourge in the first decades of the 20th century in U.S and Europe, but because its trade, official and illicit was suppressed, the subsequent generations lost touch with the negative effects of cocaine abuse. When it was introduced again, it became associated with cultural and economic elites, as opposed to the counter-cultural conotations of marijuana and substances with psychedelic effects. New Hollywood and Wall Street high rollers embraced it and sometimes very openly talked about it in positive light. 

So, to attempt a concise (and very basic) answer, the 80s cocaine boom was a result of a “drought” of other types of drugs, thanks to U.S. policy in the late 60s and 70s, the fact that the Peruvian farmers embraced coca as a valuable crop in the face of economic crisis and the quickly expanding Colombian cartels, which were both cruel and imaginative in its economic practices. This resulted in great supply, low prices and when the cultural elites decided this was the drug of their choice, it helped it to slip into the mainstream.

987,AskHistorians,How did veterans of the the first world war react to the outbreak of the second?,"A quick preface. As a general rule, we don’t post where we moderate. Even though we’d like to think we can be pretty objective, it just is bad practice, and obviously I’ve been moderating this thread. But we also don’t like to see popular questions go unanswered, and despite being active all day, this one unfortunately is still that way, and it is impossible not to have some curiosity watching it sit there to boot. So that all being put out there, I have given it a shot, but I would also note I have immediately removed this post myself, and left it to other members of the moderation team to make any appropriate judgements on it. If you are reading this and think this is BS, yell at them not me!

———————

So, now, as to the question itself, it isn’t an easy one to answer, and offering a truly broad overview of “veterans”, even in a single country let along many of them, is a fairly gargantuan task which I suspect has at least in part been why this remains unanswered. I’m not going to take such a Macro view here, but instead focus narrowly, quite narrowly in fact, on one veteran, although a rather prominent one.

Sgt. Alvin York was a Medal of Honor winner in “The Great War”, and certainly one of the most famous - if not the simply best known - American soldier of that conflict in the years after. His heroics, single-handily taking on a massive amount of Germans, not only made for a stirring story, but his biography - a one time conscientious objector turned war hero - only added to the aura. 

Two decades later, as the Second World War broke out and America initially stood on the sidelines, York proved to be a fairly vocal proponent for increased American involvement. Even prior to the beginning of “World War II”, York had shown himself to be a stirring voice against isolationism, and of the potential for American military power to be a guarantor of world peace. In 1937, as the Second Sino-Japanese War was already seeing hundreds of thousands of casualties in Asia, he rather insightfully noted the possibility that continued Japanese incursions would draw America into the war. Not only was he of the belief that the US needed to stand “*ready to fight again in the interest of peace*”, but even that the US ought to be more forceful and proactive - “*I’d just as soon get into it now as later*”. He also wasn’t sparing Hitler in his views, although initially less forceful about actual American intervention. Commenting to reporters at a memorial event held just in the wake of the Munich Agreement, he showed no illusions that Hitler would remain satisfied, opining that “*If we want to stop Hitler, we must knock him off the block*”. A few months later, as the world continued to inch closer to war, he told reports that the United States had a duty to rearm, and “*ought too be prepared to defend the Western Hemisphere*”, and although he expressed optimism that conflict might still be averted, he felt America needed a strong military in the event war did break out, for a bristling armed neutrality.

The outbreak of war in Europe, of course, only bolstered his views, giving truth to his prophecies, and shifting his mind from a mere necessity to defend America against potential invasion to the possible need to return 'over there'. In the fall of 1940, the United States having just begun the augmentation of its armed forces with its first ever peacetime draft, York was not only an active proponent of the measure, but offered himself up for active involvement as well. Although in his early ‘50s and well past service age, he served on his local county draft board. Recalling his own religions beliefs that had initially kept him from taking up arms, int was reported at that time that he was planning to speak with any local conscientious objectors in an effort to change their minds, similar to how his own had been in conversation with an officer.

As the war in Europe continued, he only became more vocal. In the Spring of ’41 at a banquet held at the Alvin C. York Institute, a private school he had founded, he beat the drum of war, strongly opining that the United States had a moral duty to be involved, and castigating the isolationists:

>America now stands at a crossroads. This is no time to compromise with Hitlerism. Those who advocate such a source are following the illusion which has already plunged Europe over the brink of annihilation.

Late in July, he gave a speech to the Tennessean Society on the necessity of continued aid to the beleaguered UK, noting that ""*we must give England every aid we can, and as quickly as we can""*. American 'boots' on the ground were still something that he had reservations about, but he certainly had no doubt about which side was right, and America's obligation to be backing them.

These speeches, in fairly small settings, were nevertheless notable enough for the national news, and later in the year, York words echoing similar sentiments would be heard on a much more national stage in any case. Even aside from his Gary Cooper staring biopic that came out win the summer of ’41 - a strong image of the American citizen-soldier for the audiences’ minds, and likely to “be useful in awakening America in a time of crisis” as FDR himself noted - on the Armistice Day (Veterans Day) ceremony at Arlington Cemetery, less than a month before the United States would find itself at war, Yorks earlier remarks from a Memorial Day speech were utilized by the President himself, who quoted his response to critics:

>The thing they forget is that liberty and freedom and democracy are so very precious that you do not fight to win them once and stop. Liberty and freedom and democracy are prizes awarded only to those peoples who fight to win them, and then keep fighting eternally to hold them.

>Whatever we knew or thought we knew a few years or months ago, we know now that the danger of brutality, the danger of tyranny and slavery to freedom loving people can be real and terrible.

To be sure, none of this ought to be taken as *the voice* of American veterans. The result of that conflict had been considerably less than hoped for for many American veterans who had gone “over there” thinking they were making the world safe for Democracy, and felt little had come of it. Especially prior to 1939, York has earned pushback from groups like what would coalesce as the America First Committee, the ‘premier’ isolationist group in the country, although it by no means abated even after the invasion of Poland. In Memorial Day speech quoted by FDR, it was to those detractors that he had address himself, responding to the people who had asked him *“You fought to make the world safe for democracy. What did it get you?”*

Just how reflective was this of the actual quality of life for the residents of a castle?

Sure the Duke might have as good a bedchamber as possible, but how was the person who emptied his chamberpot faring when it came to basic comforts?"
989,AskHistorians,"During Nazi occupation, how did taxes work? Did French and Polish people pay taxes to the German government?","It depends on the time and the place.

In France, the French government retained sovereignty over the whole country. After the Battle of France had been decisively lost in 1940, the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, tried and failed to convince the rest of the cabinet to evacuate the government to Algeria or Britain and continue fighting from there. Reynaud resigned rather than carry out the cabinet's desire to sue for peace, and the President (Albert Lebrun) appointed Marshall Philippe Petain (the leader of the surrender faction in the cabinet) to replace him. Petain asked Germany for an armistice, which Germany granted on terms that amounted to a surrender. Among other provisions, Northern and Western France (about 60% of Metropolitan France, including Paris) would be occupied by Germany until a final peace treaty was agreed (it never was, nor were negotiations ever begun in earnest), and France would be assessed an exorbitant fee to pay for the occupation. The rest of France (including the colonies) would remain unoccupied under the direct control of Petain's government.

Petain set up a new capital in Vichy, a small resort town in the unoccupied zone. There, the French Parliament voted itself out of existence and granted Petain dictatorial powers (ending the Third Republic and establishing what we now refer to as Vichy France). In the unoccupied zone, citizens paid their taxes as normal, except they were sent to Vichy instead of Paris. In the occupied zone, the German military and the French civilian administration had overlapping jurisdiction: the French bureaucrats still nominally worked for the government in Vichy, but they were required by the terms of the occupation to follow the policies of the occupation authorities. In the occupied zone, then, taxes were still assessed according to French law, by administrators who worked for the French government, but they operated under the direction and supervision of the German military. In practice, this supervision seemed to be relatively light: Petain's government's policies were aligned enough with German interests, and the German occupation's administrative resources were small enough, that the Germans mostly let Vichy set policy for the occupied zone. In both zones, the taxes went to Vichy, and in accordance with the armistice agreement, Vichy paid Germany the agreed-upon costs of the occupation (which were much higher than the actual costs, so Germany turned a substantial profit).

In November 1942, after Britain, America, and anti-Vichy French exile forces (""Free France"") successfully invaded France's North African colonies (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), Germany executed Case Anton, occupying the remainder of Metropolitan France. The Vichy government remained in operation, however, and the French civilian administration continued running under German occupation.

Nazi-occupied Poland was divided up into two zones (plus a third zone in the East, which was annexed by the Soviet Union). Northern and Western Poland (a bit past the pre-WW1 borders of Imperial Germany) were annexed to the German Reich. They were integral parts of Germany, and were administered and taxed directly by the German government under German law and Nazi policy. The remainder of Poland was put under a special German occupation administration called the General Government, lead by a senior Nazi Party official (Hans Frank) who served as Governor-General of Poland. Frank and the other senior officials of the General Government ruled by decree, and they administered the territory mostly through imported German officials. The existing Polish civilian police were drafted into German service under German senior officers (mostly from the German civilian police) and used to help enforce the General Government's rule. The General Government collected taxes for its own internal use, and as with Vichy, they also sent a substantial portion of their revenue to Germany, officially as a reimbursement for the costs of the occupation.

990,AskHistorians,"Did ancient Romans call each other by their ""first name"" (praenomen, e.g., “Hello, Marcus”), or would they have called each other by “last names” (nomen & cognomen, e.g., “Hello, Cicero”)?","You know, that's a really great question! Roman names are kinda funky at best, and knowing how people communicated then, as now, is super important. So it depends. How well do the people know each other, what the setting of the communication is, and who's communicating with whom. I'll do my best to avoid an extended discussion of names in the Roman world (though, for the record, they're super cool and let us identify everything from a person's social status to their probable ancestry and/or family history. Seriously, it's possible to tell from a name that someone was of an aristocratic Syrian family that had been satraps under the Persians, and who were granted Roman citizenship in a certain year).

So, let's say that someone has a standard *tria nomina* - the three name system that so many people are relatively familiar with. For this, I'll use as an example a letter between two relatively famous individuals: [Gaius Julius Caesar and Marcus Tullius Cicero.](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Cic.+Fam.+7.5&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0009) Here, you'll notice how Cicero addresses Caesar, who he knows reasonably well as a fellow politician and member of the aristocracy. 

> CICERO CAESARI IMP. S. D.

The S. D. there are just shorthand for greetings, not important to this, the Imp[erator] is just Cicero sucking up - what's important here are the names: Cicero, referring to himself by his *cognomen*, to Caesar, again, referred to by *cognomen.* Further into the same letter, we see Cicero again referring to Caesar as ""mi Caesar"" (My Caesar, sometimes translated as ""[my] dear Caesar""). Said letter is about a third party - Cicero's asking for a favour for a young man, to whom he is very close. The boy's name was Gaius Trebatius Testa, who you'll note is referred to in the second sentence of the letter (after Cicero's obligatory sucking up), with the ""C. Trebatium"". The C is an archaic holdover (Gaius being spelled Caius - the pronunciation is generally considered to be closer to a G at this point, but I digress), but, again, what's important here is the way Cicero referred to the boy: (abbreviated) *praenomen* (it's *always* abbreviated) and *nomen* - no *cognomen*. This style of address is common throughout Cicero's letters. 

Let's look at some more letters, cause that's what kind of personal communication we have! I'm gonna yank from more common people, because those are far more interesting than the aristocracy anyway. To the Vindolanda tablets! There are a [few letters to and from a guy named Flavius Cerialis](http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/4DLink2/4DACTION/WebRequestQuery?searchTerm=225-280&searchType=number&searchField=TVII&thisListPosition=1&thisPageNum=0), which is helpful because it gives us his name - and, since he wasn't part of the aristocracy (prefect of the Ninth Cohort of Batavians), there's a decent chance that Flavius Cerialis was his full name. So how did people refer to him? Let's go through a few of them (not all 56) real fast. I'll give you a quick warning - they're quite fragmentary (they were found in a swamp, doodled on wooden fragments). 

> Flavius Cerialis Broccho  
> suo salutem  
> si me amas frater rogo  
> mittas mihi plagas  
[...]  
[...]  
[...]  
> fortissime <blank>  
> frustra exercias  
> <blank>

which translates to: 

> Flavius Cerialis to Brocchus, greetings. If you love me, brother, I ask that you send me some hunting nets (?) [...] you should repair the pieces very strongly. 

Now here, you'll note a similarity with Cicero above, but also a subtle difference. Whee that wasn't at all vague. Here, Flavius fullnames himself, while giving only one name to Brocchus. That, in itself, emphasizes that Flavius Cerialis is this guy's full name, but also shows how people really talked to each other. The ""brother"" can't be taken too literally here, cause we don't have much about Brocchus, and people in the military referred to each other with fraternal terms pretty constantly. But the fact that he fullnamed himself indicates that Brocchus probably knew him on a *praenomen* basis - you have to identify *which* Flavius, since that was an incredibly common name, but you know him! It's Flavius! Your buddy! Who needs nets!

> [Cl]odius Super Ceriali suo  
> salutem  
> [V]alentinum n(ostrum) a Gallia rever-  
> sum commode vestem adprobas-  
> se gratulatus sum per quem  
> te saluto et rogo ut ea quae

then the back:

> Flavio Ceria-  
> li praef(ecto)  
> a [C]l[o]dio Supero (centurione)

All of which translates to...

> Clodius Super to Cerialis, greetings. I was pleased that our friend Valentinus on his return from Gaul has duly approved the clothing. Through him I greet you and ask that you send the things which I need for the use of my boys (slaves), that is, six *sagaciae*, (unknown number) *saga*, seven *palliola*, six tunics, which you well know I cannot properly get hold of here, since we are [...] ready? for the boys' (slaves') transfer. May you fare well, my dearest lord and brother, and [...]

> [back]

> To Flavius Cerialis, prefect, from Clodius Super, centurion

Here, we see a familiar style, except that Clodius is definitely a *nomen* more than a *praenomen*. Non aristocratic names are weird, no worries. The centurion was probably just called Clodius, with the Super as his cognomen/army nickname. In his address to the prefect (superior, but reasonably equivalent), he refers to him just by his *nomen*. Why didn't they use a *cognomen* as Cicero does? Well...they didn't necessarily have one - not aristocrats, remember. And since ""Super"" isn't so much a name as it is a ""the big Clodius,"" he'd just be called ""Clodius.""

On the third day before the Ides of September, sister, for the day of the celebration of my birthday, I give you a warm invitation to make sure that you come to us, to make the day more enjoyable for me by your arrival, if you are present. Give my greetings to your Cerialis. My Aelius and my little son send him their greetings. I shall expect you, sister. Farewell, sister, my dearest soul, as I hope to prosper, and hail!

> Back: To Sulpicia Lepidina, (wife) of Claudius, from Severa.

So the letter content, obviously, is super neat here. But we're looking at how these women talked to each other, and it's...basically the same as the men, albeit more affectionate. You have a standard full name introduction, to Lepidina (her *nomen*). 

So letters are pretty standard. Even when you have people whose name came out to be ""Imperator Caesar divi Nervae filius Nerva Traianus Optimus Augustus Germanicus Dacicus Parthicus pontifex maximus tribunicia potestate XIX imperator VIIII consul VI pater patriae (literally snagged this off of a random inscription, guess the emperor),"" letter addresses were kept relatively simple - for example, to that emperor, Pliny the Younger addressed letters as ""C. Plinius Traiano Imperatori"" (Gaius Plinius to Trajan, Imperator), and the emperor responded in turn with ""Traianus Plinio."" Much easier than fullnaming ;) 

Okay, so now you're wondering when I'm actually gonna get to conversation, which is, by now, the elephant in the room. That one's obviously a bit harder to construct, but there are a few tidbits that are accessible to us that can help us to unwind things. Generally, in conversation (or even sometimes letters!) with close family members, the *praenomen* was used.^1 If a name was in a drama, it was usually just shortened to a *praenomen,* or if you wanted to make fun of a caricature (something that Martial does all the time), a *praenomen* was useful. If you wanted to speak spitefully at a person, you'd use their *praenomen*, belittling them and talking down to them (""Alright *Jeff*,"" as opposed to ""I'll take that under consideration, Mr. Bezos""). 

Alternatively, the *praenomen* gave intimacy to the conversation. Horace tells a legacy hunter (young guy trying to get in good with a rich old person on their last legs for the purpose of being in the will):

> Say 'Quintus,' for instance, or 'Publius' (impressionable ears love a praenomen), 'your virtue has made me your friend.'

If you wanted to beg a favour off of someone or seduce them, the *praenomen* was the way to go. A *fantastic* example of this is the infamous Cena Trimalchio, where the master of the house in question (a ridiculously rich freedman named Gaius Trimalchio, a caricature of Nero) is always referred to by his sycophants as ""Gaius."" The *praenomen* worked especially well to flatter freedmen: it was not allowed or permitted in any way for a slave to have one. Therefore, their new *praenomen* was as much a mark of their freedom as anything else. 

Let me know if you have any questions! If you're looking for further reading, I recommend Eleanor Dickey's *Latin Forms of Address: From Plautus to Apuleius* (from whom I shamelessly pillaged some of these translations). All best!

991,AskHistorians,"How would an ordinary ~$20 knife from a sporting good store compare to a knife from say the 1300 A.D. in terms of quality, workmanship, and how well it could hold an edge?","First, a word of warning-my own specialty of weapons of war, and I have not been able to find much in the secondary literature about late medieval knives specifically - as opposed to armour and swords, which have been dealt with extensively. This is thus a more general answer than I would prefer, about medieval ferrous metallurgy in general, and the way it would apply to knife manufacture. You may find my [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4b49zp/how_important_was_good_steel/d167v2t/) about ‘good steel’ in medieval armour and weapons helpful.


As others have noted, the salient difference between a modern knife from a sporting goods store and a 14th century knife is reliability. You basically know what you are getting when it comes to the knife from the sporting goods store - some alloy of steel and chromium, probably (since so many knives in this price range are stainless steel) - indeed many knives advertise their exact alloy composition. You can also expect that it will be essentially homogenous throughout - that the composition of the alloys will be the same throughout. This is because modern steelmaking processes allow nearly exact control of alloy composition, and can ensure uniformity.


The 14th century knife, on the other hand, presents a different picture. Nearly every phase of the manufacture of a medieval knife would be subject to greater uncertainty than modern cutlery. To quote myself from a [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5641mk/so_ive_been_reading_a_few_books_about_ancient/):


To lay out the basic process, to smelt iron from iron ore (which you need to do to get iron/steel, unless you are making an item from a meteorite) you need to heat the ore until the various non-iron bits combine with oxygen (burn off, basically) or melt out. The simplest and earliest way to do this is in a bloomery, where the iron itself never melts but forms a kind of spongey mass of variable composition, a bloom. Alternately, if you make the furnace hot enough you can melt the iron, which produces a high-carbon mass bit of molten ferrous material called cast iron or pig iron. Blast furnaces were invented in 13th century Europe, though the main source of 14th century steel and iron would be bloomeries.


Good quality blades would be made of steel. This can be made in a bloomery under the right conditions. Now, the entire weapon or tool does not need to be made of steel. For some items (swords/knifes/spearheads, files) only the edge or perhaps the surface will need to be made of steel. In order to do this there are two means. The first is to weld a small bit of steel to iron, like making the body of an axe out of iron and then forge-welding a steel blade to it. This is used in traditional Japanese swordmaking, and there is ample evidence for it in medieval European tools and weapons. Some Celtic and Roman swords were made in this way, though the smiths didn't consistently put their hardes material on the edges. The other way of making something partially steel is to case-carburize or 'case harden' it - covering the iron item in a carbon source like plant or animal matter or charcoal and heating it in a low-oxygen environment. Eventually, the iron absorbs carbon and the surface becomes steel.




|In order to make a steel object harder you need to heat treat it by plunging heated medium carbon (.3% or better) steel into a liquid. This changes the structure of the material as it cools rapidly - it forms different crystaline structures - most notably Martensite, a very hard crystalline structure of iron and iron carbide. Now you can plunge it into cold water, (a 'full quench') which produces fantastically hard steel (up to 800 on the vickers hardness scale), to the point where it is brittle. This steel then needs to be re-heated or tempered to reduce its hardness by a little bit and increase its toughness by a lot (so that it is around 380-450 on the vickers hardness scale). Or you can either wait to quench the steel, or quench it into a hot liquid, or interrupt the quench - this is a 'slack quench' - and it hardens the steel somewhat, but not as much. Steels hardened this way are only a little harder than high-tin bronze (like 320 on the Vickers hardness scale compared with 250). Slack quenching was used earlier and more often than full quenching - it is considered an 'inferior' process today, but the lack of extra steps and the perception that it was 'safer' for the object made it more popular (fewer steps also meant there were fewer places where something could go wrong).


There is also the special case of phosphoric iron is iron made from ore with phosphorous impurities in it (bog iron has phosphorous in some cases). This makes it harder - around as hard as a low-tin bronze (up to 200 vickers). Small items can be made from phosphoric iron - a number of medieval 'bodkin' arrowheads are made from phosphoric iron. Unlike carbon steel, phosphoric iron doesn't get harder with heat treatment, and so tops out around 200 vickers hardness or so.

Now, every step of this process - making iron/steel in a bloomery, making that bloom into an object, and then heat treating the (nearly finished) object introduced uncertainty. The original bloom may have uneven carbon content, or include unpredictable slag inclusions. This would make the knife unevenly hard, giving it possible points of failure. While making the bloom into a knife, the smith might introduce additional weaknesses during forging (on weld lines, for instance, if the knife was made in multiple pieces). If the knife was case-hardened, it may be difficult to determine the final carbon content, leaving a knife that was either brittle or still too soft. Finally, heat treatment could either produce a knife that was overtempered - basically as soft as it was when heat treatment began - or too hard if tempering was not successful, leaving the knife prone to breaking. In every step, smiths had only their own eyes and imprecise measurments to gauge the complex chemical processes occurring. It could be hard to tell when things went right, and when they went wrong.

This is not to say that knives were a total crapshoot. People knew that some steels were better than others - there was a trade in steel (in the form of plates or ingots) from Styria in Austria (largely for weapons and armour) and iron from Sweden (in the form of small ‘osmunds’ of iron), and a corresponding trade in finished goods made with these ‘high end’ raw materials. Iron from the iron-producing Ariege region of the French Pyrennes finds its way into goods from Narbonne, while Vicdossis within the Ariege region imported high quality knives made in Parma, in northern Italy. If anything, paying for good quality in medieval steel could produce more pronounced results than paying for good quality in modern metal goods - while modern cheap knives may be bad at holding an edge, they aren’t as likely to fail spectacularly. People would pay for quality, and poor goods could be bought at a discount, to quote the 15th century German preacher Johannes Nider said: ""Every person intends to do his craft (hantwerk) faithfully. If a thing is not good, it sells much more cheaply."" With that said, telling quality was harder then than it is now, the the overall variability was much higher.

So to conclude, a knife in the 14th century might hold an edge quite well while being quite tough (if it was made with heat treated medium-carbon steel). Or it might be brittle, or soft.The high end would be around what a modern knife is, while the low end would be a tool that we would consider rather flawed, but would most of the time be good enough to do the job (unless is broke).

992,AskHistorians,"How common was illegal drinking during the prohibition era? Would the ""average joe"" have been frequenting speakeasies or was this something mainly done by an already more criminal crowd?","It was 1922, and a group of young friends decided to play the 1920s version of SimCity or Civilization. They built a city out of sticks and boards in the garden (the girls, of course, pretending to be men because women can't do construction) and assigned roles--mayor, pastor, and so forth. But then Ray announced that HE was going to be the SALOON keeper.

*Unthinkable!* His friends threw him out of the game.

So Ray, still wanting to play, quietly decided that he was going to be an *out of business* saloon keeper...and built a mock brewery.

His friends threw him out of the game again, this time with a lecture. A long lecture. A lecture that made Ray cry.

...And decide that instead of a saloon, he was going to build a very big church.

Of course this didn't really happen. It's a [1922 children's pamphlet from the Anti-Saloon League](https://www.westervillelibrary.org/antisaloon-outcast). But it's my favorite piece of Prohibition propaganda because it's aimed at children. Yet has no qualms about telling children a story in which the reaction of a once-legal alcohol salesman to Prohibition is...to sell alcohol illegally. 

Temperance crusaders weren't worried about putting dangerous ideas in children's minds. Even kids knew alcohol consumption and sale was still going down.

But looks can be deceiving. And in this case, they were in pop culture at the time, and they are in legend today. Obviously we can't know how much alcohol was sold, how much of that was drunk, and how much private distilling occurred. Nevertheless, Prohibition *did* have a marked effect on drinking in America. 

In a [working paper from 1991](https://www.nber.org/papers/w3675), however, Jeffrey Miron and Jeffrey Zwiebel gathered data from reported deaths by cirrhosis, reported deaths due to alcoholism, reported hospital admissions for ""alcohol-related psychosis,"" and arrests for public drunkenness. By using all four (admittedly problematic) measurements instead of just one, they argue, they can calculate the decrease in drinking during Prohibition. Towards the beginning of the period, alcohol consumption dropped by two-thirds; by the end, it was back up to 60-70% of pre-Amendment levels.

I suspect (and so to Miron and Zwiebel, although for different reasons) that both of these numbers are too optimistic on the side of the anti-alcohol bunch. Straightaway, they're measurements of alcohol *abuse*, not use. But if anything, the *difference* between them points to the decent effectiveness of the 18th Amendment's first years.

There are plenty of reasons why it *seems like* Prohibition barely worked at all, besides modern cynicism (""My drinking club has a D&D problem""). The ongoing propaganda campaigns are pretty minor on the list. Widespread media hang-wringing over WOMEN DRINKING IN PUBLIC NOW OMG because some speakeasies were infamously co-ed (not, however, the ones who advertised openly in the newspapers of Ivy League colleges) was a big one. 

The number of federal agents specifically tasked with hunting down bootleggers was another, regardless of whether they were actually doing their jobs. Some establishments rather famously managed to stay open because authorities looked the other way.

[Anheuser-Busch stayed in business](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5ssyr7/anheuserbusch_was_founded_in_a_city_packed_to_the/ddilb2m/) partially due to brilliant business management, partially due to moving into the non-alcohol market, and partially due to selling very, very, very diluted beer. And also because, well, because New Orleans existed.

But the biggest reason we have such an impression of weaksauce Prohibition all along? Glamour. The people writing accounts of Prohibition, of Prohibition *violations*--and the people of whom the stories are told--are the glamourous, the famous...the *rich*.

Obviously my favorite example here are the people who literally sailed--and for the first time, *flew*--to literal other countries to drink. If the alcohol didn't come to them (and increasingly, of course, it did), they would go to the alcohol.

Or go with the alcohol. Cruise ships could sell drinks, and the 1920s were the era when white-people tourism of the tropics increased dramatically and became a racialized status symbol.

But you can also talk about the--publicized--closures of high-class restaurants. Their former patrons took their business for a whole lot more than just pre-dinner cocktails to speakeasies whose owners could afford to pay premiums for smuggled liquorous liquids.

Middle and lower class people certainly continued to drink, of course. Middle and lower class people drank things that put them in the hospital (or worse) for far more things than ""alcohol-related psychosis."" Could I interest you in a ""Coroners' Cocktail"", perhaps? 

And yes, of course there were downscale speakeasies that we might think of as Saloons Redux. *Very* downscale, hence the dangers. But we're definitely talking about new establishments here, not pre-existing grime-crime backrooms. (Closure of saloons was actually the primary target of prohibition crusaders in the 1900s and 1910s). And given that their purposes were specifically drinking, I'd be really interested in a study of the social lives of *non* drinkers during this decade, versus today's bars where we've got [our choice of hot wings or...hotter wings](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6c27qg/drunk_americans_today_enjoy_gorging_on_wings/dhrkyi4/). 

This is where I think Miron and Zwiebel's stats don't cover enough--I rather figure that rates of seeking medical care (cirrhosis, deaths from alcoholism, &c) differed significantly among different class and location populations.

In fact, ""because it's illegal now"" had basically nothing to do with why people drank less. Even temperance activists knew it. What good was a law, what good was a Constitutional amendment, if the public at large cared more about alcohol than about someone else's moral standards?"
993,AskHistorians,Did Socrates Even Lift?,"Sokrates never wrote anything down, so all we know about him is how he is described by others. These accounts offer limited information about his life and don't always agree on his philosophies. Apart from the contemporary parody of Sokrates in Aristophanes' *Clouds*, we mostly rely on the philosophical dialogues written by two of Sokrates' students, Xenophon and Plato. Whether these authors represented Sokrates' views accurately or merely used him as a mouthpiece for their own ideas is debated. Whether their image of Sokrates as an ugly, poorly dressed, ostentatiously poor old man matched the reality is up for grabs.

So, when we get a quote like this, how can we know whether Sokrates really said it, let alone whether he lived by it? Unfortunately, we can't really know for sure. What we can do, though, is work out how *likely* it is that he held this view, and if so, how likely it is that he held himself to it. To do this, we need to consider the context of the quote.

This context is, in fact, a very short Sokratic dialogue by Xenophon (*Memorabilia* 3.12). According to the text, Sokrates ran into a young acquaintance of his named Epigenes, who was out of shape. Sokrates told him he ought to go do some exercise. Epigenes replied, ""But I'm not an athlete."" At this point Sokrates chewed him out.

The main point of Sokrates' argument, however, is not that men owe it to themselves to train their bodies so they can look their best. The quote you cited (3.12.8) is little more than the cherry on the cake, a closing line meant to convince Epigenes by appealing to his vanity. The entire rest of the argument is that Epigenes owes it *to the state* to train his body, because otherwise *he will be useless in war.* Epigenes *should* think of himself as an athlete, Sokrates argues (3.12.1), because he will have to fight for his city, and the only way to be a good fighter is to get fit.

Sokrates admits, as many modern scholars do, that ""the city does not publicly train for war"" (3.12.5). There was no group drill or military exercise for the Athenian hoplite militia. To make up for this shortcoming, Sokrates says, individual men like Epigenes ought to do all they can to make sure they are at least individually as fit as they can be, so that they won't let their community down or get a reputation for cowardice. All the other benefits of physical fitness listed by Sokrates (3.12.6-8) are just a bonus.

This argument ties into two strands of Classical Greek thought. The first and older of the two is the ideal that the elite, having the leisure to do whatever they want, ought to use their time to be the best possible people. They should sharpen their minds to become better shepherds to their fellow man, and improve their bodies so they will be better protectors of their community. These ideals have their most competitive product in the Games held throughout the Greek world, with the Olympics being the most famous. In their desire to be the best at paramilitary activities like javelin throwing, wrestling or running in armour, athletes at the Olympics were simply taking an old leisure-class ideal to an extreme.

In practice, however, most of the rich couldn't be bothered. Having a perfect physique took a lot of hard work that could also be spent hunting or drinking or reading or sleeping with prostitutes. Many among the elite fell short of their ideal of being *kaloikagathoi*, the beautiful and good, who earned their high status by being literally better than others. Both Xenophon and Plato complain about the ""fat rich men"" who live their lives in the shade and aren't worth much when called upon to fight for their city. Instead of exemplars for the common folk, they are the subject of derision - the pasty white, flabby, gormless rich who wouldn't know which end of a spear to stick in the bad guys. This is why Sokrates in this dialogue (3.12.2) stresses that Epigenes ought to train so that people won't think he's a coward.

The second strand is the notion that Greek armies really ought to do more training. All sources suggest that they generally received none, and Xenophon and Plato in particular are extremely vocal in their disappointment about this. Both advocate more comprehensive state-funded training programmes. Both also advocate similar methods to be used by armies on campaign. In Xenophon's case, this probably derives from his own experience as a mercenary and his observations when he was living with the Spartans. For Plato, however, it simply fits into the general philosophical trend of the later 5th and particularly the 4th century, to regard all areas of expertise as teachable, including martial prowess. In this new way of thinking, armies didn't just fight with innate skill or courage, but could be taught to fight better. They needed to be trained, both in collective drill and mock combat, and in weapon proficiency. Since no Greek state went very far in bringing this into practice even in the later 4th century BC, Xenophon and Plato could do nothing but describe the superior condition and military abilities of those who *did* train (the Spartans, and the Guardians of Plato's ideal city-state, respectively), and encourage individual members of the leisure class to do themselves and the state a favour by setting the right example. This is what Sokrates is made to say (3.12.5):

> I tell you, just because the city does not publicly train for war, you must not make that an excuse for being any less careful in attending to it yourself.

With this context in mind, is it likely that Sokrates held these views and practiced what he preached? As a contemporary of the sophists, who were the first to argue that anything could be taught, it is possible that Sokrates already believed in the merits of military training. However, the frustrations of Xenophon and Plato, and their hammering on about training as a result, belongs to the 4th century BC. The specific reference to a lack of proper state-funded training, and the complaint about rich citizens who choose to be weak and lazy, shows that Xenophon is using Sokrates here as an authoritative mouthpiece for his solutions to problems he saw in his own time. There is little to suggest that there was a debate on the merits of military training in Sokrates' day, so it's not very likely that Xenophon was representing the actual words of Sokrates.

As to whether Sokrates himself was in shape, there isn't much to go on. Xenophon insists that he was fond of dancing, which may have kept him spritely even in old age - but dancing is often promoted as another way to stay fit and agile for battle. Perhaps this is yet another intrusion of Xenophon's own obsession with the need to prepare for war. 

We do know from Xenophon and Plato that Sokrates - being a member of the leisure class himself - saw extensive military service. He served at the siege of Potidaia (432-430 BC), at Delion (424 BC) and at Amphipolis (422 BC), earning a reputation for level-headedness, courage, and indifference to hardship. But there is nothing to suggest that he was fit. The army certainly wouldn't have trained him, since, as noted above, Greek armies didn't train. Some armies held athletic competitions while on campaign, to improve the overall fitness of the troops by invoking their competitive instincts, but there's no evidence that the Athenians at Potidaia did this. No part of Sokrates' typical description suggests he was muscled; instead, he is described as pot-bellied and ugly and dirty. His hardiness on campaign wasn't meant to show his embodiment of the old leisure-class ideal of the perfect man, but to prove his credentials as a perfect *philosopher*: putting mind above matter, he had become completely indifferent to the sufferings of his body, allowing it to go without warmth or food at will. It seems highly unlikely that such a man, if Sokrates was really like this, could have maintained a perfect physique."
994,AskHistorians,Why did the Soviets continue suffering high casualties in 1944 and 1945?,"As the number of upvotes suggests, this is a very interesting question and one without a cut and dry answer. The simple, almost cop-out answer is that for 1944 and 1945 the Soviets were on the offensive, and casualty ratios often skew in the defender's favor. However, this doesn't really do the topic justice. Before diving in, I will throw the caveat that TiK is not a historian and should probably be trusted about as far as you can throw him. He pulls from good sources, most of the time, but I've noticed that his videos are very much ""I am regurgitating whatever the most recent book I read said"" and he's a bit of a nutter anyhow.

So, how do we explain the disparity in casualties during the third period of the war? Some of it is indeed reporting disparities: the Soviets and the Wehrmacht seem to have accounted for wounded in action differently, and German wounded-in-action numbers will vary somewhat depending on whether you're going from Wehrmacht or Heeresarzt (military medical service) records. The Heeresarzt numbers are known to lag somewhat, so it is possible (although difficult to confirm) that there is a 'tail' of a couple of weeks between the end of a battle and when all the casualties from a battle are tabulated.^(1) This would lead to some funny casualty ratios depending on how the Wikipedia editors define the end of the battle. It is notable that the linked articles are generally comparing the raw Wehrmacht and/or Heeresarzt data to the studies done by Krivosheev on Red Army casualties. There may be a sort of apples and oranges comparison happening here, where Krivosheev is tabulating perhaps 60 days worth of casualties while the wiki editors are tabulating 50 days worth, depending on definitions of the start and end of the battle. [This is something I've run into recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fxi5go/the_battle_of_stalingrad_a_grand_german_success/fmvbu25/?context=3) with casualty figures at Stalingrad, for instance. I don't have a copy of Krivosheev's *Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses in the Twentieth Century* at hand to confirm this definitions question, unfortunately.

There is also the matter of figuring out how each side counted their casualties - all wounded counts are not created equal. For starters, I am having trouble determining thus far how complete the Heeresarzt numbers are. Namely, soldiers who were lightly wounded and were treated at their position or in a *Verwundetennest* (a casualty collection point in American parlance) by a field medic, but did not require treatment at the *Truppenverbandplatz* (battalion aid station) - would they be reported in any official capacity? My *guess* is that in the late stages of the war in particular, as the availability of trained medical personnel as well as supplies and casualty transport infrastructure worsened, only more severe injuries would be prioritized for treatment at rear facilities. If a casualty never made it to the *Truppenverbandplatz*, then it would likely be up to his chain of command as to whether he was reported or not; this introduces inconsistencies. **However**, I must emphasize that this is a conclusion I arrive at myself based largely on the description of Wehrmacht medical care in the US Army Office of Medical History's [official report](https://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/medsvcsinmedtrnmnrthrtrs/appendices/appd.htm), and I really hope one of this sub's Wehrmacht experts can point me in the direction of a more comprehensive source. What I can say with somewhat more certainty is that, by 1944-45, the Soviet field medical system was much more mature than it was at the beginning of the war. By 1943, there were designated medical squads at company level, responsible for evacuation of casualties to higher care echelons - not too different from the Wehrmacht.^(2) However, while the Wehrmacht's logistical situation was getting worse during the late war, the Red Army's situation was improving, and there was within the GVSU (the Red Army medical branch) a real drive to keep accurate statistics & meet official goals. Efforts were made to involve the GVSU in planning major operations, and from late 1943 onward there were more orderlies & auxiliary orderlies allocated in each rifle division, which would increase the ability of the division to transport casualties to aid stations.^(3) From all this - especially the Soviet military's predilection for getting and using as much statistical data as possible in the planning process - it is reasonable to infer that the Red Army was **probably** reporting more accurate numbers for wounded-in-action than the Wehrmacht by late 1944.

So, alright. We've hemmed and hawed a bit about whether the Wikipedia casualty ratios are a good comparison, but at the end of the day it is quite clear that no matter what the exact numbers are, the Soviets did often suffer worse casualties in 1944-45 than the Wehrmacht did. What might this tell us about the relative 'combat effectiveness' of the two armies? Fortunately, someone has already done the math for me on this one. [These two](https://i.imgur.com/vzzSK4N.png) [tables](https://i.imgur.com/S0RMh3H.png) show us the relative combat effectiveness of the Soviet attackers and the Wehrmacht defenders.^(4) This chart shows us some *really* interesting information. First and foremost, although the raw-number casualty ratios look very lopsided in favor of the Germans, the casualty ratios *as a portion of each side's manpower* are actually not very favorable for the Germans at all! In one battle within the larger Dnepr-Carpathians Operation which you cite, despite the fact that the Soviets took more casualties than the Germans in raw numbers, as proportions of the overall force the Soviets take 34% casualties (all types - KIA, WIA, MIA) while the Wehrmacht takes 55% overall casualties. How can this be? Well, as much as the trope of Russian numerical superiority is much overplayed, the simple fact is that by 1944 the Soviets are making their major strategic offensives with more men concentrated on that one operation than the Germans have on the defense. I will address this in more depth later, but this is a cornerstone of Soviet doctrine. For the German defenders, this is a comparatively target-rich environment. In other words, even though the proportional casualty ratios are often in favor of the Soviets here, the fact that there are more Soviet soldiers on the battlefield means that more of them will become casualties in total, *especially* when looking at the 'efficiency' advantage for the defender.

995,AskHistorians,What were the arguments and how fierce/widespread was the resistance against creating Social Security before it was passed?,"Since no one has chimed in, I'll drop my sea services cover and put my Americanist cap back on.  A short answer is not one that most people nowadays would expect, since the biggest issue wasn't if something would get passed but rather what type of bill was going to be enacted, and the most interesting part of the story is what was the most popular alternative at the time.

The behind the scenes drafting process of the Social Security bill is something that we know a lot about largely because the head staffer for FDR's committee on the subject, a Wisconsin economics professor named Ed Witte, kept an extremely thorough diary in 1934 and 1935 that was published posthumously in the 1960s as a book, *The Development of the Social Security Act*.

Witte knew Frances Perkins and had experience in social welfare legislation on the state level, and thus was her first choice to come up with something that had prevented other versions from being enacted previously: what was going to be included and more importantly, how on earth was it going to be funded?  Wagner-Lewis, a relatively popular unemployment insurance bill, had died in committee in 1934 once FDR went lukewarm on it once he was alerted to the fact that it'd likely require $20 billion in reserves and cause a massive deflationary hit.  Unlike most New Deal legislation - especially that which passed in the 100 Days - this wasn't something that could be put together with broad strokes while expecting the executive branch to subsequently figure out how to implement detailed policy down the road.

FDR being FDR, though, politics were just as important.  The other major factor in the timing was to counteract even more radical proposals - Huey Long (who FDR had long considered the most dangerous man in America, with MacArthur ranking second) had by then soured on the New Deal and come up with the ""Share Our Wealth"" redistribution program which included aspects of a social safety net along with expropriation, and Father Coughlin had suggested things like income guarantees along with nationalizing industries.  This was one of several reasons why FDR delayed any action until after the 1934 elections, since by floating a generic proposal in July 1934 but not actually providing specifics until presenting it to Congress until January 1935 he rather disarmed both Long and Coughlin in the meantime with a very gauzy target, and as it turned out FDR's hand was strengthened even further by one of the few times in history where midterms produced substantial gains for the incumbent's party.

It's also interesting to note that even at the peak of his political strength, FDR still took his usual wily approach to not spend any more political capital than he was forced to: an advisory committee was set up with members who ranged from mildly to outright non-partisan (UNC's President chaired it), it was regionally and politically balanced, and most importantly it consisted of people who generally were neither politicians nor particularly interested in attending tedious meetings in Washington.  This meant Witte and a few other staffers were largely free to come up with a plan without much interference and report back to the two cabinet level officers that mattered who were running the committee proper - Frances Perkins and Harry Hopkins, in that order - along with the nominal advisory committee providing significant political cover for everyone involved once the principals had made a decision on how to proceed.

But where the political angle gets really interesting was with one of those total wildcard oddball personas that periodically emerge in American political history: Francis Townshend.

Townshend spent his twenties trying and failing at all sorts of things - ranch hand, teacher, homesteader, miner, stove salesman - went to medical school at 31 (which he paid for with a paper route), got converted to socialism while getting his MD, and then spent the next 30 years eeking out a living doing marginal doctoring while still trying and failing at other ventures (a dry ice factory, and selling real estate in California.)  At 66, he had been Long Beach's public health officer until after an election the city council membership changed and fired him in June 1933, a perfectly lovely time to find oneself elderly and unemployed.

While it's still not clear precisely where he came up with the ideas, his unintended sabbatical gave him plenty of time to ponder the issues of the day, and in September he wrote a legendary letter to the editor in which he proposed a solution.  From Amenta's *When Movements Matter*:

>Townshend saw poverty among the aged and declared it unjust that the people who built the country's prosperity were so insecure in their final years.  He had a simple prescription - to give them cash.  The $150 per month guaranteed pension, far more than the median family income of the day, would empty the poorhouses where in California alone approximately 5,000 of the aged were institutionalized in 1929.  The high pension would also end any dependency of older Americans on their children, elevate the status of the aged, and validate their lives...(T)hat fall Townshend moved to press his plan beyond the editorial pages, having material printed up and gathering some volunteers to help distribute it, solicit contributions, and gain signatures on petitions in support.

This caught the attention of his old real estate boss, a gentleman by the name of Earl Clements, who realized that California non-profit law actually allowed nonprofits to turn profits as long as those were 'incidental to its main activities', which then led to the incorporation of Old Age Revolving Pensions, Ltd in January 1934.  The primary purpose of this was, of course, to lobby for the Townshend Plan (now boosted to $200 per month, or over $40,000 per year in today's money), but its incidental one was was to sell pamphlets, form regional Townshend clubs to lobby (at $25 per charter), split revenues with local officers (which is why the charters were valuable), and otherwise provide a way to pay the founders $50 a week (eventually $100) above their expense allowance.

In other words, one of the more significant political movements of the Great Depression was more or less a MLM scheme which provided the founders with 2.5 cents per member and 1 cent per pamphlet.

Now, not everyone involved was in it for the money and some aspects of the plan were pretty interesting - Townshend had a vision in which Americans were forced to retire at 60 in order to clear out jobs for younger people, for instance, something that has had echoes down the years - but the financing of this was a pipe dream at best.  Originally, it was supposed to be paid for with a 10% national sales tax, but when they actually ran the numbers they realized it might have to be closer to 50% to accomplish their goals.  In response, that proposal was then replaced by a 2% 'business transaction tax' - more or less a VAT that would have even been far more difficult to implement since it more or less was a 2% sales tax every time an item passed up a level of consumption, but it at least satisfied the goal of obfuscating just how unrealistic the numbers were.

However, the several hundred thousand Townshend club members and million petition signers (Townshend claimed 15 million) demanding their $200 a month still struck a chord and were perceived far differently than Coughlin and Long.  From Jean Edward Smith:

>""The Townsend Plan was far from radical. It appealed to heavily Protestant rural America, proclaimed traditional values, and promised to preserve the profit system free from alien collectivism, socialism, and godless communism. As Townsend put it, the movement embraced people “who believe in the Bible, believe in God, cheer when the flag passes by, the Bible Belt solid Americans.” It was a movement FDR dared not ignore.""

So while there was some opposition by the business community - Alfred Sloan, chairman of General Motors, was vehemently opposed, and about half of the Republicans left in both houses voted against the bill in committee before capitulating when it came to the floor - this was the main source of the opposition: that the plans being proposed in Congress weren't generous enough, and Witte notes that while the Townshend plan was viewed as ridiculous by the vast majority of members, the sheer volume of communications received about it from constituents proved to be a fairly serious issue in the House.  However, with a couple of things stripped (mandating industrial pensions, which large businesses opposed, and health insurance, for which Perkins states that the American Medical Association would have tried to kill the bill if it had been included) the resulting bill passed the House in a 371-33 landslide and the Senate 77-6, and post-conference it passed via unanimous consent.

I won't go into details about Witte's solution on how to pay for it, but it was relatively ingenious and met FDR's demand that the plan would be self funding through 1980 - which it actually was.  What no one anticipated was that Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, would try to run for President in 1972 and use his position to force the House to pass automatic cost of living adjustments for Social Security to fuel his campaign, which is how the books got so out of balance.  Mills got precisely nowhere in the primaries, of course, but there's some irony in that one of the most powerful members of Congress for several decades is now almost entirely forgotten, with what little he's remembered for being this bit of fiscal skulduggery - along with his legendary 1974 romp with a stripper that ended up with a dip in the Tidal Pool.

996,AskHistorians,Did George Washington ever comment on the fact that immediately after his presidency the U.S. government split into two parties?,"Sure, yes. The first party system was starting to form in 1792–93, during his first term as president. He was very cognizant of this. Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, two leaders of opposite parties, were famously rival forces within Washington's cabinet. 

Washington professed to despise parties or factionalism. He [wrote](http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-24-02-0300) to Jefferson in 1792:

> ""How unfortunate, and how much is it to be regretted then, that whilst we are encompassed on all sides with avowed enemies and insidious friends, that internal dissentions should be harrowing and tearing our vitals. The last, to me, is the most serious—the most alarming—and the most afflicting of the two. And without more charity for the opinions and acts of one another in Governmental matters, or some more infalible criterion by which the truth of speculative opinions, before they have undergone the test of experience, are to be forejudged than has yet fallen to the lot of fallibility, I believe it will be difficult, if not impracticable, to manage the Reins of Government or to keep the parts of it together: for if, instead of laying our shoulders to the machine after measures are decided on, one pulls this way and another that, before the utility of the thing is fairly tried, it must inevitably be torn asunder—And, in my opinion the fairest prospect of happiness and prosperity that ever was presented to man, will be lost—perhaps for ever!""

> My earnest wish, and my fondest hope therefore is, that instead of wounding suspicions, and irritable charges, there may be liberal allowances—mutual forbearances-and temporising yieldings on all sides. Under the exercise of these, matters will go on smoothly, and, if possible, more prosperously. Without them every thing must rub, the wheels of Government will clog—our enemies will triumph—and by throwing their weight into the disaffected Scale, may accomplish the Ruin of the goodly fabric we have been erecting.

Three days later, Washington wrote a very similar [letter](http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-12-02-0206) to Hamilton that echoed some of the sentiments and language of the letter to Jefferson:

> How unfortunate would it be, if a fabric so goodly—erected under so many Providential circumstances—and in its first stages, having acquired such respectibility, should, from diversity of Sentiments, or internal obstructions to some of the acts of Government (for I cannot prevail on myself to believe that these measures are, as yet, the deliberate acts of a determined party) should be harrowing our vitals in such a manner as to have brought us to the verge of dissolution. Melancholy thought! But one, at the same time that it shows the consequences of diversified opinions, when pushed with too much tenacity; exhibits evidence also of the necessity of accommodation; and of the propriety of adopting such healing measures as will restore harmony to the discordant members of the Union, & the governing powers of it.

By 1795, as partisanship grew increasingly intense, Washington again [lamented](http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-18-02-0299) parties in a letter to Timothy Pickering.

> But (much indeed to be regretted!) party disputes are now carried to that length, and truth is so enveloped in mist, and false representation that it is extremely difficult to know through what channel to seek it. This difficulty to one, who is of no party, & whose sole wish is to pursue, with undeviating steps a path which would lead this Country to respectability, wealth & happiness is exceedingly to be lamented.

Washington may have disliked the idea of factionalism, but in most ways he governed as a Federalist. In fact, most historians consider him a Federalist. During the 1790s, there were no formal party mechanisms. People didn't register as Federalists. Instead, belonging in a ""party"" was defined by behavior and identity. 

To be sure, Washington resisted the label of being a ""Federalist."" Indeed, many Federalists of the time attempted to describe their rivals, the Republicans, as a self-interested party while claiming that they alone represented the true interest of society. In this schema, there was one group (Federalists) acting in the interests of the nation, and a party (the Republicans) acting out of self-interest. Through this rhetorical move, they could claim to be opposed to partisanship even as they acted very much like partisans. I don't know if Washington ever used this same rhetoric. It doesn't really sound like him. But I wouldn't be surprised if he was somewhat sympathetic to the ideas. "
997,AskHistorians,"Tlingit Native Americans had more advanced technology and craft including permanent structures, metal armor and, arguably, swords. Normally such a group builds a powerful kingdom over their neighbors. Are there any reasons why they never felt the need to expand, despite their advancements?","Establishing something that is heavily glossed over by the question: The Tlingit aren't the only ones to have the things OP listed in the Northwest Coast. 

They were not the only ones to use rod and slat armor, use pieces of steel from shipwrecks that washed up onto the beach as raw material for weapons, build forts, form intricate artwork, build canoes, and form a societal structure of slaves, aristocrats, and commoners.

All of that is present from the Copper River in Alaska to the Columbia River separating Washington and Oregon.

Just to preface this, I mainly specialize in Southern Coast (Southern BC/Western WA) Warfare, but many of the sources that cover warfare along the Northwest Coast also extensively cover Northern Coast groups such as the Tlingit.

The Haida and the Tsimshian have pretty much the same sort of armor and weapons that the Tlingit carried and produced. They lived in more or less the same style of longhouses, formed similar villages, produced formline artwork, totem poles, and crafted the same sort of canoes. They had similar societal structures and in fact were essential trading partners with the Tlingit. While the Tsimshianic and Haida languages are unrelated to Tlingit, their cultures are close enough for those just learning about Northwest Coast cultures to conflate them. 

Groups south of the Haida/Tlingit/Tsimshian such as the Coast Salishan tribes, the Nuu-chah-nulth, and Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw among others had generally similar societies (slave, commoner, noble) and technologies, and were no less capable at warfare. 

Rod and slat armor are still prevalent along with reinforced hide cuirasses (the most common form of armor along the Northwest Coast. Layered corselets largely of elk or moose hide, quite effective at repelling piercing weapons), Vancouver Island had cedar bark rope curiasses, et al. Copper and scavenged steel were also used pre-contact for manufacturing weapons like daggers and short swords, they crafted similar bows, constructed weapons of hard stone such as granite and jade, ground blades of slate or flintknapped chert, and carved large canoes of cedar. Wars were waged over wrongs, feuds, slaves, and goods. Variation is present of course along the coast (for example, rod and slat armor is less common in the Puget Sound), but not to such an extent that you would hands down expect a flatout victory in battle among say Nuu-chah-nulth and Haida with both sides aware and prepared for the other's presence.


It is also not as if the Tlingit/Tsimshian/Haida never came into conflict with tribes outside their immediate area either.
For example, the tribes of the Puget Sound would form an alliance if Northern Raiders such as the Tlingit came into the Sound in force. Northern Style canoes like the ones you have linked would then be surrounded by usually smaller yet more maneuverable canoes endemic to the area, filled with warriors that have the intention of sinking the marauding canoe with large sling stones and sizable rocks targeting the regions where the bow of the canoe connects according to accounts recorded by Marian Smith, Jay Miller, and Myron Ells. If this broke off or was chipped away enough, the impressively armored Northerners would then drown in the middle of the Sound, or be speared to death.

A similar response after contact also including Puget Sound Indians is the largely Coast Salish response to increased Lekwiltok raids at Maple Bay. Tribes that were formed of mostly autonomous villages had formed an alliance to a foe that repeatedly terrorized them and ended the threat once and for all on the waters of Maple Bay in Vancouver Island. So it is not as if the tribes of the Salish Sea were incapable of an organized response to serious threats from the North.

Thus, when taking into account that tribes along the Northwest Coast largely had similar arms, armor, forms of transportation, strongholds, tactics, formed alliances to aid them in war, and that these groups didn't live in isolation from each other for centuries...the Tlingit not forming a grand empire isn't very perplexing."
998,AskHistorians,Why did the Southern United States become more religious than the Northern United States?,"There’s an old post by /u/tayaravaknin (who since deleted his account) that answered:

 * [How did the Bible Belt become the Bible Belt?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2dx803/how_did_the_bible_belt_become_the_bible_belt/)

It’s, I think, a good but incomplete picture. It doesn’t explain things that I’d like it to explain. 

It mentions fundamentalists, but doesn’t plumb the [Fundamentalist/Modernist split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist–Modernist_Controversy). This was one rupture, long brewing, that put the Northeast and the South on different trajectories. Boston, for example, was [notoriously prudish for much of the 19th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banned_in_Boston). 

It also doesn’t go into the relationship between religion and race—*The Civil War as a theological crisis* by Mark Noll is important in explaininga among other things the deep role that religion played in justifying (and opposing) Black chattel slavery. On the other side, Raboteau’s *Slave Religion*, which gave us the idea of the Black Church as the “invisible institution” undergirding much of African-American life from Slavery to Civil Rights, is also key to understanding religion in the South (we often think of “the South” as “White people in the South”, but obviously that’s not the case. Pretty much the whole South is 10-35% Black today, and before the Great Migration, the [numbers were signifantly higher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_African-American_population)). Just as religion was key for providing parts of the language for the moral justification of slavery, it similarly provided the language for the moral justification of Jim Crow and segregation (though I don’t know as clear a book on that). Now, obviously, religion has little to do with racial caste systems, but it does give language and form to other moral systems. 

One thing that sociologists have been arguing since the 80’s (Wuthnow’s *Restructuring of American Religion*) is that while religion was once largely divided by sect (especially Protestant, Catholic, Jew, but also the various Protestant denominations) are increasingly divided by attitudes towards religion.  Orthodox Jews, Southern Baptists, and Conservative Catholics increasingly make common cause, just as Reform Jews, members of the United Church of Christ, and Liberal Catholics do (many Protestant demoninations, like Methodists, Lutherans, and Episcopalians are very divided between conservative and liberal factions). It’s wrong to say that political attitudes shape religious attitudes, but there’s certainly an interative interaction between the two that didn’t exist in the same way in the 1950’s. Though, a book I’m reading now, Schultz’s *Tri-Faith America* argues that the 1950’s was in many ways extra-ordinary in terms of religion, but it’s also worth remembering that before that period, religion was largely divided by Protestant vs. Catholic (vs. Jew) before any other division. Sure, there were flair ups like the Modernist/Fundamentalist Controversy, but the emergence/reemergence of Fundamentalist/Evangelical (not identical) Christianity as a major political force only since the 1980’s (Moral Majority was Founded in 1979) has a strong effect on contemporary perceptions of the South. I like Casanova’s *Public Religion in the Modern World’s* chapter on America for explaining this. One aspect of this, some demographers argue and I believe, is that this powerful conservative Christianity has seemingly led many liberals to say something along he lines of, “If this is religion, I want none of it.” Most of the post-1980 nationwide declines in religiosity have come among liberals. For a non-technical article on this, Claude Fisher’s article, “[Can Liberals Get a Witness?](http://bostonreview.net/made-america/claude-fischer-can-liberals-get-witness)” in the *Boston Review* is good. I think there has been a similar push for political conservatives to become increasingly religious conservatives. But the point is that politics and religion don’t exist walled off from each other; they’re mutually constitutive. 

One big thing that I think matters but is hard to quantify or approach systematically is the effects of Catholic immigration. If you look at [a map of Catholics in the US](http://www.adherents.com/maps/map_us_romcath.jpg), you’ll see the non-Louisiana South and Mormon-majority Utah are the two places with lowest proportion of Catholics. I personally think that the number of Catholics (that is, heterogeneity) has an effect on the later character of Protestantism in the region, as we move through the 1930’s and especially into the Post-War era, brotherhood and religious tolerance (for Protestants, Catholics, and Jews) has a signicant effect. I would guess, without hard numbers, that areas that were less religiously diverse were less affected by these significant changes (remember, religion helped sink Al Smith’s presidential chances, and there were serious worries that Kennedy’s Catholicism would hurt him—though I should point out that the stress solidly Democratic South was actually the only region to vote for the Democrat Smith). This part is speculative but I think significant. Notice how much the South stands out [on this map](https://images.flatworldknowledge.com/berglee/berglee-fig04_019.jpg) for their lack of any areas (outside of Louisiana and South Florida and South Texas) with large amounts of Catholics. 

Lastly, I think if we go back to the beginning of the Republic, there were significant differences in how the Northeast was founded, and what people came there, compared with the South. That’s not controversial, but how exactly these effects carry across two or three centuries is inherently harder to argue. It’s the kind of thing people are explicitly taught not to do in graduate school, I feel. The best book making this argument is certainly *Albion’s Seed*. In his view the South was founded by conservative Episcopalian “Cavaliers” and revival-prone “Borderers” while the Northeast was deeply influenced, and culturally shaped by, Puritans and Quakers. For a deeper summary/review of *Albion’s Seed*, see [this entry from the blog Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/27/book-review-albions-seed/). This thesis I think removes a lot of important contingencies (there’s no particularly reason why the Northeast became more religiously liberal and the South became more religiously conservative), but it does give an important piece of the puzzle of varying regional American cultures. 

One really last thing to consider is that social desirability bias probably push both regions’ of answers in opposite directions. Americans, for example, tend to overreport their church attendance in retrospective surveys (how often do you go to church?) compared to time use surveys (list everything you did by the hour). This is not true of Europe, as far as I can remember (Jose Casanova wrote about this somewhere, but not in his big book). Self-reported religiosity is in many ways aspirational, and other measures, like religious knowledge, holding to religious rules, or the participation in religious events, will certainly show the same differences but maybe less starkly (I’m not sure about this, but again I suspect it).  

Ultimately, this is longer than I meant it to be. I meant it just to be a quick note to the original linked answer. But I wasn’t satisfied with that answer and I’m not satisfied with this answer. There is not a single clear answer, or even a set of separate but mutual reinforcing theories that I’m aware of. Compare that to the literature comparing [religiosity in the US and Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/19isi7/why_did_europe_become_less_religious_over_time/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit), where I think you can get three or four theories that all explain big parts of it. Some of these theories, I should add, can be used to explain the Southern/Northern differences. Most obviously the theory of religious economies (Finke wrote a lot about this in the specifically American context) about how competition between Protestant sects drove religiosity, but what it means to “be a good American” to, say, the modal Alabaman might imply a rather different religious identity (“our shared Judeo-Christian values”) from the modal New Yorker, where “being a good American” might not imply a religious identity at all (beyond some sort of “tolerance for religious differences”). Which is to say, when we add what we know about international comparisons to this comparison, we get another set of theories entirely that also seem to have explanatory value.

Which is all to say, this is very complicated question without one (or even three or four) satisfying answers. Four years later, I’m still pretty satisfied with that Europe vs. America religiosity answer I gave, and I don’t think I’ll every really be satisfied with a why is the South more religious than the Northeast answer.

999,AskScienceFiction,[MCU] Does Doctor Strange remember all the times Dormammu killed him in the Dark Dimension?,"Yes. This is part of the reason he's so much more powerful in *Infinity War*; he had a long, long time to practice battle magics while he was bargaining with Dormammu.

The fact that he will remember each death is implied in their dialog. Dormammu says that he will kill Strange over and over again, to which Strange replies ""pain is an old friend."" Strange knows that he's going to suffer greatly, but he's used to suffering greatly.

You can also read into the tone in his voice. He starts out strong and commanding, but toward the end of the sequence, he's becoming playful. Strange is basically saying ""hey Dormammu, remember me from five seconds ago? Still here. Wanna do this again? Okay, cool. I've got nowhere to be."""

You'll likely go to jail, sure, but the second you put ""Was likely manipulated by another supervillain"" you are likely to get a pretty soft sentence.   


Now... Green Goblin or Doc Ock are likely to go along with this, because they are ego-driven jerks who will gladly take the credit for defeating their long time foe. The only real problem here is that if they don't go along with it, you're screwed.

>'Actually, they're not shooting stars at all,' said Mr Wonka. 'They're Shooting Knids. They're Knids trying to enter the Earth's atmosphere at high speed and going up in flames.'

The only way I can think that Wonka could know about the Vermicious Knids is if he's been to other planets. That makes the Oompa-Loompas aliens (but very nice ones).

When Mrs Salt interrupts, Wonka decides to skip the whole ""I've been to another planet"" thing because she's acting so high and mighty. Rather than insult her, he roped her into the conversation as a co-conspirator, and did it in such a way that she'd look more the fool for continuing to protest. After all, who are the rest of the guests going to believe: a geography teacher, or their own eyes?

Anyway, to answer your question: this is far and away outside the jurisdiction of the United Nations. There is a Universal Charter of Human Rights, but this depends largely on the definition of not only ""Universal,"" but also ""Human."" Is an Oompa-Loompa human? They might be insulted if you were to say ""yes."" Especially after the examples they've seen. And as for ""rights"" - well, as Mr Wonka might say, they have all of those, and their lefts, too, thank you very much."

1009,AskScienceFiction,"[DC] What if Kal-El's escape pod landed in the same spot in Kansas but much earlier, and is found in 1775 by members of the Comanche tribe? How does it change/affect history in North America and the world?","More Comanche bands were arriving every day, and every warrior among them knew the name of their band, the Quahadi, the Antelope-Eaters. Every Comanche had heard of the Quahadi’s new warband chief. He was young yet not even the oldest warrior would speak before him. His skin was white, but he had proved his loyalty to the Quahadi in raid after raid. Now every one of them looked to the young man for guidance, for wisdom, for strength. He was the greatest buffalo hunter, the greatest horseman, the strongest warrior. And his closest war-brothers knew he was also much more. His name was Pohebits-quasho, “Iron Jacket”, and the tales his war-brothers told of him left their listeners aghast. It was said that bullets bounced off his skin. It was said that he could blow bullets aside with his breath. 

As the warriors gathered Iron Jacket spoke, and the restlessness among them stilled immediately. He spoke with few words, but they were words that brought a great cheer to the listeners. The Comanche would ride this full moon, and Iron Jacket, if they wished, would lead them all. The representatives of the other bands spoke as one, and joined their voices to Iron Jacket’s war-brothers as they cheered him. In two night’s time, the moon would be full. And the Comanche would ride as one tribe.

The battle was over quickly. Iron Jacket rode at the head of the line of a thousand whooping warriors. The Mexican soldiers fired a single volley and fled. He led raids against their towns and villages. For an entire summer he looted and raided, taking hundreds of slaves, and burning thousands of homes. The Mexicans sent their best general against him, but the man returned, pale and ill, with only a handful of his men remaining. He said that Iron Jacket must be a supernatural being, for he had seen the Comanche chief shot dead centre without any harm coming to him. The Mexicans and Texans became terrified of Iron Jacket, and the Comanche became a name to be feared.

Iron Jacket knelt in the dirt as tears poured down his face. His wife and daughter lay under the Wichita mountains, and their belongings lay burning before him, the flames dancing on his tear-soaked face. The smallpox had taken them both, and devastated the Quahada. Barely half of them remained. The rest of the Comanche faced similar woe. Iron Jacket was devastated. He could not eat, he could not speak. His wife’s brother knelt beside him and slashed at his own arms in mourning, as was the custom, showing the depths of his grief. But Iron Jacket could not. His knife slid off his skin harmlessly like it always had. And his heart broke that he could not mourn his beloved wife properly. 

For many years Iron Jacket mourned. And despite their once invulnerability in battle, the Comanche way of life was steadily disrupted. Decimated by the Smallpox, and by the Cholera that followed it, their great warbands no longer rode out every full moon. Their villages became abandoned. Their enemies no longer shook with fear at their name. The buffalo herds were dying as white hunters took them, slaughtering them in greater and greater numbers. The Comanche had no farms, the buffalo were their life. And the white hunters, despite how many the Comanche killed, seemed never ending.

Iron Jacket remarried, and his second wife gave birth to a son. He became known as Lone Wanderer, due to the boy’s habit of disappearing for days on end. Only Iron Jacket knew where the boy went, and only he could follow him, though he never did, appreciating the child’s need for solitude. The burden of leadership weighed heavily on Iron Jacket these days, and he wished he too had a place of solitude to retreat to. But every day brought councils, debates, problems to fix. He could barely afford the time to eat, let alone take time out for himself. A war chief had to be visible at all times, and Iron Jacket was the war chief of war chiefs, the most famous Comanche alive.

The young warriors clamoured for Iron Jacket to gather the warbands again, as he had done before the great dying. He was reluctant, he was superstitious and feared that the death of his first wife was somehow tied to the lives he had taken. He did not know where his abilities came from, he did not know why he could not be touched by bullets or blades, why he seemed to have limitless strength, why the smallpox had not touched him, or why he could travel so far and so fast without exhaustion. His old war-brothers had respected him for his abilities, now he was revered. But he saw the faces of the dead whenever he closed his eyes, not just Comanche, but the white men also. Women and children falling apart in his hands like water. He could not sleep through the night any more. He did not want to go to war again. But his people needed him. And so he must.

The Comanche rode again, and these raids tore the Texan rangers and US army apart. They fell back in disarray, terrified of Iron Jacket, the legend that rode at the head of hundreds of screaming warriors. But though their bullets bounced off Iron Jacket, they did not bounce of his war-brothers. And every brother who lay beneath the mountains was one less brother to ride with them. 

The bands were weak, dying of diseases that Iron Jacket could not see or stop. Having to ride further and further apart, scattering themselves, to find the buffalo. Unable to sleep for the faces of the dead that broke apart and spilled through his hands each night, Iron Jacket ran beneath the moon, travelling vast distances in seconds, searching for the hunters who killed the buffalo. He killed them wherever he found them. But the next month as he searched, he found a village of Comanche instead. They lay slaughtered, fifty women, children, old people, all mutilated in the same way as he had mutilated the hunters. Iron Jacket could not look at them, he staggered away, aghast at the consequences of his actions. He should have known that brutality bred only brutality and war led only to war. 

The Comanche village was dead, and the soldiers walked among the corpses, checking that none survived. Captain Rip Ford stood beside his horse and watched them with an implacable, merciless eye. He cared nothing for these people. Whether they lived or died was nothing to him. But he had orders to take care of the problem and that was what he was going to do. These people understood nothing but killing. Well, they would see Rip Ford knew how to kill Indians. And this Iron Jacket was no different than other powerful chiefs. You never fought them directly if you could help it, you took out their heart first, their homes, their food, their lives. You broke them down until they welcomed death. 

The Tonkawan Indian that sat in front of Rip Ford had a vicious look to him. But to Rip Ford, they all looked like that. He eyed the man suspiciously. He said his name was Pockmark, and he was well-named, the pox had scarred him deeply. But he led a force of hundreds of Tonkawa warriors, and they hated the Comanche who had long raided their fellow Indians just as much as anyone else. More than this, Pockmark said he had a way to kill Iron Jacket. Rip Ford was interested.

Iron Jacket sat, silently, in his hut. His war-brothers sat outside, fearful, worried. They had brought their great chief the news of the approaching army, that it had massacred the village a day’s journey down the river. But Iron Jacket hadn’t even replied. He had just gone into his hut and sat. He had barely moved since his son had left the last time and not returned. Lone Wanderer was gone, perhaps for ever. They had argued before he went, Lone Wanderer had said that this was not why they had their abilities, this brutal, bloody war. This endless killing. He had refused to be a part of it any more. Iron Jacket had not spoken a word since he left. He had no one left to comfort him. His war-brothers were young, his old companions long dead in raids and illness. His second wife was also dead now from a bout of measles which had torn through their band and left them a shadow of its former self.

The White men and their Tonkawan allies lined up outside Iron Jacket’s village. For the last time Iron Jacket mounted his horse, still leaping into the saddle in a single bound as he had done as a youth. But his face was weary, his eyes hooded, and his mouth heavily drawn. His last war-brothers lined up beside him. Many had come from the Comanche bands nearby. The name of Iron Jacket could still raise an army. He rode out alone to the lines of soldiers. He saw their captain, a hard-faced man with cold eyes. He fixed him with a stare that threatened to burn the man alive where he sat. But he could not do it this time, he could not face more death. Iron Jacket rode up and down the lines of soldiers, as they fired at him, their bullets bouncing off his skin as they had always done. He could at least do this, he could at least give his brothers courage. 

Pockmark grinned without humour as he pulled the oilcloth off his great buffalo gun. He raised it up, already loaded. He had bought the sliver of green rock from an old medicine man for a great price, more than he could afford. But if it worked it would be worth it. His own family were dead at the hands of this monster. Pockmark would avenge them, he would not falter. With a cry of rage he fired. The great Iron Jacket turned in his saddle at the cry, for an instant he looked straight at Pockmark, seeing the gun in his hands. But he did not move, or dodge the shot. He sat there, and shook in his seat as the green stone tore his iron skin open. As he slumped to the side and fell from his saddle his brothers cried out in horror. Rip Ford did not even smile as he raised his sabre at the lines of Indians before him. “Kill them all”, he said.

And what about other countries - does the Mexico MIB have an Agent Ñ?","There are 26 *high level* agents, each with a single letter code name.  These are the agents with a large amount of autonomy and respect, the best of the best.  They are the ones that get the ""world is about to end"" missions.  A single letter agent can grab any other agent and order him to fetch a glass of chocolate milk and it would happen no question.  Then there are up to 676 secondary agents with double letter codes.  They're the ones who deal with an alien that needs to be served a fine for an expired human suit, or other non-emergency grunt work.  Double letter agents will occasionally get teamed up with single letter agents.  This is a sign that they may be being groomed for higher levels, and when a single letter agent retires or is killed this is the pool they pull the replacement from.  Contrary, a double letter may often get assigned slime vacuum duty or sitting at a desk at intake customs.  This is a sign they're going nowhere.

There was an agent that was recruited directly to single letter status, without having to put in the time as double letter, but that was a unique case and the agent that recruited him was the most respected agent ever so had a lot of leeway.

The MiB division that operates out of America was the first and set many of the precedents, so generally other countries follow their lead and stick to 26 letters from the English alphabet, though that's not always the case.  For example, MiB Russia has 32 single letter agents with Cyrillic letter names.  MiB China has 25 single letter agents with pinyin characters, though there are grumblings at the ""Westernization"" of their agency.

1019,AskScienceFiction,[DC] Why does Catwoman take her cat theme so seriously?,In one word: BRANDING
1020,AskScienceFiction,[Star Wars] Was Anakin ever truly a hero or just a selfish asshole that happened to be on Team Good because they found him first?,"I don't think it's that simple.

Anakin was the son of a single mother who never knew a father (or had a father figure) and was chattel - he was a slave without rights and whose future was bereft of dignity or hope. One day a magical supermonk tells him he's special, and he's thrown into this galactic conflict he knows basically nothing about - he's still just as a kid.
The supermonk's sidekick decides that after gaining his freedom, Anakin should join a special boarding school to learn magic. So far in the story, he's been given very little choice in any life decisions

He grows up indoctrinated into this religion of supermonks, and often finds himself in life-threatening situations, all while being told (in hushed tones) that he's the Chosen One. The years go by, he grows up, and the psychological trauma of his routine near-death experiences combined with the transition from slave to Chosen One are beginning to take their toll - he wants to do what *he* wants, for a change. 

Suddenly, he falls in love - head over heels - with an older woman with a burgeoning political career, and he realizes it's forbidden by his teachers, friends, and colleagues. This is a critical moment -- as a slave he could not make decisions for himself,  then as a Padawan he could not make decisions for himself, and now as a Jedi Knight he's told he cannot make *certain* decisions for himself. 

Then, his mother dies in a cruel and horrible manner. The murder of the Tusken Raiders is more than just an emotional response of a grieving soldier, it's also the culmination of years of frustration, anger, and confusion, combined with poor mental health and a lack of proper discipline. He's not *evil*, but he's certainly not good, either. He's flawed, like everyone else. Only in his line of work, he's not allowed to be flawed. That kind of pressure takes its toll, and the death of his mother broke him, mentally and emotionally.

Anakin tells himself it's not fair, and comes to realize *life* in the galaxy isn't fair. Despite his abilities, his fame, his prowess, and his skill, he is denied fundamental access to life's joys - a wife, a mother, a family. Everyone in his life has basically told him that, no, he can't do as he pleases. He is not free. He cannot do or have certain things. And, like a petulant child, he instantly rebels by marrying the woman he loves in secret. He forms an intimate, emotional bond to help him cope.

Then, a galactic war breaks out, putting his life in constant danger. His new wife is being put in danger as well. He desperately wants to control the situation. Wants to protect her, and himself, in the vain hope that one day, when it's all over, they can be free together. She falls pregnant, and he is elated. But in his mind, the risk has now grown, too. He has so much to lose, having gained so much since his early life as a child slave on a backwater planet.

A powerful man and potential father figure steps into the scene. He offers advice, friendship, opportunity, and choice. Anakin never stood a chance."

1023,AskScienceFiction,"[Superhero movies] If Thor smashes my car, can the insurance company reject the claims under ""Act of God""?","Wall of text incoming....  


Short answer : There is no ""Acts of God"" exclusion in a standard personal auto policy, for damage to the vehicle that you own.  There are such exclusions in other types of insurance policies, but they are limited.  There can be an Acts of God exclusion in a liability policy under your auto policy.   


Long Answer :   


We need to define what an ""Act of God"" is.  It's different than acts of A God (or god, or demigod, or whatever).  


What Is an Act Of God?  


An act of God describes an event outside of human control or activity. It's usually a natural disaster, such as a flood or an earthquake. Insurance policies usually specify which particular acts of God they cover.   
In business, the phrase “act of God” is not associated with any particular religion or belief system. Contractual language referring to acts of God are known as force majeure clauses, which are often used by insurance companies. These clauses typically limit or remove liability for injuries, damages, and losses caused by acts of God.  
So, we've got our definition.  


So, let's go on to your auto policy.  There are several parts:    


liability coverage, for when you run into something and it's your fault, and the insurance company pays for the damage that you caused (to someone else's property),   


collision coverage, which pays for damage to your vehicle while it is being driven, and   


comprehensive coverage, which covers almost everything else.  


So damage to your vehicle from ""Acts of God"" IS COVERED under comprehensive coverage.   That are things like:   
Natural calamities such as a tornado, hurricane, flood, hail etc.  


Comprehensive coverage also covers things like:  

Theft or attempted theft of the car itself or any spare parts including accessories  

Falling objects, which include missiles or debris from construction sites  

Fire  

A civil unrest such as a riot or protest rally that may cause damage to your car or destroy it  

Vandalism that may be slashing the tires, keying, scratches on the body paint

Edit 1:

I did not consider one exclusion that might prevent coverage for applying.  Again, it's not because of an ""Act of God"" but this one:

( this comes from a 1987 version of a Travelers Insurance Personal Auto Policy. Fascinating read, by the way).

EXCLUSIONS 
We  will not  pay  for:

3. Loss due  to or  as a  consequence  of:

a. radioactive  contamination; 

b. discharge  of  any nuclear  weapon (even if  accidental); 

c. war (declared  or  undeclared);

d. civil war;

e. insurrection; or

f. rebellion or  revolution.

From that, we can assume his existing strength of body doesnt have much to do with his worthiness.  His strength of character is, and Cap's was top notch before receiving the serum.  It is, in fact, the reason he was selected in the first place."
1032,AskScienceFiction,[Harry Potter: Goblet of Fire] Is Barty Crouch Jr the greatest wizard in the world?,"I’m actually more impressed by his acting abilities than his magical ones. He’s able to nearly perfectly impersonate another wizard in front of people who know him much, much better than Crouch does for a whole year. That’s a ton of information to retain. All the mannerisms to impersonate, all the shared life events to remember, his job is a monumental feat. It is mind boggling that Dumbledore or MacGonagall didn’t catch him slipping up during the year. And it’s not like he studies Moody for a year, they ambush him and throw him in a trunk. Presumably they can interrogate or torture some information out of him, but enough to build a convincing character portrayal? Crouch is more impressive as a method actor than a wizard."

1037,AskScienceFiction,"[MCU The Avengers] Do Asgardian accounting standards use “red” and “black” to denote debt and non-debt, or did the Mind Stone simply give Loki such deep insight into Earth practices that he knew both Earth accounting norms and the symbolism behind Black widow’s “red on her ledger”?","I mean, Loki has probably been keeping tabs on Earth for quite a while - he must have had at least a basic understanding of Earth’s institutions and culture if he was going to pull off his unnecessarily complex tesseract mind control helicarrier plan

He either took some time to learn Earth languages, or more likely, he has the same sort of spell/translation tech that let doofuses like Thor speak (roughly) the same type of English as 21st Century Americans.

Which makes sense, given that Earth/Midgard is one of Asgard’s 9 realms. Makes a bit more sense than the Ravagers’ translator tech being able to speak to 10 year old Peter Quill in English, and vice versa. Yondu must have really gone the extra mile for that kid"

With his battle cry of ""Faaarrrk'n'El"", Farken'AwesumBloke is his world's foremost protector, fighting for Mateship, a Fair Go, and the preservation of his Centrelink Payments.

Admired and respected by his fellow heroes, he is known for his affable nature, honesty, being a 'top bloke', glorious mullet, racist comments targeted at anyone who isn't an Anglo Australian, and addressing his allies as ""Oi, Cunt!"".

Despite often being the first into the fray (particularly if he's been downing tinnies all arvo) he has sometimes failed to answer the call to arms, claiming he's ""..feeling a bit crook, I must've had a bad snag at the barbie yesterday.."", the use of this excuse after public holidays, long weekends or major sporting events leads many of his compatriots to conclude that he is indeed pulling a Super Sickie.

Farken'AwesumBloke has actually met Kal-El during the Crisis of Metric Shit-tons of Earths, and found him to be totally up-himself and unable to take a joke. The Crisis was a sad time for Farken'AwesumBloke, as his steadfast ally and good mate, the mighty KiwiBro, hurt his back during battle, and has (claimed) to be unable to work full time since, staying home and collecting a disabilty allowance instead.

Maintaining a secret identity in Alice Springs, Farken'AwesumBloke is known to his friends, neighbors and the Alice Springs Police as Gary Graham, a not-mild-mannered-at-all part time diesel mechanic and forklift driver. A well liked fixture at the local TAB, backyard barbies or Lasseters Hotel Casino on Barrett Drive. Gary, or 'Gazza' as he prefers to be known is considered by those who know him to be a good laugh, a good sort (and a 'top root' by his ex-missus).

1055,AskScienceFiction,[Lovecraft] How would eldritch abominations break someone's mind just by being perceived?,"> We only have so many senses ... normal electromagnetic radiation is all we can perceive with our eyes.

Are you sure?

When you were a child, you were probably taught that you have five senses: sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. This is true, but it's incomplete.

You have plenty of other senses. A sense of balance. A sense of time passing. A sense of changing temperatures. A sense of where your body is in space. A sense of acceleration. A sense of pain. A sense of loss. A sense of joy. A sense of agency. A sense of belonging.

You perceive the world around you in a dozen different, subtle ways, many of which you can't even name, and most of which you are completely unaware of, unless something goes wrong.

The right (or wrong) stimulus can completely change our psychology. When someone sees the Grand Canyon for the first time, they often report a feeling of overwhelming awe at the sheer size and spectacle. When astronauts return from space, return from seeing this great world of ours reduced to a tiny blue marble out the window, the report a sense of overwhelming concern for, and oneness with, humanity. When someone takes psilocybin or DMT, they report an expansion of their mind that fundamentally alters who they are as a person.

But what about people who have seen the horrors of war? People who have suffered at the hands of an abusive lover? Or people who have suffered something as simple as a car crash, and now break out in a cold sweat every time they drive? The wrong stimulus, applied to our normal, human senses, can irreparable harm us.

When someone sees a Great Old One, the sheer monstrous nature of it, the impossibility, the implacability, the inhuman and inhumane *otherness* of the thing that they have laid eyes on, is enough to shatter, completely and forever, their sense of who and what and why they are. It's like looking at the splendor of the Grand Canyon and realizing that it will absolutely destroy you, not because it hates you, not because it needs to, but because that is simply *what it is*.

Just as you were unaware of the fact that you *aren't* falling until I just mentioned it, you are not aware of the fact that you believe that you are important, that you matter, that you have any hope at all of making a difference in this vast and careless universe until something forces you to confront that fact. And that is what the Great Old Ones do. When you look upon them, you are looking at a power so vast and ancient and amoral that any sense of normalcy you once had will be forever torn away.

And that's just what we can explain with out current understanding of the human mind. Who's to say that we don't have some other sense, a sense of the cosmic, a sense of the psychic, that is triggered by the presence of a Great Old One? Who's to say that some sense, long dormant in the safety of our comfortable little world, isn't woken up as soon as one of those eldritch abominations appears before us?"
1056,AskScienceFiction,[MCU] Why does She-Hulk look like a regular woman while the Hulk looks like a 2 ton giant?,"Immortal Hulk gives this explanation.

Banner suppressed himself his whole life. He was scared of his long repressed hatred and resentment, so his Hulk became the person he was always afraid he would become- a destructive monster fuelled only by rage.

Walters was ignored her whole life. She didn't fear an inner darkness, she feared never being seen for all her accomplishments. So *her* Hulk became the person she always dreamed of being- strong, confident, beautiful, heroic.

Banner became the person he held himself back from becoming, Walters became the person she was held back from becoming. Gamma mutates are ""metaphor people""- what they become is based on the host as much as the radiation."
1057,AskScienceFiction,[General Vampires] My wife has a large “WELCOME” sign by our front door. Has she given vampires permission to enter our house?,"No and no.

You need to give express permission to enter, or at a minimum expect somebody to enter of his/her own free will (such as if you're throwing a party where anyone is invited). A welcome mat is neither of those.

Spidey is the first hero to be publicly infected.

After five years of carnage, Zombie Spider-man is one of the only two A-listed infected heroes left in New York, by virtue of his combination of hit-and-run tactics and his utter willingness to just take your head off with the first blow. His Spider-sense prevents the handful of uninfected heroes from pinning him down, he's able to strategically web up sections of the city to make them impassible to anyone but him, and he just generally turns New York into his personal bastard playground until zombie Kingpin shows up with a large enough army of infected superhumans that he can't take them all directly."
1063,AskScienceFiction,[Jason Bourne] How is Bourne able to continuously foil the CIA even though his training becomes more and more obsolete and he's missed out on an entire decade's worth of advances in spycraft?,Spycraft is a fairly timeless skill. For everything that advances with technology like satellite cameras and facial recognition there's still fundamental things that never change or do so very slowly. The guy that uses thermal imaging to find someone still has to physically approach them or get past simple but effective traps and counter intelligence practices. Bourne is excellent at the fundamentals even if his advanced game is lacking. It's very similar to the scene in starship troopers where a knife is used in a war with nukes. You can push a button to use a nuke but if you stick a knife through the enemies hand they can't push a button. Bourne is really good at using his knife against the CIA button pushers. They find him fairly easily when searching for him but actually eliminating him or capturing him is extremely difficult due to his skill set.

Like the Little Green Army Men, they retain the military training and approach of their backstory, but they adapt to being a preteen's plaything, focused on their charges happiness through play.

1066,AskScienceFiction,"[MCU] The Asgardians, an incredibly advanced species, couldn't find a way to safely remove the reality stone from Jane. So how did Tony, with comparatively lesser technology, do it so easily?","I think it's a combination of three things: 

First, the Asgardians had *very* little time between rediscovering the Aether and being invaded by Dark Elves. Nobody had seen it for eons. The knowledge Odin inherited was a flat-out lie regarding whether the Aether still existed and certainly did not include details like how to remove it. 

Second, there was little incentive for Odin to extract the Aether while it was contained. Removing the aether may have been a very bad idea without a sure way to destroy it (a mistake Thor makes later on). Odin would have had no problem sacrificing Jane if necessary. He regularly sacrifices Asgardians to achieve goals and he values humans far less.

Third, the Aether has its own intent and seemed both hostile to Asgardians/Humans and 'friendly' to the Dark Elves. Two Asgardians got thrown across a room just for touching Jane while it left willingly for Malekith. It's possible that this was taken advantage of in some way to extract it or, at least, that Malekith possessed the knowledge of how to control it (indicating that it was a matter of technique rather than pure technological ability)."
1067,AskScienceFiction,[Hitman] How is 47 not notorious when he's a tall bald man with a very unmistakable barcode on the back of his head?,"This is sort-of explained in a novel that serves as a prequel to the story of *Absolution* as well as some of the earlier games - Agent 47 is a boogeyman of sorts, only rumored to exist by federal agencies who aren't aware of him (the CIA knows since they've hired him before). But for everyone else, there's no reason to *believe* he's killing people.

And you want to know why? Because by official canon, all of 47's kills are declared to be *accidents*. There's always a way to kill his targets in-game using a non-obvious means and when taken, nobody bats an eye. In fact, killing people this way as of the game *Blood Money* means that they're not even registered as kills in the game's scoring system.

And going back to Absolution's prequel book, 47's reputation of doing so has actually become legendary in the ICA to the point where some of their agents botched a high-profile contract by attempting to perform their own accident kills and screwing things up.

And going back to Blood Money, it's actually a sort-of example because it's used to measure your overall performance in the game. As you complete each mission, you'll see a newspaper article discussing the events that happened during the level. This actually serves as your overall rating for the game up to that point, and the more obvious your murders are, the more the headlines talk about 47 and will slowly reveal more and more details about him, including better police sketches until they see your face. Later levels will also be harder since the NPCs will recognise you from the papers.

To lower your reputation, you need to replay the older levels and get a better mission rating, with the in-canon reason being that Agent 47 never left any evidence and was always ranked ""Silent Assassin"".

Also, he's surprisingly good at blending into disguises and fooling people, helped by his face being mixed-race and easily passing for no-one in particular, not helped by his wide range of skills."

Also they still don't really leave their borders except to trickle aid out so no one's going to be counting on them to solver international problems.  Strength doesn't matter if one doesn't use it."
1071,AskScienceFiction,[MCU/Spider-Man/FATWS] Why isn't anyone trying to recreate the Spider-Man formula?,"I think we can reasonably assume that no one really knows how peter got his powers.  MCU spidey's origins haven't been elaborated upon. While past movies have had the spider be genetically engineered, this spider could have just been a total radioactive fluke. Peter might not even know how the spider gave him powers, we just don't have the information.

Further Spider-man is an enigma to the public. As far as most of the world knows he is just some dude that hangs around queens stopping crime and occasionally helps the avengers/Tony Stark. With this in mind, most people even higher officials might just assume that spider-man doesn't have powers and is instead using tech. As of right now alot of heroes in the MCU either don't have powers, or they get their powers from technology (iron man, war machine, falcon, ant-man, wasp, black widow, hawkeye).

But I think the out of universe explanation is simply that the MCU has actively avoided peter's origins (either because of their contract with sony or for creative reasons.) Therefore I doubt we seen a plotline like that (at least in the immediate future). Also the whole finding spider-mans blood thing has been done before in TASM 2 and that movie was not particularly beloved."

Remember, as early A New Hope was there an imperial officer calling Vader's bluff on his ""hokey religion."" He didnt believe/know of the Force despite being the presence of one.

There were only 10,000 Jedi at their peak. Someone did the math (I forget where) but a *very* conservative estimate puts the ratio for Jedi to non-Jedi at about 1 per 20 trillion sentients. Meaning, the likelihood of you ever hearing about Jedi is very low, and *seeing* one is nearly a statistical impossibility. Luke did not know of the Force, Han believed it be a myth. If you grow up in the Outer Rim, stories of telekinetic space wizards will honestly seem like horseshit. Not to mention the Empire scrubbed any info of them and actively discredited them."

Assuming his equipment broke, and assuming Elastigirl can contort every single cell in her body (as seen in the comedic long hallway scene), it would be like taking off the grossest sock of all time. 

Mr Incredible would have to help. Watching his wife degrade herself in a way even Shadman hasn't come up with. Living the rest of his life knowing that Paul Rudd has been inside of his wife in a way he can only dream of. It consumes him, ironically. And finally one morning the Parrs find their patriarch floating face down in the pool out back. Violet slips into depression. Dash and Jack-Jack no longer have a father figure to look up to, as Frozone distances himself from the family, wondering if it was his fault, if he had abandoned his friend in a time of need. All the while, Helen is torn apart by the conflicting feelings of grief and a newfound love for Ant-Man, turning into a heartbreaking neglect for her own children. The cost of this situation is a broken home.

Tl;DR: Yes it can, and gruesomely, with emotionally devastating results.

Three things that support this:

1) his music operates at at least two speeds: normal and fast.  No cassette tape could handle speeds like that.

2) He drinks the Tab cola in Age of Apocalypse, but that means that the liquid would have to be moving at his speed too.

3) He also manipulates things at high speed but as soon as they're out of his hands they return to a more normal speed.  The students he throws, the Twinkie he let go of, the guards in the Pentagon.

1) It wasn't a Nazi site, per se. The Germans did have various digs, expeditions, etc... throughout the world prior to the war, usually conducted by the Ahnenerbe, a German think tank. They had a Frenchman running the site, and the Nazi military was never ""officially"" there. All their paperwork and permits would be in order, and any military equipment would have been deemed military surplus, and have been gifted to the archeological group, any military personnel were off duty, and probably shouldn't have worn their uniforms, and they will be reprimanded accordingly. The British really would have no recourse to intervene, and they certainly were not going to start an international situation over it.

2) As for why not just let them keep digging, Indy knew that it would only be a matter of time before they realized they were in the wrong spot, Belloq was still a good archeologist.

1089,AskScienceFiction,[MCU] Obidiah Stane kills Tony when he takes the Arc Reactor. Hulk is locked away like the Abomination. Cap dies when he crashes the Valkyrie. The only phase I story that is the same is Thor. How does the Chitari invasion play out?,"If I remember correctly, there was a deleted scene in Endgame where Rocket makes fun of all the Earthlings, because the Chitauri are jokes to the rest of the galaxy.

When he heard the Avengers fended off the Chitauri, he was like “oh those guys? Those guys are the worst, don’t tell me, you just blew up their mothership and they all fell over? Nobody takes them seriously”

Not sure if Rocket was being serious or if he was  just taking the piss out of the Avengers. 

Either way, I think Earth still wins against the Chitauri. From what we’ve seen, those guys aren’t nuke proof. Even a tiny tactical nuke launched from a single fighter was enough to annihilate their flagship. Earth has like, tens of thousands of strategic nukes that are thousands of times more powerful. 

And even without nukes, the Chitauri don’t seem bullet or missile proof. So yeah, New York is fucked, and maybe some parts of the Eastern Seaboard, but no more than that. Loki was a bit of an idiot.

However, because the casualties are in the millions instead of the hundreds, and the conflict rages on for weeks instead of a couple hours, the world doesn’t see the Battle of New York as a triumphant victory, but as a horrifying wake up call.

The world pours stupid amounts of money into “defense” spending and Hydra gets way stronger as a result. Thor isn’t the brightest bulb in the lighthouse, so he’s only too happy to help his human buddies.

Project Insight works without a hitch - Fury dies, Hill dies, all the targets including Dr. Strange, the Ancient One, Peter Parker etc. die. 

The American government, understandably, is totally freaked out by these three helicarriers vaporizing hundreds of thousands of its citizens. But presumably, the Hydra coup goes off without a hitch, and the US and its nuclear Arsenal is swiftly brought under Hydra’s control.

If the rest of the world acts quickly enough and nukes the US to stop Hydra, the world turns into a radioactive death ball and Thor is sad. Maybe he’ll try and get a few humans into Asgard as refugees.

But if Hydra’s plans go smoothly, they’ll be able to enact coups on all other nuclear capable governments and bring them under their control before the missiles start flying. 

They build more helicarriers, and soon the entire world has a gigantic instant death ray gun pointed at their head at all times, ready to go off on a hair trigger. 

Every few seconds or so, some person somewhere on the world starts thinking about maybe doing something about Hydra, like distributing a few photocopied pro democracy pamphlets, or buying a can of spray paint and graffitiing “down with Hydra” on some back alley somewhere.

A couple minutes after they start having these subversive thoughts, a blast of energy from their city’s helicarrier vaporizes them instantly, while also severely burning a few innocent bystanders and starting a fire in the apartment building. 

Hydra could have had them quietly arrested, tried, then executed. But a surprise giant death ray from above is something the entire city can see and hear, and it’s more effective at keeping up morale. 

The efforts of Hydra turn to the subjugation of Wakanda. Wakanda isn’t scared of nukes or Project Insight energy weapons because they have powerful force fields.

But Hydra has billions, and all the resources of planet Earth at their command, and Wakanda just has a couple million. Best case scenario is a kind of stalemate, where Wakanda is under constant siege from the rest of the Hydra controlled world, while Black Panther and the War Dogs conduct guerrilla operations to spark anti-Hydra uprisings. Lots of people get vaporized, and East Africa is turned into a giant radioactive war zone ruined by high tech superweapons.

It’s possible that Hydra has scientists smart enough to use the Mind Stone like Tony did, and create something similar to Ultron. If this Hydra made Ultron manages to hack into the Project Insight helicarriers, it could take over the world pretty quickly. 

Wakanda is still under siege, but this time it’s by robots and enslaved cyborg humans instead of Hydra. 

There’s a good chance that Earth’s wizards are too busy trying to escape Hydra or Ultron, and are unable to stop Dormammu. Strange died years ago when Project Insight was activated.

Dormammu swallows Earth, but gets a little indigestion from the Infinity stones kept there. 

When Thanos comes looking for the stones, he finds Earth missing. He asks his own wizards for advice, and they tell him about Dormammu.

Not sure how Thanos could fight Dormammu without a Time Stone. It might not even be possible, even with lots of help from his alien magicians. 

So the snap never happens, because Dormammu has eaten the Infinity Stones and Thanos is unable to get to them. 

Thanos continues his “killing half the universe” crusade the slow, old fashioned way, until somebody stops him or he dies of old age.

Life goes on. Hardly anyone notices that Earth vanished, except Thor and Peter Quill. They mourn for a bit, then move on.

EDIT:

Ok turns out I totally forgot about Captain Marvel. If Fury manages to send out his distress signal to her before getting killed, she would make her way back to Earth and whup Hydra’s ass six ways to Sunday. Project Insight helicarrier beams and thermonuclear weapons are scary, but Danvers is pretty much indestructible. 

So yeah things don’t turn out too bad. Carol, possibly with the help of the Skrulls, Wakanda and the wizards, defeat Hydra. The real problem comes from if Hydra decides to kill as many people as they can out of spite before they go down. 

Maybe they try to force Danvers to back off by telling her “if you don’t leave the solar system we’ll nuke all the major cities and have the helicarriers zap everyone who’s left”

But I think Danvers is the sort to call their bluff and just come zooming in anyway. I assume Hydra would have members who are still somewhat reasonable and interested in their own survival, so they’ll overthrow their more fanatical/crazed companions, and halt the mass global suicide in hopes of maybe getting a sympathetic jury at their trial.

So yeah, with Danvers in the picture, Hydra/Ultron is defeated, though possibly only after billions of casualties. 

Whether or not Earth wins against Dormammu depends on how many wizards are left alive (maybe hiding out under a Wakandan force field city?), and whether or not there are wizards among them ballsy and talented enough to use the time stone to defeat Dormammu.

If they do defeat Dormammu, that still leaves Thanos as a major threat. It’s possible that Danvers might try and convince the Skrulls to take refuge on Earth instead. I doubt the humans would mind too much, after all the crazy shit they’ve gone through, and they’ll gladly do anything Danvers suggests. That way, she can keep a 24/7 watch on both a devastated Earth and the Skrulls.

Thanos turns up looking for the stones, but because Danvers is already on Earth, his entire fleet is blasted out of the sky not long after he warps into orbit. Earth and Danvers are a little confused, but the Skrulls and maybe a few Asgardians explain who he was, and they go “oh huh nice. Good thing Captain Marvel was here and not, I dunno, a couple light years away from these critically important Infinity Stones.”

What’s left of the Nova Corps and Asgardians are happy that Thanos was defeated in like, 5 minutes. 

Thor in particular is happy somebody avenged his people, but is a little upset he didn’t find out about Captain Marvel sooner. That would have saved a whole lot of Asgardians lives (assuming the events of Thor Ragnarok play out) 

Thanos becomes a historical footnote, and nobody misses him except Nebula and Gamora, and even they are glad that he’s dead.

Life goes on, but now Earth is under Danver’s constant watch. She knows what happened the last time she flew off to some part of the galaxy. Never again.

Danvers doesn’t seem like the sort to go mad with power and conquer Earth as an immortal indestructible dictator. It’s likely she’d stay aloof from politics, just intervening during humanitarian crises, showing up and looking pissed every time say, policemen beat up peaceful protestors, or governments have ethnic minorities dragged into concentration camps, or militaries and terrorists bomb innocent civilians. 

She won’t be able to solve all of Earth’s problems, but a lot of the more obviously evil acts would be reduced significantly if there’s an angry glowing demigod hovering above the scene, glaring and giving everyone a “don’t fuck with me” look.

Clean water would be easy to come by too, for drought struck areas. She could just boil thousands of liters of seawater with her cosmic powers, then carry it in big containers to where it’s needed. 

Earth’s space program would also get a big head start with all the scavenged alien tech and Wakandan/Skrull technological assistance. And Danvers could help greatly reduce launch costs by just flying payloads into space.

Earth becomes a proper spacefaring civilization in a couple decades. Maybe they’d do it the slow way and colonize the Lagrange points, the moon, asteroid belts, Mars, Europa etc. Or maybe they’d join the galactic community properly. 

The Kree would hate them because Earth is harboring Skrulls and Captain Marvel. But there’s not much they can do to her, so they’re limited to cloak and dagger skulduggery and political maneuvering. 

Peter Quill could probably put in a good word for Earth with the Nova Corps. They’d be even more welcoming once they realize that humans aren’t all doofuses like Peter. 

Also they might not want to mess with a planet harboring Asgardians, Skrull, multiple Infinity Stones, an Infinity Stone powered superwoman, and is the home planet of a half human half god war hero. 

So yeah, with Captain Marvel in the picture, Dormammu doesn’t have Earth as lunch, and things turn out ok in the end. Not as interesting, but happier"

Banner is implied to help create the Hulkbuster and he was shit at using it - it didn't display the versatility and skill when Tony used it in AOU. It would also directly impact Widow and Hawkeye's more acrobatic fighting styles.

Was Palpatine born 'evil', or at least dark-side sensitive? Or was that a result of his environment? I think the more interesting answer is that he was born with that little spark of greed and selfishness that not event he Jedi could purge. 

________________________________

Because he's so powerful, Palpatine was taken as Yoda's personal Padewan. Yoda not only respects the potential power of Palpatine, but sees him acting selflessly (albeit with great passion) on a number of occasions, and believes that Palpatine could be a powerful force for good in the universe. He always has a nagging concern about Palpatine's passionate nature. Yoda spends countless hours working with Palpatine to embrace the stoic nature of the Jedi order, to understand that passion runs the risk of turning the power of the Force into a drug. What Yoda doesn't know is that it's been too late from the start. Palpatine had been controlling his parents through the influence of the Force for years before begin recruited, and had already affected planetary affairs on Naboo. As a Jedi, he had similarly been using his incredible influential faculties to build a secret following among the other most powerful Padewan. He's simply biding his time, with he and his followers soaking up all the Jedi training. 

Palpatine, eventually, locates and makes contact with Darth Plagueis. Plagueis is intrigued both by Palpatine's power and by his place within the Jedi order. Plagueis, busy with developing Force powers for the ends of immortality and the creation of life, charges Palpatine with becoming head of the Jedi Order and placing his other Dark Jedi on the council, intending to eventually return to a Sith order. 

While Plagueis is busy attempting to master Force impregnation, Palpatine (now secretly Darth Sidious) becomes a master, one of the youngest in history, and sits on the council. He's able to eventually manipulate the Jedi into thinking the Sith have returned and have taken control of the Senate, partially by staging the mysterious deaths of a number of Jedi council members and making it look like the work of an anti-Jedi faction. The Jedi move to investigate, but end up being spread quite thin. More Jedi begin mysteriously dying, and as it happens, more and more of Sidious' allies join the council. 

Eventually, Yoda is surrounded by enemies, perception clouded. Sidious, young and in his absolute prime, draws his lightsaber in the council chambers and kills the remaining pure Jedi, save for Yoda. Yoda, having gleaned enough of the plan to prepare, utilizes a Force ability never seen before: a Jedi thought bomb. The remaining powerful Jedi had mastered an ancient Sith technique in order to create a destructive force to wipe out the Force-sensitive in one fell swoop. The bomb detonates and instantly wipes out everyone in the room, save for Sidious, who is barely able to shield himself utilizing all of his Force power. So much power is used to defend himself, that Jedi across the galaxy feel the effect, including Plagueis. 

Sidious is scarred by the experience, his face looking like a skull, with sunken in eyes, but is able to heal himself. 

Obi Wan, having been given the position of new leader of the Jedi Council, takes the remaining Jedi and flees to the Outer Rim to regroup. Every Jedi in the galaxy is called to Dantooine. Obi Wan, who is working with the Force spirit of both Qui Gon Jin and Yoda, is able to help focus the remaining Jedi into a new kind of organization, a more pure form of the Jedi, whereby each individual Jedi is part of a collective mind using the Force. They're all individuals, but can access a single consciousness for the communication of ideas and the combining of Force sensitivity. Through this practice, a hundred Jedi, each individually unremarkable, combine to have the shared mind of an extremely powerful Force-sensitive sentient. It's through this that they discover the conception of Anakin Skywalker. 

While Sidious rebuilds the Jedi order into a secret Sith order, the remaining Jedi all descend on Tatooine. Plagueis is engaged by hundreds of Jedi, all acting in perfect concert with each other, and despite his great power is easily defeated. Sidious is aware of his master's death, and begins to assert more power over the Senate. 

Simi Skywalker is brought back to Dantooine, where she is cared for and is educated in the ways of the Force (she herself was highly Force-sensitive). Obi Wan explains what's happened to her, how she will give birth to the one who is prophesied to bring balance to the Force. She accepts her son's destiny and agrees to help, with the caveat that Anakin be given the opportunity to choose when he comes of age. 

The Jedi move about the Outer Rim, acting as selfless peacekeepers and recruiting the young Force-sensitive, rebuilding the Order to be stronger and more pure than before, and free of influence or danger. 

Sideious, meanwhile, has a full-fledged Sith order and manages to get  the ""Jedi"" a seat in the Senate with veto power, eventually placing a puppet chancellor at the head, a bold, beloved nobleman named Count Dukuu. Sideius' personal assassin, Darth Maul, slays the Senators who stand in the way, including a queen from Naboo. It's only a decade before the Sith rule the former Republic, now an Empire. 

When planets begin to withdraw from the Republic, Sidious finds them mysteriously capable of fending off Sith assassins. Fourteen different Sith die while on missions to assassinate leadership of seceding worlds. Eventually, he sends Darth Maul to investigate, and Maul catches a group of Jedi on a CIS planet. He's initially outmatched, which surprises him given that he's an especially capable Sith warrior. He gleans, during the fight, that there's a mental connection between the Jedi, and he uses that against them, eventually wiping them out. 

During the fight, when Maul gleaned the Force connection between the Jedi, he glimpsed a great deal more about what was going on. Pademe Amadala was alive, her double having been killed, and was acting as as liaison from the New Jedi Order to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. They weren't declaring independence individually, but as part of a larger strategy of the Jedi. And the Confederacy was huge, thirty times the amount of worlds that was known to the Sith. The new Jedi, including Anakin, were all nearly adults, and would soon retake the Jedi Temple and purge the entire Empire of the Sith once and for all. 

Maul, realizing the gravity of the information he possessed, fled to get back to Sidious as soon as possible with this information. Just as he's about to get to his ship, though, a young man in a cloak walks out of Maul's own ship and draws two lightsabers. Maul's taken aback at the immense Force-sensitivity of the boy. 

""Who are you?""

""I am Anakin, a Jedi Knight.""

1104,AskScienceFiction,[X-Men] Has Wolverine ever expressed any sexist or racist attitudes simply as a result of being born in the 19th century?,"He's forgotten more outdated social standards than most of us have ever heard of. 

He's also been subjected to more prejudice and hatred than most of us can ever conceive of, and forgotten a ton of that, too."
1105,AskScienceFiction,"[MCU] If Ultron came back and learned about everything that happened since Age of Ultron up to now, would he feel any differently about Tony Stark?","Thanos threw Ultron's proverbial rock at humanity and the galaxy at large (and a moon personally at Tony). Instead of letting the world evolve, they went back in time to undo it.

1106,AskScienceFiction,[MCU] Did Steve leave Tony to die in Siberia at the end of Civil War knowing he broke his suit and it wasn’t functional anymore? Or did he figure Tony had some back up suit or plan to escape?,"Knowing Steve, he would have radioed in that Tony was in Siberia, along with coordinates. So even if Tony didn't have an escape plan, he would be rescued."
1107,AskScienceFiction,[Marvel] does war machine send his suit to tony for repair and upgrades since he's the only one who knows how this tech works. Does tony give him this service?,"When considering the War Machine armor, the systems come in two classes; proprietary ""StarkTech"" hardware like the power systems, repulsor thrusters, etc, and more conventional military hardware. Most of the ordnance on the War Machine are conventional military weapons modified to be able to interface with the suit, and their care and upkeep can be handled by the armorers and technicians of the USAF. The StarkTech components are tougher, and a limited number of people (like Rhodes himself, technicians on contract from Stark Industries, Tony, or a limited number of outside experts) are trained and qualified to do stuff like swap out a dead thruster or upgrade the internal sensors and controls. If needed, during periods where Tony and Rhodes are on good terms, Tony himself could show up to help resolve a major issue with the suit."

1110,AskScienceFiction,"[Kung Fu Panda] If Tai Lung didn’t break out, would Shifu and the 5 have just kept bullying Po until he left?","No. The Furious Five were already beginning to warm up to Po before the escape, which we see from the scene where they try his noodles. Po was put through hell but stuck with it, and everyone but Tigress respected him for it. Tigress and Shifu would still have been hard sells, but if Tai Lung hadn't broken out, Master Oogway would probably have stayed. His wise counsel might have eventually prevailed over Shifu's stodgy expectations. Po clearly has a knack for kung-fu, and work ethic to spare. In time, he probably would have become a powerful master like the rest of the Five.

A more interesting question is if Po would have ended up like Tai Lung. Shifu's training produced two extraordinarily talented and powerful masters who were totally reliant on external validation to function. Po was already kind of a people-pleaser before he was selected to be Dragon Warrior, and we see how committed he is to sticking with his training no matter how brutal it is. Tai Lung was such an overwhelming threat, his coming forced everyone in the Jade Palace to come to terms with their own limitations, which is what pushed Po to finally accept himself for who he was. Without that push, he might have made for a very interesting villain."
1111,AskScienceFiction,[General Fantasy] If elves are so overpowered why are they basically an endangered species in almost every setting?,"In some circumstances, they're on the tail end of their time of prominence, and have been fading away for a long time. On Middle-Earth, for instance, the days of whole empires populated with Elves are thousands of years in the past, and the remaining ones are the ones who haven't *quite* gotten sick of the world and struggle and so on and so forth, *yet*. They're all just a few more headaches away from getting on a ship and going to literal Heaven, which is a thing they get to do. Heck, a bunch of them have been there already, came back, and know precisely how nice it is.

Similarly, in the WH40k universe, they spent so much time being the absolute king-shits of the galaxy that they got tired of being diligent, got very, very, very, very, very decadent, and essentially partied themselves to destruction.

In others, in many many others, it's not that they *don't* breed, it's that they breed *slowly*, compared to everything else. It doesn't matter how desperate a human might be to increase numbers, you're still not going to get more than a kid or two out every few years. For elves, in most cases, no matter how desperate the situation, it's still going to take years to produce each kid, and even then, you still might not get families much larger than a comparable human family. Depending on the setting, the fertile time for elves might also be limited. Consider that Elrond was around for at least 6.000 years, and only had, what, 3 kids?

Similarly, their wacky relationship with age can cause issues. An individual adult elf is powerful and skilled and can overcome great odds, and might be at the top of his game for centuries, or even millennia, but it takes that elf a couple of hundred years to get to that point. It takes humans, in comparison, a couple of decades to reach full strength, and there are always more of the sweaty monkeys coming up right behind them.

Elves represent quality, sure, but without *quantity*. Humans (or whatever) will out-breed them most of them time.

&#x200B;

(that being said, there are places where Elves are dominant, even over the long term. Both Arianus and Pryan in *The Death Gate Cycle* have elves being powerful nations that completely dominate their human neighbors.)"
1112,AskScienceFiction,"[Halo] I am a Covenant warrior, and I have observed a most peculiar war dance performed by the Spartans. What is this “teabagging”?","In human culture, sexual reproduction is intricately entangled with social hierarchies.

In many such pairings, it is established that one partner (often the masculine/father figure, but interestingly not always) has explicit dominance over the other (the feminine/mother figure). There are some indications that this arrangement was a survival trait for early humanity, although its endurance is a result of biochemical adaptation and cultural transmission rather than as a rational choice humanity has collectively made.

As such, humans, when in competition across such as arenas as sports, careers, sexual selection, and indeed war, tend to express their assertion of dominance/superiority in sexual terms. Equating their victory with a sexual assault is not uncommon, though in polite society it is considered uncouth. Likewise, sexual markers like large genitalia, virility, and secondary characteristics such as beard growth and height are perceived as correlating with success or winning- the nature of the correlation is not clear, as no studies have definitively proven whether humans think that success will impart these characteristics or whether these characteristics assure success.

The War Dance of the Tea Bag is one such example of this entanglement of sex reproduction and dominance in competition. The “dipping” motion simulates inserting the warrior’s genitals into his fallen opponent’s mouth, a sex act that reinforces the power difference between the masculine giver and the feminine receiver (I stress that the masculine and feminine labels refer to one’s role in the sex act, and does not always properly describe the biological sex of either party). By explicitly casting the fallen enemy as the “bottom” and himself as the “top”, the Tea Bag both raises the warrior’s standing among his peers the same as any other bold assertion of masculinity would, and simultaneously humiliates and demoralizes the enemy who is being forcibly pushed down to the lower levels of the social hierarchy.

It is currently unknown whether the Spartans believe the races of the Covenant have identical norms surrounding sex and social hierarchy (which means they believe the meaning of their war dance is perfectly clear) or whether they merely do it for their own edification."

1114,AskScienceFiction,"[Predator/Alien Universe] Why do people perceive the Predators/Yautja as these noble honorable warriors when the final act of the first one we see is to set off a ""YOU DIDN'T WIN!"" nuke after he loses?","Predators have a very strict honor code. It's not an honor code that matches with most human definitions of honor but it's understandable.

They match tools with their prey. It's not a 1 to 1 match and often gets ignored but generally if you have firearms they'll have plasma casters. If you have only your bare hands they'll only fight barehanded. 

They only kill worthy game. Prey that cannot defend itself can't be hunted. Prey that supports other prey such as mothers or guardians can't be hunted either. Sick or grievously injured prey not harmed by the hunter cannot be hunted and must be allowed to heal or even be protected by the hunter until it's healthy enough to be hunted.

Hunting grounds must remain untainted. This is the big one for your question. The hunters cannot allow themselves to be captured or their technology to be captured by lesser species. Doing so is both highly dishonorable and can lead to the prey species wiping itself out or worse becoming a threat to the Yautja as a species. The self destruct is meant to erase all trace of the hunter and preserve the hunting grounds even if it destroys a small portion of it.

No unfair advantages are allowed when hunting. Predators have to decloak themselves when firing their plasmacaster and cannot use their ships or more advanced weapons on prey that cannot match their capabilities. The gear seen used by predators is basically a hunting knife and flintlock rilfe compared to what they have access to on their ships or in their military gear.

There's dozens of rules and edicts they follow when hunting. Some clans have unique rules and others have very few rules. The above are just some major ones. There's rules for special hunts like the blooding rituals and rules for honor hunts and trophy hunts. They have an alien code of honor that doesn't mesh with our modern sensibilities but it's still an honor code."

1119,AskScienceFiction,[Star Wars] Why is older force knowledge sought after? What did they know so long ago that has since been lost?,"It's more of a classic meta-rule that ancient civilizations were always wiser and more powerful. 

Applied to Star Wars there can be several answers, depending on the time frame:

• For Luke Skywalker it's pretty obvious - he was left essentially with bare bones training, so he HAS to find ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING OF SUBSTANCE to rebuild the Jedi Order. New Canon Luke had easier time with it, since Jocasta Nu left a very big and solid cache of Jedi Archives for him to find, and Obi-Wan and Yoda probably could advise him from beyond the grave, but Old Canon Luke was shit out of luck and had to grab virtually anything he could get his hands on. I think it's not until he grabbed the Holocron from reborn Emperor he had something truly substantial. 

• For Jedi of the Old Republic - they had very comprehensive archives of jedi lore, that's true, but reading something in a book will never replace the experience of discovery in the first place. So to broaden their horizons jedi would visit ancient temples even if they already read about them in the archives, or visit other Force traditions to share knowledge and wisdom. 

• For truly ancient Jedi, before KOTOR and closer to Dawn of the Jedi era - well it was time of discovery and establishment for the Jedi, and even in those times there already were ancient fallen civilizations like Gree and Kwaa to explore and study. 

Basically the process of collecting knowledge never stops, it just changes what is considered to be ""ancient"". Luke probably would... well not kill, but fight for Prequel-era jedi training regiments, and prequel jedi would be very interested in insights of Tales of the Jedi-era masters on more arcane jedi powers."

1122,AskScienceFiction,"[Star Wars] Let's say Luke did agree to join Vader, overthrew the Emperor, and ruled the galaxy as father and son. How would they rule the galaxy differently?

How does it already have huge monsters infecting its trash compactors?","That was a [Dianoga!](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dianoga/Legends) They're very useful at breaking down organic waste, and it's not unheard of for them to be intentionally introduced into a garbage disposal system in order to improve operating efficiency."
1126,AskScienceFiction,"[Superman] During the Silver Age, Superman kept the bottle city of Kandor safe. Kandor had been shrunk by Brainiac. Now Superman could shrink and visit Kandor, and he was friends with Atom, Colossal Boy and Shrinking Violet. So why was he unable to find a way to restore Kandor for such a long time?","I believe the crux of the problem was not to shrink or grow for a while, but permanently change size of an entire city so it wouldn't be forced to rely on some dwarf star gismo to stay proper sized."
1127,AskScienceFiction,"[The Simpsons] How was Homer able to eat all of Hell's donuts with no ill effects, but nearly went blind from eating 64 slices of cheese?",Perhaps because he is dead he no longer has a real body or any actually feelings and is just a 'spirit'.

1128,AskScienceFiction,[Star Wars] There sure is a lot of sneaking around on capital ships and bases and stations. Can these places really not afford to have surveillance cameras in a few more hallways?,"Computer technology doesn't quite work the same in the Star Wars universe as in our own.  For one thing I'm struggling to even think of an example of a sharply rendered 2d image from a digital camera  in the movies (although I'm sure there is one somewhere) but more importantly their computer monitoring systems are totally different.  We build simple but reliable computer systems that are quite different from organic brains.  It's easy to imagine such a computer system monitoring a bunch of data feeds simultaneously and looking for movement.  But Star Wars is short on that sort of computer system, and instead seems to favor droid ""Brains"" which function more like organic brains than computers as we know them...much smarter and more flexible, but also with some of the same limitations.  I suspect if you wanted to monitor cameras with droid brains you'd need about as many of them as you would need human watchers, and they'd be somewhat prone to the same flaws as human observers.

Tech in the Star Wars universe is _weird_."

But the flash came out of nowhere moments later and decked the shark real good, and it was over in seconds. Then the second time King shark jumped out of the harbor, I just knew flash would be by in a nanosecond and it would be over. No harm done.  It becomes a part of the routine. You going to the boardwalk? Look out for King shark and flash, they'll be there at 6:35 pm.  Of course it may take us longer to accept or deal with stuff like the zombies, but the smaller incidents, the ""one shots"" if you will, temper us as a society for scarier situations.

1130,AskScienceFiction,[Avengers: Endgame] A lack of Pym Particles was one of the reasons for why the Time Heist was planned the way it was. How might things have been planned out differently if they had an unlimited supply?,"The only reason the Avengers went back to directly after the battle of New York is because there were three stones there. They probably would have chosen much less risky targets if they had the luxury to do so.

Why didn't they have other worlds colonized ideally under a yellow sun?,"In Silver-age continuity Jor-el, Superman’s father, was the first one to build a working rocket.  That’s how he and Superman’s mother met. She was a hot-shot pilot and he built a second rocket to rescue her after the first one crashed. Krypton’s gravity made getting off planet damn near impossible.

The Science Council was slow to embrace this new technology, but allowed limited space exploration and  they even had a colony on one of Krypton’s moons. Even this was ended when some idiot used a rocket to blow up the moon with the colony on it, killing millions. 

The science Council banned further manned space travel  and made Jor-El swear he wouldn’t send some poor sucker into space. Jor-El agreed but continued his rocket experiments with unmanned probes, robots, and animals, which was why Krypto survived the destruction of Krypton.  

The reason the Science Council didn’t believe him about the core instability is because they thought he was just trying to get more funding for his rocketry. Also, while most Kryptonian scientists were experts in multiple fields, Jor-El only minored in geology."

But mainly it gets seeped into deep undergrown reservoirs that the survivors cannot reach. There is also the idea that there is water elsewhere but it became super salient and the people don't know how to get clean drinking water out of it. Another possibility is that there is water elsewhere but the location of Mad Max has been cut off from the source point but geological activity.

One terrifying idea is that prior to the events of the movie, someone figured out how to use water as a weapon and literally ripped water apart to deny their enemies drinking water.

1136,AskScienceFiction,"[Lord of The Rings] Why didn't the White Council follow up on Sauron after they chased him out of Dol Goldur? Especially seeing as he went to the most obvious place in Middle Earth, his old stomping grounds in Mordor?","Primarily, Saruman, leader of the White Council, had become corrupt with a desire to have the ring for himself and misled the council with false advice. After Sauron openly revealed himself in Mordor, the White Council, in its last meeting, debated what to do. Saruman claimed that the One Ring was lost forever and that Sauron was no real threat.

At this time the White Council consisted only of Elves and Istari. The Elves were on their way out and the role of the Istari was to be advisory and not to take full control. With the Dwarves being increasingly isolationist, it fell to Men to deal with Sauron.

Unfortunately, only Saruman had a good relationship with men, which he exploited to seize control of Isengard and its Palintir (with which Sauron exert his control over Saruman). Gandalf was manly involved with the Elves and Hobbits (specifically Bilbo and his ring) and his interactions with Men was often luke warm. The other Istari did not factor into the stories of Men (or at least not the Men of the West).

So there really wasn't anyone save Gondor to deal with Sauron, and that was a gradually losing battle."

It seems pretty animalistic, and most of the fears we've seen it take on are fairly straightforward. The most complex we've seen are ""failure"" (someone telling hermione she'd fail) and ""death"" (A corpse), and those are both pretty blunt representations.

It seems likely that Harry fears voldemort hurting people he loves more then Dementors, but it turns into a Dementor.

1145,AskScienceFiction,"[Jedi Fallen Order] Why Did My Superior Officer Order Me to Place a Poncho in a Locked Chest At the Tip of a Branch, at the Top of the Kashyyyk World Tree?","It's not a poncho. It's the padding material used to protect whatever was in the chest. I suppose someone could come along and *use* that material to *make* a poncho, but that person would have to be pretty desperate and/or *really* into ugly-ass ponchos."
1146,AskScienceFiction,[General Vampires] Could a vampire cop enter a house without permission if they had a search warrant?,"No.

While a warrant is a judge giving Officer Nosferatu permission to enter a dwelling, it isn’t the judge’s home.  If it worked like that, the bloodsuckers would have discovered that little loophole ages ago."
1147,AskScienceFiction,"[Harry Potter] I found a document listing Rubeus Hagrid's height and weight as 11'6"", 289 lbs. Is he a skeleton under his moleskin?","I’m 99% sure whoever wrote that meant to say kg, not lbs."
1148,AskScienceFiction,[MCU] What the hell happened to Loki's strength?,The people he fought were enchanted and puppeted around by the other Loki. My guess is the enchantment comes with enhanced strength and he's basically just fighting himself.
1149,AskScienceFiction,[Marvel] Could Deadpool wield the Infinity Gauntlet without dying or being severely injured?,"There is a comic where he steals the gauntlet from Thanos and uses it to hold a roast for himself attended by many Marvel characters. He ends up being kinda depressed and gives the gauntlet back.

Then again, in the comics, just about anyone can wield the gauntlet."
1150,AskScienceFiction,"[starwars] why would imperial troops, who’ve already been patrolling the dune sea in armour riding giant lizards, with a visible presence in Mos Eisley, go through the effort of making the attack on the sand crawler look like tuskens? Surely time was a factor in their search for the droids?","This was Vader's operation. True, a false flag seems completely superfluous, given the fact that it was the empire, but perhaps Vader wasn't into swinging his dick around like that. I do think it's interesting he had the Lars family murdered."
1151,AskScienceFiction,"[Marvel/DC] Steve Rogers was born on July 4th. If other superheroes/villains had thematically appropriate birthdays, when would they be?","Well, Solomon Grundy would of course be born on a Monday.

1152,AskScienceFiction,[The Duck Song] I am a respectable lemonade seller. A talking duck has been coming up to business asking for grapes when all I have to offer is lemonade. What gives?,"You have three choices. One is to see a psychologists to determine if you're suffering from paranoia.     

 Second is to try and capitalize on this situation by letting people meet/greet the talking duck, by luring the duck with grapes everyday.      

Third is to kill or capture the duck in order to keep it from visiting you everyday."
1153,AskScienceFiction,[Marvel] Which people does Doctor Doom actually respect?,"Dr. Strange, I think? Doom has acknowledged him as a superior in the mystical arts once IIRC. I think he also recognizes Black Panther and Namor as kings, and possibly has an understanding with Kang."
1154,AskScienceFiction,"[DC] If Beast Boy could turn into a starfish, would one of his severed limbs regenerate into another Beast Boy?","1. Contrary to popular belief, starfish don't regenerate from severed limbs. They REPRODUCE asexually by fragmentation. 
2. There was a TeenTitans episode in which Beast Boy transforms into an amoeba and multiplies rapidly to overpower a virus inside of Cyborg, so we know he can reproduce asexually/clone himself if he transforms into a creature capable of it. At the end of the episode it's implied either all amoebas merged to reform Beast Boy or only one amoeba transformed back into Beast Boy. 

My guess is a green starfish would grow from the dismembered limb, but only the original starfish would transform back."
1155,AskScienceFiction,[Spiderman] Why doesn't the city of New York just give Sandman a million dollars at this point?,You could ask this same question in regards to various other villains. If they pay a villain to not commit crimes then a legion of other villains will ask for the same and threaten to wreak havoc and kill if they don’t get it.
1156,AskScienceFiction,"[Avengers Endgame] If the Avengers only had enough pimp articles to go back into the past and return to the present, the how did Ant-Man have enough left to grow and shrink during the final battle?","Captain America and Iron Man stole a large amount of Pym Particles from the SHIELD base in 1970. They had more than enough time to recharge Ant-Man upon returning, as they also had time to build their own Infinity Gauntlet."
1157,AskScienceFiction,[Invicible] What's the point of doing what Omni-man did at that point in time?,Better to wipe them out when they suspect nothing instead of letting them slowly realize and then plot against him.
1158,AskScienceFiction,"[Marvel/MCU] Earth is home to a genius who invented time travel and made Thanos bleed; a Sorcerer Supreme; fighters like the Hulk and Captain Marvel who can go toe-to-toe with Thor/Thanos, etc. Are all civilizations like this, with many extremely above average individuals, or is Earth unique?","I think earth is on the far end of the bell-curve. 

We are one of those nexus worlds where a lot of important shit goes down"
1159,AskScienceFiction,[Godzilla] Why do fighter jets continue to close distance with Godzilla?,"Godzilla usually stops moving to process the attack and retaliate accordingly whenever fighter jets are engaging with him. This gives the military time to make decisions. Not much, but still.  
  
There’s also no effective plan or solution for Godzilla, so I think a lot of it is probably also just... the military feeling like they should do *something*. But there’s not really anything they can do. So they just do stuff for the sake of doing them. Maybe they’re clinging onto some hope that they still have control over their lives when faced with utter destruction. It’s either send jets or accept your role in the universe is smaller than you have ever imagined.  
  
After all, Godzilla was meant to represent the always present, and unfortunately demonstrated, threat of uncontrollable annihilation."
1160,AskScienceFiction,"[MCU] If Iron Man had wished for Thanos and the mad titan's lackeys to all become unconscious for a week, would Stark have survived his infinity snap in Avengers: Endgame?",Doubtful. Even just possessing the gems all at once was causing horrific pain. He was likely getting a lethal dose of gamma radiation no matter what.
1161,AskScienceFiction,[MCU] How intelligent is Star-Lord? I assume he didn‘t get a proper education after he was abducted so he only has the education of a 10 year old? And how does he compare to the rest of the Guardians?,"Naturally, Peter Quill is pretty clever.  He picks things up fairly quickly, thinks on his feet, and seems to follow everything going on around him.  He's also gained a lot of highly specialized knowledge.  When he takes over as the Guardians' leader, he's shown to be pretty effective at it.  He's learned to be a good negotiator, he does his research on jobs, and he's a competent tactician.

He's also a man-child.  A sexy, witty, and clever man-child but a man-child.  Peter was abducted at the age of 10 and raised by a man who didn't mature much past that age himself.  Like his music and pop-culture references, Peter is permanently trapped in the late 1980's.  He's a ten year old trapped in a grown man's body.

None of the other Guardians are better off, but their weaknesses play off each other to make the team stronger.  Gamora isn't any more clever than Peter, despite being better educated, and she's just as immature; though her damage shows in very different ways, she similarly decided to just stop growing up in the moment she lost her mother.  Rocket explicitly hates people, has no emotional intelligence at all, and refuses to learn better habits out of spite; his skill with machines offsets that but he has no formal education so his knowledge is surprisingly narrow.  Drax is probably the most mature of the bunch, but also the dimmest; it's not just his difficulty with metaphor, Drax often can't read the room, is blinded by his anger, and makes terrible decisions.  Groot is an emotional rock and tries to hold the group together but, like Drax, he just isn't that clever and sometimes acts purely on impulse.  Mantis, despite her empathy, is so naive that she's basically helpless on her own."
1162,AskScienceFiction,[Harry Potter] Why are Love potions which are basically date rape drugs not outlawed and are treated so casually that' teenagers/kids can easily get them?,"Attention everyone:

Yes, J.K. Rowling is an awful person. That's not relevant on this subreddit. You are still required to discuss from a Watsonian perspective."
1163,AskScienceFiction,"[Star Wars] I'm an Imperial stormtrooper and some kid just attacked me with some sort of green sword thing, but don't worry I'm fine, I managed to kill him. However now Lord Vader wants to talk to me about the kid I killed and he sounds pissed. What's going to happen to me?","Hmm, well it is pretty abnormal for a rank and file trooper to manage to kill a lightsaber-wielder.

Almost like you're special, or maybe had some kind of help from an unseen force.

Just out of curiosity, do you ever have moments of highly-accurate deja-vu? Or do objects tend to move around when you are feeling emotional?

These are probably the types of questions that Lord Vader, or perhaps even His Excellency, the Emporer will have for you.

When they ask, just be honest. They'll know if you're lying. They'll *know*. 

But don't worry, they'll take care of everything once you inform them of your little specialties.

You may want to send a hologram to your mom before you go meet Lord Vader. Just let her know you love her and everything is fine."
1164,AskScienceFiction,"[MCU] What happened before Avengers Infinity War that led to Stark's incorporation of nanotech into his armor? The earlier Iron Man armors are advanced technology, then there's a leap to the armor being almost magical. Is there a reason for this incredible leap in technology?","Tony Stark's greatest limitation has always been his own lack of motivation and ambition.  For most of his life, he did the bare minimum he could to maintain his position as a billionaire playboy. He improved the Extremis in one night while drunk.  And based on Stane's interactions it doesn't seem like Tony wasn't that involved in the day to day business activities while at the same time the scientist working for Stark Tech, recognized that they weren't on par with Tony.  

It wasn't until Afganistan that Tony gained any focus, but at that time he was only going up against Earth-based threats.  The first few challenges he faced were people using derivatives of his own technology.  He didn't need to innovate that much yet.

The next big push was the Invasion of New York, which showed him that there was a much bigger universe and larger threats.  His reaction was the Ultron Project, this required a significant work but also ended up being a major failure.  This left him back at square one while also his conversations with Thor further convinced him of the need for better weapons.

And this is what leads to the nano-tech, Tony was now focused and eager to create something powerful.  Tony always had the capacity to create nano-tech he just never had the drive to do it.  But, once he had the motivation to sit down for a few months/years creating it wasn't an issue."
1165,AskScienceFiction,"[Harry Potter] Why do wizards even have house elves? From what we've seen magic can easily be used to do most household chores, so why bother with an elf? Is there anything wizards actually need or want that only house elves can do?","There's really not a lot a elf can do that a wizard can't do themselves. But that could be said for most domestic servants. The family of the house *could* cook their own meals, change their own sheets, drive their own car, or restock their own pantry, but they'd rather have someone else do it for them. It's the same with elves.

Also, a big one is food prep. Hogwarts for instance has a small army of elves preparing the food for the meals, which is then teleported up to the Great Hall. Certain parts of the process can be automated, but you still need someone at or near the stove to keep things in order; there's no going ""poof, it's a ham"". If a wizard wants a quality meal at home and doesn't have the time to cook it themselves, an elf or elves need to get involved."
1166,AskScienceFiction,[The Boys/MCU] what avenger would cause Homelander the most cognitive dissonance?,"Thor, someone being undeniably stronger than him would completely shatter his ego."

1168,AskScienceFiction,"[DC, Batman] So all jokes aside, why are there giant blimps flying over Gotham at night specifically?","As far as I know there is no canon answer, but I will make a supposition.   As you say, Blimps are obsolete; for travel or cargo purposes.  Not for Luxury Tourism.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking dining, like the 4 star $2000 a plate kind.  That would be profitable.  It is unique enough to draw tourists in for a once in a lifetime experience at a discounted rate (for the older blimps that are not THE new vessel)

All the real estate with a good view is taking.  Have a fancy date, go on thee hour blimp tour of the sparking city.  It looks pretty, from high above, in the dark.  Like the restaurant with the view of Niagra Falls that rotates over 2 hours to give everyone dining continually new view of everything.

Makes a literal good symbol of the rich and powerful being above everyone else, the poverty, the crime, the little people down their with small lives, their laws, everything.  Clearly Organized crime is involved in security so pulling anything there is is Joker crazy as far as the rogues gallery is involved; which is why we've not seen a situation up there.  Lack of petty crime means Batman doesn't visit either.

I'm thinking Bruce only goes there when he absolutely has to and had some high-tech concealed means of egress.  Or perhaps has a Batsuit stored in one of the security safes at each  Restaurant.  I fact, it Wayne enterprises owns a good chunk of the stock or handles security be may get it in no-questioned asked.  Like a diplomatic package.

&#x200B;

All this might make for a great looking comic or fan-fic for when something finally *does* go down on one of the blimps.  Not necessarily a conventional crime.  A serious mechanical problem could be as action packed and act as an out-of-the-batsuit adventure.  Like the one Bruce and Clark and Lois had on a cruise ship when it encountered Owlman and Ultraman  (which is a total classic).  [https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Superman/Batman\_Annual\_Vol\_1\_1](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Superman/Batman_Annual_Vol_1_1)

&#x200B;

Example of just one awesome  scene: (sorry for n link):

Lios realizes Bruce is batman, then runs into him with and Owlman.

Bruce Judo chops her unconscious and says ""She won't remember the last hour.""

Owlman quips ""Thy didn't you just shoot her."" A beat later after Owlman level thinking at the other's facial expression ""We're not going to get along are we?"""
1169,AskScienceFiction,"[DC] How does Batman possibly keep up the image of a horrifying bat-monster that scares criminals when he has several clearly human sidekicks, who are mostly children?","As far as criminals are concerned, there are basically 3 different Batmans.

You’ve got the guy who hangs out with the Justice League.  He clearly has some kind of superpowers.  Everybody knows that, he’s a superhero after all.  He fights alien invasions and stuff.

The second “guy” works for the cops.  He’s some detective, or maybe a group of detectives, who answer to Gordon and pretend to be a superhero so they don’t have to get warrants and things like that.  They use the teen sidekicks as a public image stunt.  Anytime Robin or Batgirl show up, you’re probably just dealing with a short cop in disguise.

Then there’s the Bat Monster.  There’s a thing that lurks in the alleyways of Gotham.  It’s probably a vampire or something.  Or a hideous mutant.  But it preys on criminals.  You’d much rather get beaten up by one of Gordon’s goon squad than face that thing."
1170,AskScienceFiction,[Barbie] Has Barbie ever killed anyone?,"Barbie has had some careers that may have involved killing.  

She's had multiple military jobs, She served in project Desert Storm, so that's most likely where she would have killed.  

Barbie has been multiple DC and Marvel Superheroes and Villains.  Wonder Woman, Catwoman, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn all willingly kill.

She's twice been a police officer, one time being a Canadian Mountie.  Pretty unlikely she killed there but not impossible.

She's been in medicine multiple times.  As a Surgeon she's likely had someone die on the table, but I wouldn't consider that killing unless she was negligent which is unlikely.

Most of her other jobs have very low chances of her having killed in."
1171,AskScienceFiction,"[Terminator] If John Connor almost choked to death, but was saved by the Heimlich maneuver, and it somehow became public knowledge, would Skynet send a terminator back to assassinate Doctor Heimlich?","No. 

Skynet can't afford a big screw-up in the timeline; it needs to undermine the Resistance without past-nastifing itself out of existence. Whacking a historical ""celebrity"" (even a minor one like Heimlich) could have unforseen, bizarre consequences, and there are lower impact ways to try and get Connor."
1172,AskScienceFiction,[Fiction in General] What characters fit the proverb “The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth”?,"I guess Carrie, in both a literal and metaphorical sense"
1173,AskScienceFiction,[MCU] If Dormammu lives in a reality where time doesn't exist then how is he talking and communicating?,"""Time does not exist in the Dark Dimension"" is probably a poetic way of putting it.  It's not exactly 100% accurate, but it gets the gist across.

Time behaves differently in the Dark Dimension.  You don't age, but things still sort of operate in a linear way.  Dormammu remembers how things were before the Dark Dimension had absorbed as many worlds, when it was smaller.  He knows he wants the Earth, and he doesn't have it now.  He hopes to have it at some point in the future, but he doesn't have it *yet*.  These are all time concepts.

But time behaves differently there, and it's all under the control of Dormammu.  In his own dimension, he's endless.  He's always existed and he always will.  What Dr Strange did was *limit* him.  Dormammu became trapped in a time loop, a concept that didn't even exist there until Strange brought it with him.

It's as hard for us to understand how time operates (or doesn't operate) in the Dark Dimension as it is for Dormammu to understand how it operates here."
1174,AskScienceFiction,"[Star Wars] Why would Jabba, a major crime lord even deal with Han Solo, isn’t he supposed to be much bigger?","By all appearances, Jabba liked Han Solo personally. That is why he took a personal interest in Han's debt. That Han is at least somewhat well known in the smuggling area also makes him a valuable ""demonstration"" to anyone else planning to stiff Jabba. It doesn't matter if you're famous, if the boss likes you, or if your ship is the fastest in the galaxy, Jabba will get his due."
1175,AskScienceFiction,[Marvel] How good would Cap's shield work as a pizza stone?,"It got hit by lightning and Cap didn't get zapped. My bet is it's a thermal insulator, so you'd get a soggy raw on the bottom pizza."
1176,AskScienceFiction,"[MCU] Was Thanos aware that toy bubble guns exist, or did he just think it was funny to make Quill's gun blow bubbles?","Despite being seen by many as cold and heartless, Thanos does indeed have a sense of humour."
1177,AskScienceFiction,[DC] How potentially dangerous would a person from our world with encyclopedic knowledge about DC comics be in the DC universe?,"Think it depends what he tries to do with it. He could be a giant boon to the justice league or the bad guys. Convince black mask or someone that Bruce Wayne is Batman, or go to the league and offer to help out with your knowledge. To prove you know what you’re talking about, spout out all their secret identities to them. Shit just whisper them all to yourself in an alley want wait for superman to show up. Then tell him what’s up and how you want to help or want a bribe from Bruce Wayne to shut up about it. 

Or if he’s a massive DC nerd, maybe he just wants to hangout in the watchtower and meet everyone before they help get him home. That’s what I’d do personally."
1178,AskScienceFiction,[MCU] Doctor Strange used a sling ring to get to the battle in Endgame. Why didn’t he do the same on the Maw’s ship after he’s released?,"One other theory: Doc Strange did not know exactly where he was in space, and was moving at extremely high speed, two things that are prohibitive to portals.

He could have ascertained his location and ported back to Earth once he arrived on Titan, but decided to look into the future beforehand."
1179,AskScienceFiction,[Star Wars] What would have been Palpatine’s endgame?,"After destroying the Jedi order, his goal was immortality and total domination of the galaxy. Not so much as nitpicking every decision every living being made, but on the level of everyone worshiping him as something akin to a god-emperor and the entire galaxy bowing to his every whim. Palpatine's whims mostly included studying ancient sith knowledge and delving ever deeper into the dark side. This was one reason he largely disappeared from the public eye once he crowned himself emperor, since the Empire was largely built to give him the resources necessary to keep plundering the galaxy of its darkest secrets. 

If he could have found a way to make himself into an actual godlike being, he would have certainly pursued it. And MAYBE then he'd get into the business of nitpicking every individual decision everyone ever made just to ensure it was to his benefit. 

He was never interested in extinguishing all life in the galaxy, since the force flows from life. He just wanted to control it."
1180,AskScienceFiction,[Batman] why exactly are criminals continually sent back to Arkham Asylum if it's found to neither be able to adequately keep them from escaping nor actually rehabilitate them?,"It's only been fifteen years in universe, and Gotham is a city where reform happens glacially even when it's for the immediate benefit of non-supervillian citizens. People who are smart enough or physically powerful enough to break out of jail with ease are, in the context of the DCU, a pretty new problem, and sociology hasn't caught up with them completely. Like every other social service in Gotham, they're muddling through.

This, of course, disregards continuities where Arkham's leadership is itself actively evil and pulling strings so that they can use the joint as a supervillian farm, of which there are many."
1181,AskScienceFiction,"[DC] How is it that no one recognizes Diana Prince as Wonder Woman when she goes around without a mask as a superhero, or without glasses as Diana?","It's pretty much the same as how Tony Hawk has a hard time being recognized as Tony Hawk when not actively riding a skateboard; devoid of context, people are more likely to assume casual resemblance than actual person, especially when it's someone famous."
1182,AskScienceFiction,"[Spider-Man] How is J. Jonah Jameson a two time Pulitzer prize winner, for want I presume is journalism, when he's clearly an unethical idiot?","He has been in journalism for years before Spider-Man was around. Aside from Spider-Man, Jameson proves a be a good journalist. He distanced himself from big political players for his news to be unbiased, and even admits when he is wrong and when Spider-Man actually does something good.

He doesn’t really hate Spider-Man personally, he just hates how Spider-Man can’t be held accountable for any injuries or accidents that he causes. Remember, Jameson doesn’t know Spider-Man from our perspective.

In any case, Jameson is probably one of the best journalists in fiction."
1183,AskScienceFiction,"[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2] Was the damage on Earth, due to Ego's seedling on that planet, enough to get noticeable mention in Earth news; and if so, what was the proposed explanation for it?

I sure Stark and Banner got emails. 

But as for showing up probably not unless they were nearby."
1184,AskScienceFiction,[Star Wars] I am a Jedi Knight dueling General Grievous. What stops me from just Force Pulling the lightsabers from his hands?,"General Grievous' claws lock in place, as has already been mentioned, but a bigger part of it is his reputation and presence. Many Jedi at the beginning of the Clone Wars were easy pickings since they hadn't been trained for war in generations. Faced with a monster like Grievous their willpower and concentration would have been shaken, and with it their ability to command the force. Notice that Grievous still loses to Jedi Masters like Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and pretty decisively."

1187,AskScienceFiction,"[General] Why do heroes have no qualms about mowing through thousands of mooks, henchmen, soldiers, etc. but feel conflicted about killing their genocidal overlord leaders?","It's all about sticking to virtues and code of conduct.

Killing someone in a heat of battle is one thing. Like countless stormtroopers you've mentioned, or Obi Wan during duel with Darth Maul. 

Having someone at your mercy and coldly executing him is one step closer to villany. Like Anakin did with defenceless Count Dooku. Or how Emperor tried to goad Luke into. 

Using power of an enraged, vengeful spirit, or simply not being fully in control of your actions and emotions is a grey area. Like the Hulk or Guts during his berserk rage."
1188,AskScienceFiction,[Toy Story] How different would the Toy Story movies have been had Andy collected Warhammer 40k instead of Army Men?,"It's probably less interesting than what would happen if they were 40k toys placed in the cupboard from Idnian in the Cupboard. Unlike in that movie, the toys in Toy Story don't get the powers/abilities that the characters they are based off of have. Their weapons won't actually work, but there's no way to know if it would be consistent for any psychic powers to also work or not (I'd lean towards not).

When Toys First get unpacked, they apparently possess the personality of their character a la Buzz Lightyear, and as a result any Space Marines are unlikely to ever believe that they are in fact toys as it would  violate the fundamental essence of their characters on a more fundamental level than your average toy including Buzz Lightyear. Which means anything thay doesn't conform to their beliefs must be destroyed. 

Without working weapons though, they are stuck fighting hand to hand. Of we can assume they at least keep their prowess in this area, then they simply tear apart any of the toys they consider to be mutants, aliens, or heretics. 

Andy would likely come to his room to find his non40k toys in pieces, with any opposing faction 40k toys still battling each other.    "
1189,AskScienceFiction,[Harry Potter] In what way did Snape being a double agent actually help the good guys?,"Dumbledore was the one who told him to offer the correct date of Harry's departure. Snape also told Fletcher how to protect Harry, with the decoys.

He gave Bellatrix the fake sword, which was just as important as taking the real one to Harry. 

And what do you mean ""without ever returning the favor""... Do you not remember him getting bit on the leg when he went to defend the Sorceror's Stone while everyone else was distracted with the troll? And I mean that's just the start of it.

The list of how he helped is [pretty extensive.](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Severus_Snape#As_a_double_agent) More importantly, perhaps *most* important, Snape didn't help Voldemort as much as he could. Snape was pretty strong."
1190,AskScienceFiction,[MARVEL] What is the relationship between S.W.O.R.D. and S.H.I.E.L.D.? Do they work together? What incidences do they each get involved in?,"In the comics, SWORD stands for Sentient Worlds Observation and Response Department. They deal with issues involving alien races - interplanetary diplomacy, defence of the solar system, stuff like that. Historically they have worked closely with the Wakandan and Canadian space programmes and the X-Men; currently, SWORD is mostly mutant, and closely associated with (although fully independent from) Krakoa.

They work with SHIELD when necessary, but there's no direct overlap to their respective official remits. SHIELD is all about what happens on Earth.

A lot of heroes are given reserve status, so Tigra and Falcon were getting cash from Stark.   Spider-Man has a weird moral code where he doesn't want to be handed money (probably why he's poor as shit) but has been offered this wage by Stark before. 

Reed Richards is pretty big on the philanthropy scene but tbh he uses most of the money they get because he's building HUGE shit constantly.

Professor X has a number of charitable organizations, but also runs a school/mutant rights group.

T'Challa is mainly focused on his own country.

The person other than Tony Stank who does the most like what you're proposing is Danny Rand who is a billionaire and co-founder of Heroes for Hire where he makes sure Luke gets a living wage.

While technically of course that's not true fully killed, as his spirit was released to wherever tolkeien spririts go, but effectively he'd be unable to take action in Middlearth anymore, and at best would reside in those higher realms, and at worst would be just a shadow, like one Saruman was reduced to.

1198,AskScienceFiction,[Tolkien] Why is it called Middle-Earth? Is there an Upper Earth and a Lower Earth?,"*The term ""Middle-earth"" was not invented by Tolkien. Rather, it comes from Middle English middel-erde, itself a folk-etymology for the Old English word middangeard (geard not meaning Earth, but rather enclosure or place, thus yard, with the Old Norse word miðgarðr being a cognate). It is Germanic for what the Greeks called the οικουμένη (oikoumenē) or ""the abiding place of men"", the physical world as opposed to the unseen worlds (The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, 151). The word Mediterranean comes from two Latin stems, medi- , amidst, and terra, (earth/land), meaning ""the sea placed at the middle of the Earth / amidst the lands"".*

1200,AskScienceFiction,"[Black Panther] T'challa is a cheater, right?","I think this is a classic ""ain't no rule"" situation.

The fight was to submission or death, on the waterfall. Killmonger threw him out of the combat arena, but there's no out-of-ring DQ in Wakandan politics.

While the rules explicitly ban performance-enhancing heart-shaped herbs (PEHSH), they apparently say nothing about receiving medical attention mid fight. I suspect that's on the honour system - traditionally, claimants to the Wakandan throne would be men of great integrity, who would treat their opponents with respect, and allow all measures necessary to avoid unnecessary death; as such, they probably thought a ""no first aid during time-outs"" rule would be both needlessly dangerous and unnecessary in all but the most exceptional circumstances.

Zuri Whitaker's intervention was another thing they probably didn't have rules against because it seemed not only unnecessary for there to be such a rule, but necessary that such action should be permitted. Every fight needs a referee, and the referee should be able to say to the fighters: ""Ease up, bro. You're taking it a little far.""

In short, it was kind of a punk move, and classic loophole abuse, but it's really on Killmonger for calling the fight early. T'Challa's later use of PEHSH would normally result in a disqualification, but A) given that his opponent was also rockin' them herbal 'roids, it seems a reasonable measure; and B) since Cousin Eric had murdered the referee, there was nobody to call him on it anyway.

> I hear the drums echoing tonight / but she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation.

Hearing things happening over long distances is a Perception check. Hearing something distant but clear, like drums, over the noise of quiet conversation is probably DC 10 or 12, depending on how far away the drums are and how loud the conversation is.

> It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you / there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.

Escaping a grapple is an opposed CMB/CMD check. Only the 8 nearest men can participate, as none of the hundred men have a weapon with reach (if some of the men have spiked chains or whips, this gets harder for Toto). One of the men initiates the grapple, the rest can each give +2, meaning they have a CMB to initiate the grapple of +14. In order for there to be literally no way (barring a natural 20) they can keep Toto, that means his CMD is at least 34. (CMD = 10 + Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + Dexterity modifier + special size modifier + miscellaneous modifiers.) In order to get his CMD up to 34, he needs 18 strength (+4), 20 dex (+5), and a base attack bonus of +15. Fortunately for us, Cleric, Druid, and Bard -- our three most likely classes, given what Toto does -- all get a BAB of +15 at level 20. By level 20, he's likely also had enough time to increase his stats to that 18 STR 20 DEX threshold; the 20 DEX will also help his acrobatics rolls to move through the threatened squares of the other 92 men that can't get in the initial grapple.

> The wild dogs cry out in the night / as they grow restless longing for some solitary company

Speak with Animals is Druid 1, Bard 3.
> I seek to cure what's deep inside / frightened of this thing that I've become

According to the core rulebook, a Remove Disease or Heal spell cast by a Cleric of 12th level or higher is required to cure Lycanthropy, provided the character receives the spell within 3 days of the infecting attack. If Toto ""seeks to cure"" his condition, it means he probably doesn't have the caster levels to do it himself, pointing to either Bard or Druid. That could also explain why he's stopping old men on the way, hoping to find some old forgotten words, and why he's so excited that she's coming in 12:30 flight -- maybe she's the cleric who can help heal his condition, but she has to rush there to get him that Cure spell within 3 days.

As for Blessing the Rains, that's probably Control Weather, which is a 7th level Druid spell, which Toto will have access to by 13th level.

It seems most likely, given his ability to create classic songs, that Toto has a few levels of Bard, so I'm going to say that he's probably a Human Druid 13 / Bard 7. He's had 5 stat increases, and we know he has 18 STR and 20 DEX in order to protect himself from those hundred men, which means he probably has something like 18 STR, 20 DEX, 10 CON, 10 INT, 16 WIS, 12 CHA.

TLDR: Nerf Toto."

1211,AskScienceFiction,[The Incredibles] Is the reason Edna Mode treats Bob the way she does because super strength is a really basic superpower?,"I feel its less that super strength is a basic power and more that superstrength doesn't really affect your clothes much. 

The only real consideration a superstrong man needs is avoiding tears, and it seems making the suits damage-resistant is routine anyway. Beyond that, designing for someone with superstrength is basically the same as designing for a normal human. Compare this to the two examples you use, stretching and shapeshifting, which raise very significant- and thus, *interesting-* hurdles in making a supersuit.

There's no *challenge* with Bob, is my point. All she needs to do is make a suit that makes a muscular dude look good, and she's a high-end fashion designer. She can do that in her sleep.

1216,AskScienceFiction,"[Star Wars] I understand that the rebels are battling the Empire, but why? What was the issue with the Empire running the universe? High taxes, too conservative, too authoritarian?","When Palpatine was given emergency powers at the start of the clone wars, several senators realized that this could lead to a very dangerous shift in the Republic. Palpatine gained more political influence by the day as many of the Republic's ancient democratic institutions were simply too slow to respond to the war. The emergency powers let him make decisions on a whim, and have his directives carried out as soon as they could be dispersed. No debate, no compromise. 

The Clone Wars were a deliberate pantomime orchestrated by Palpatine to frighten the Republic. Every battle was a performance that was recorded on the holonet, edited, and redistributed to sell whatever narrative Palpatine wanted to tell. (it was also a meat grinder to kill Jedi, but that's beside the point) So when he announced the formal end of the Republic to be replaced with the Empire in the name of security and peace, he was met with thunderous applause. 

But those senators who saw trouble from the beginning (namely Mon Mothma, Bail Organa, and even Padme) realized that Palpatine was not trying to make the galaxy safer. He was setting himself up as a monarch, and had spent years tearing down beloved and fair systems in order to give himself more power. He might have been loved by the people, but he was also becoming a tyrant with each passing day. 

Once Palpatine no longer needed the pretense of a galactic war to justify his decisions, his tyranny was obvious to anyone who looked. Yes, some planets had their taxes raised to ludicrous levels. And authoritarian laws made it illegal to speak against the Emperor and his military. 

But there were also things like having entire planets strip mined and their populations exterminated. Slavery, which had been expressly illegal in the Republic, was made legal again so long as it was done by Imperial authorities. Mass gatherings done in protest of Imperial decisions were not simply dispersed, they were slaughtered. 

The Imperial navy consumed resources that had originally meant to go toward building homes and businesses on countless worlds. Outside of the core, people lived in poverty and abject misery as the Empire took everything from them in order to build their fighting forces. And for twenty years, there was no one to fight, so it was basically all for nothing. 

The Rebellion didn't truly become an organized resistance until the battle of Yavin. Before that, it was a loosely aligned collection of independent cells. Each one fighting for a different reason and with different goals in mind. Many of them only wanted to liberate a single planet, or get revenge on a single Imperial officer. Their original fights were very personal. But when the Death Star was revealed, it suddenly became a conflict where the stakes were even larger than the Clone Wars."
1217,AskScienceFiction,"[MCU] So Odin is an Allfather, and I've been told that Odin being an Allfather held off Thanos from the nine realms for the most part. What is an Allfather, from what do they derive their powers, and how do I become one?","Odin's not AN All-father, he's THE All-father. Odin's father Bor was the All-father (which basically just seems to be the king of the Nine Realms) who had access to a power referred to as the Odinforce nowadays. It's frequently accessed via the spear Gungnir, although that doesn't seem to be required.


The Odinforce is basically just a vast power source that can be used to do magic. In the CU ""Magic"" mostly just translates to ""blasting people"", although in comics it has a much wider range of abilities. After using it enough, Odin gets tired and takes a nice long Odinsleep to recharge. I know that sounds like a joke, but is literally what they call it. It is also different from regular sleep in that he's basically in a coma for a little while.

Basically Bor died, and eventually Odin became the next All-father. Presumably that means Thor is next in line for All-Fatherhood because as far as we can tell it's a hereditary thing. 

Speculatively: The power probably has something to do with Yggdrasil the World Tree, and the Sleep is accessing the Tree's power to recharge the force. Maybe only Asgardians can use it, perhaps even only Asgardians who are Bor's direct descendants for whatever reason, but this has never really been explored. The only other person to use it heavily in the Comics is Thor, after Odin's death."

Wasn't there like a 90% chance if someone said that phrase they were probably referencing Voldemort?","Because if someone says He-who-must-not-be-named, it means they're afraid of him, and no threat to him. References to him ARE going to come up, since the ministry has blatantly begun acting on his agenda. But if someone is saying He-who-must-not-be-named, they're going to be saying it in whispers to dismiss the notion, and if someone bursts into their house a minute later, you've confirmed what they just dismissed.

Would this be a good call on guaranteeing my safety or would he kill me anyway?,"It depends how Joker is feeling. If he's in a good mood, you might end up on his crew that way. You can always use that and wait for an escape chance. On the other hand, sometimes he's just looking for something to emphasize his next joke. Be careful what you laugh at and really think about the results of drawing attention to yourself in that moment.


For example, if he has just thrown someone out the window and says ""Have a nice flight"", it is safe to laugh. The person who was his target is now falling to their death and it'll take him a second to move on from that.

On the other hand, if Joker has just been hit with a batarang and says 'Oh, Batman, you're sharp as ever"", it is not safe to laugh. If you do, he will stab you with it and deliver a follow-up one-liner such as, ""I've got your point"", or ""But this is sharper""."
1238,AskScienceFiction,[The Mandalorian] Do they really *never* take off the helmet?,"So old old old school mandalorians were vastly different from modern mandos. The children of the watch observe the oldest traditions of mandalore even though all other mandalorians have abandoned them.

The children of the watch are ultra orthodox zealots. To them mandalorians are only warriors. There is no other profession or skill beyond being a warrior and serving as a warrior. Things like intimacy and family have no place on the battlefield and are discarded. If a warrior is without his armor he is no longer a warrior. Be it by force incompetence or injury it makes no difference. You die a mandalorian or you are not a mandalorian. The children of the watch continue their order by rescuing and training foundlings. Be they war orphans or lost children they are taken in and trained to be ""true"" mandalorians. Once they come of age they either swear the creed and earn their place in the ranks of mandalore or are forgotten as another non mandalorian. 

Their armor is incredibly sacred and forged of their holy metal. To lose it either in battle or through trusting another is sacrilege and punished by immediate exile from the clan. They are a nameless faceless army the true might of mandalore and the legacy of all mandalorians that built their hard fought heritage. Anything less is a disrespect to that legacy."

On Tatooine, owning a slave implies a certain level of prosperity, and to bet one is one of the highest non-monetary bets you can make. It really isn’t a matter of practicality at this point.

1250,AskScienceFiction,"[ATLA] If Admiral Zhao had killed the Ocean Spirit instead of the Moon Spirit, would the oceans have disappeared in a similar fashion to how the moon vanished? Additionally, how would the Moon Spirit have assisted Aang in defending the Northern Water Tribe?","I don't think the oceans would dissapear, but they may well recede to some degree.

More importantly, tides would cease to function. The moon and the ocean are apush and pull; the moon pulls the ocean back, and the ocean pushes. With the moon gone, the ocean surged. With the ocean gone? I imagine all would be eerily still. Ships would be becalmed, unable to move. Fish would wash up dead, unable to get the nutrients they require. 

The ocean would not disappear, but the ocean would die.


Curiously enough, this would hurt the fire nation almost as much as the water tribe; it would destroy the water tribe's way of life, but it would also mean the ruination of the archipelago that makes up the fire nation. Similarly, it would ruin their navy. 


Finally, we're not sure what sort of powers the moon spirit possesses; save for healing and the fact that it's the opposite of the ocean spirit. With that in mind, I could see it forming a similar body to what the ocean did, but with a different set of powers; perhaps pulling ships down into the abyss rather than swamping them with water like the ocean spirit did. Perhaps pulling up ice to smash them in pieces or freeze them in place."
1251,AskScienceFiction,[Spider-Man] Do people get suspicious of Peter Parker being the only person who can take high quality photos of Spider-Man so often and in such precarious positions?,"Does anyone know he's taking the pictures? In the Sam Raimi films, J. J. Jameson risks his life to preserve Peter Parker's anonymity, so he's the only one who really can be suspicious of Peter Parker. And he doesn't seem to be, though I'm not sure why. I understand in the comics J. J. Jameson is really close with Peter and thinks of him like a son, so it's not surprising that he wouldn't consider that Peter Parker would secretly be Spider-Man. Also, you have to admit that if he were Spider-Man, he'd probably sell those pictures elsewhere.

In the Sam Raimi films the Green Goblin was suspicious of J. J. Jameson having ties to Spider-Man. Which he did. He didn't realize it, if he talked it would have led the Green Goblin to Spider-Man's true identity all the same."
1252,AskScienceFiction,"[Stranger Things] Why don't the boys ever use the words ""Telekinesis"" or ""Psionics"", despite being avid D&D players?","One of the things about gaming for those of us who lived through the era that *Stranger Things* covers is the ""cargo cult"" nature of the game.  There was no internet for people to talk to thousands of other gamers about their experiences.  If you didn't live somewhere with a large gaming convention, then your whole gaming world was the five or six kids you played D&D with.  

Everybody bought the same rulebook, but made up how to play on their own.  It was a common occurrence that if you found another group in your same town, even if you were playing the same game with the same books, you probably couldn't take a character from one game and play it in the other because it would be mechanically incompatible.  One group used Weapon and Nonweapon Proficiencies from *Dungeoneers Survival Guide*, another group used the optional Secondary Skills table from the DMG.  The third group used the Proficiency system but used the secondary skill table for the skills.  The fourth group didn't use any of that bullshit at all.

So it's entirely possible a group of kids playing in their basement who only had the couple of D&D books they were able to cajole their parents into buying them (despite rampant rumors of Satan worship), never heard of the Psionics optional rules or looked at the high level spells.

Dragon Magazine was the closest thing I had to a gaming community beyond the 10 or so people I met through my local gaming store (which back then was an actual book store).  The Dragon Forum was a lot like an internet argument that took months or even years to get going."
1253,AskScienceFiction,[Ratatouille] Why would a review from Ego be the death of a restaurant if he's negative about everyone?,"Ego mentions that he doesn't even swallow food unless he loves it.

Apply that attitude to his work; when Ego visits you, you're not hoping to get a glowing review, you're hoping to get a *survivable* review. A ""good"" review from Ego will be one filled with backhanded compliments, and nit-picking about what *wasn't* up to his standard (venue, wait-staff, the personal failings of the Chef, etc), but it'll be clear he ""went easy"" on them as far as the food itself went. Which, from Ego, will be seen as high praise for everyone else; ""damn, even Ego couldn't find something to complain about"".

Gusteau got hit especially hard because Ego didn't just critique his restaraunt, but his philosophy on cooking and food in general. He *eviscerated* Gusteau critically, essentially knocking him down from the height of fine cuisine to being equivalent to Chef Boyardee; essentially, he changed public perception of Gusteau's to be like if McDonald's had a ""fine dining"" restaraunt. That means more people avoid the restaraunt because their expectations are so low, meaning high costs of skilled staff and quality ingredients become more and more of a drain, which will lead to standards slipping and slowly sink the business. Gusteau dying makes matters worse, because how commercialised his likeness becomes means that Ego is essentially proven right, and there's no chance for perceptions to change until Remy comes along."
1254,AskScienceFiction,[Dr. Strange] Why does the entirety of the universe rely on four places on Earth to protect it?,"There seems to be something special about Earth and humanity.

Take the infinity stones. Power ended up in the custody of a human despite being lightyears from Earth. Reality did the same. Space, Mind, and Time all ended up on Earth for a time. Soul was guarded by a human, and taken by humans the second time (first, since it was before Thanos, but for them after...time travel is hard). In the entire universe, all 6 had a connection to humanity and even before Endgame 4 of the 6 had been on Earth.

It is one of the 9 realms.

A scientist and engineer from Earth was able to design weapons that went toe to toe with Thanos. It took the greatest of the dwarves of Nidavelir to do that. Rocket's quip ""you're only a genius on Earth"" falls flat when you realize Ironman did more damage than the Guardians *combined* with his puny Earth tech. There are other inventors on Earth who have gone toe to toe with Stark (Banner, Vanko).

Extra-dimensional mystic threats focus on entering this universe through Earth, possibly due to Earth wizards forcing any extradimensional threat to pass through Earth, and possibly them reinforcing a tendency that already existed.

Earth is special. Very special."

He needs to be right, and he needs people to tell him he's right; he needs to win, and he needs his enemies to acknowledge that they are beaten.

So when Thor, Iron Man, and Cap came to fight him, he met them face to face, because he takes pride in his combat skills; when Cap persisted in his defiance, he called in his entire army in order to crush him utterly. He didn't just want to beat Cap; he wanted him to *know* he was beaten. Hence bringing an army to what had been a single combat.

Then Cap produced an army of his own. But by that time Thanos had committed to the display. He'd put his army out there, and he couldn't hold them back to allow time for a bombardment without admitting that he might have misjudged the situation. Remember, his entire character arc is about being unable to admit that he might be wrong about something. So he orders his army to attack.

Of course, later he gives the ""rain fire"" order, because while admitting he's underestimated his enemy is a bruise to his ego, actually *losing* to this same enemy would be far more serious a blow."

1270,AskScienceFiction,[Star Wars] Why can Grand Moff Tarkin order Darth Vader around? What position can he possibly have that makes him higher on the chain of command than Lord Vader?,"They're separate but equal.

Vader is the supreme commander of the Imperial armed forces, superseded only by the Emperor himself.

Grand Moff Tarkin, aside from being a Grand Moff (and perhaps the most senior of them) is also in command of the Death Star, the single most powerful weapon in the galaxy. 

Moffs, however, are much more of a civilian position, as opposed to a military one, so Tarkin has some interesting overlap.

So, there are two likely reasons why Vader listened to Tarkin.

1) Vader was on the Death Star. Tarkin is in command of the Death Star. Therefore, while he's on the Death Star, Vader listens to Tarkin.

2) Vader didn't listen to Tarkin because he had to, but because he wanted to. When Tarkin tells Vader to release Motti, Vader says ""As you wish."" He really doesn't sound like he's doing it because he has been ordered. 

Likewise, Tarkin sounds more like he's just tired of dealing with the petty bickering and brinkmanship when he tells Vader to stop choking out Motti. Vader could have just said ""No, he must learn his lesson,"" and choked out Motti, and Tarkin probably would've just sighed, rolled his eyes, and filled out the paperwork.

Personally, I think it's a bit of both. Vader knows that, on the Death Star, Tarkin is in charge. Coupled with the decades of working together, Vader had a respect for Tarkin which he held for few others, and is more likely to listen to Tarkin over most others."

All we know for sure about the Sling Ring is that the user needs to clearly picture the destination, wherever in the Multiverse that happens to be.  Considering it can take the wielder to other realities wholesale, distance on the same plane shouldn't be a big issue.

But after seeing the ""One"" timeline, Doctor Strange knew the ring could do it because he already saw himself doing it.  Time's a funny thing."
1278,AskScienceFiction,[General] It is often said that a well written villain is one who see themselves as the heroes of their own story. Who are the best examples of this?,"Ozymandias from Watchmen was a great humanitarian and spent his whole adult life trying to help people in one way or another. He foresaw that the only way to avoid nuclear holocaust was to unite the world against a common enemy, so he manufactured one. He was willing to kill millions to save billions, which may seem cold-hearted, but it's like one of those ethical dilemma puzzles. If a train is about to crash into a thousand people and kill them all, but you can divert it to save them all and kill just one person instead, it's not hard to see how the person making that decision would still be able to see themselves as a hero.

1279,AskScienceFiction,"[MCU] If Living Tribunal or Eternals or other cosmic tier beings are a thing, why they didn't intervene when Thanos was going to destroy whole universe?","Like others said we don’t know the extent of beings like the tribunal, celestials, infinity, eternity or even death. 

In the comics those beings only intervene when their own existence is threatened but the tribunal refused to rule against the infinity gauntlet at first. He considered it infinity’s problem and not worth his attention.

Celestials might be bothered if one of their Petri dishes get upset. But since ego (maybe wrongly) calls himself a celestial.. we can’t be sure.

In the comics by the time thanos has the gauntlet he was more powerful then most cosmic beings. That was why they were bothered in the first place."
1280,AskScienceFiction,"[ATLA] Why is it that water benders need a source of water to bend, but fire benders can just create fire?","""Fire benders"" is a bit of a misnomer. Firebenders manipulate their chi, and direct the result as fire. To quote Iroh,""the energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire."" ([from the very first episode](https://youtu.be/Y7DhuekqsO8?t=17))

1281,AskScienceFiction,"[MCU] Did Captain America only budge Mjølnir slightly because that's all he could manage, or because he was holding back to spare Thor's feelings?","That's all he could manage. Remember, the only measure of whether or not one can lift Mjolnir is *worthiness,* as defined by Odin. This is a rather hazy concept, but you can get a general sense of it; imagine what Odin would define as the qualities that should be held by a worthy champion and ruler of Asgard. Bravery, certainly. Honor. Humility, to a certain extent. Steve Rogers has all of these, but he lacks a certain purity of purpose and self-possession. Thor knows that he must someday ascend the throne of Asgard and become All-Father himself, and he willingly accepts this responsibility and the power over others that it entails. Steve Rogers, on the other hand, sees himself as a loyal soldier, one to be commanded, preferably by superior officers, but failing that, by the higher ideals of the concept of America. These are not the qualities of an Asgardian warrior, who rather than subject himself to command should instead revel in the honorable battle that will bring glory to Asgard and the All-Father. Steve has many of the properties that would classify him as worthy, and as such he is able to *budge* Mjolnir, but he does not yet have the full sense of worthiness. Someday, under the right circumstances, perhaps he may wield Mjolnir, but at that time, he did not yet possess all the required qualities."
1282,AskScienceFiction,[MCU] Why Thanos thought that removing half of living creatures will make universe better? Was he aware that population will double in 100 years anyway and it will have no actual effect on greater scale other than pain of the survivors?,"Thanos suggested culling his people down 50%.  They didn't listen to his idea, because it was a stupid idea. Regardless, they fell. In Thanos's mind this proved him right; in his head, they fell because they didn't listen to him. He thinks that if only they had listened to him, they would've been fine. 

Gamora's species is apparently thriving after Thanos culled them, so this method does work sometimes. Although, we only have Thanos's word about it working out well for Gamora's species, so who knows. 

Anyways, yes, you're right, it is a bad idea. Thanos is an idiot though. I mean, just imagine being at that meeting.

For one thing, kings like Atreus, Agamemnon, and Menelaus are mythological figures rather than historical ones.

1295,AskScienceFiction,"[Star Wars] What happened during the closing moments of the Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith, that shifted the opinion of Anakin so quickly on the Jedi Council?","1. Anakin took Ahsoka leaving the Order too hard. He equated her action to leaving him as well. Another loved one sacrificed for the Jedi Code and the Jedi Order.

2. Anakin had been wracked with nightmares about Padme. Feeding into his struggle with bearing the responsibilities of being the ""Chosen One"" and keeping his relationship with Padme a secret.

3. At the Battle of Coruscant, Palpatine egged Skywalker into killing Dooku. ""*He's too dangerous to be kept alive*"". (This is a very important phrase that comes up later.) That was the ""justification"" given by Palpatine on why he ordered Anakin to kill. And from the time that Anakin was ordered to spy on the Chancellor, Palpatine has been telling Anakin over and over again. The only difference between the Jedi and the Sith is that the Sith was more open about it.

4. Anakin has been ""loved"" unconditionally as a son by Palpatine. The Council took Anakin for granted. Obi-Wan, the last person he's attached to in the Jedi Order isn't there to help his dilemma, tasked to take down Grevious, the last remaining Supreme Leader of the CIS. 

5. Then comes the fateful night, Palpatine reveals to Anakin that he was the Sith Lord all along. That he alone have the power to save Padme. Anakin, still loyal to the Jedi Order, leaves and informs the Council. Mace Windu trusts Anakin about Palpatine, assembles the best Bladesmasters available to confront and apprehend the Supreme Chancellor. He doesn't bring Anakin, probably not trusting Anakin to help as he was too emotionally close to Palpatine.


6. Anakin, blinded by his worry of Padme's foreseen death and Palpatine's promise, went the Chancellor's office. There, the aftermath of the battle. He didn't see how Palpatine killed 2 Jedi Masters in a heartbeat. He didn't see how much effort Mace Windu had to exert just to defeat him. He just saw one of the strongest Jedi Master holding one of his father figures at saber length.

7. Anakin begs Windu to take Palpatine in alive. He's disarmed. He's weak. He's evil but he still is alive to be interrogated to extract the knowledge that Palpatine has to save Padme.

8. Then the words. ***""He's too dangerous to be kept alive!""*** Then it clicks. It's all true. The Jedi are no different than the Sith. So thus, the Order's fate was sealed and the Republic fell for the Empire to rise in its ashes."
1296,AskScienceFiction,"[DC] Wouldn't Bruce Wayne's crime-fighting be better served if he left the Wayne company in someone responsible's hands (Fox, probably), then disappeared from public life entirely and dedicated 100% of his time to being Batman?","This happened in the Dark Knight trilogy. Bruce was screwed out of his own company and was left penniless. Sure, Lucius Fox could help but if he gets voted off the board of directors then Batman is screwed.

And it isn't just about fighting crime; Bruce Wayne uses Wayne Industries to help with social reform and city development. Sure, he can put thugs in jail, but if they're denied an honest income then their only means of staying warm and fed would be crime; nothing would change.

For that reason, Bruce *has* to stay as head on W.I. since less-scrupulous board members would possibly stop the charity work, switch to zero-hour contracts that barely pay and possibly cause an *increase* in crime since their employees would possibly try and make a quick buck to handle the mounting debt and the company won't hire ex-cons anymore."

Captain Marvel wears Kree gear, looks like a pink Kree or someone from Xandar, and is so powerful she may get her own category in people's heads - you know, the Godlike Power category. Maybe they think she's an Asgardian? She looks a bit like Bifrost if you squint. 

Iron Man... is probably unknown. His time in space was mostly spent either in Thanos' ships, on Thanos' dead homeworld, or stranded in space. No one knows about him, except maybe the Guardians or Captain Marvel telling the tale of Thanos' defeat. 

The Kree know earth. The Xandarians probably do too, so the Nova Corps has enough record of them to identify what Peter Quill is (half of him, at least). They see it as a backwater, a forgotten, primitive world, like so many out there. It's not important, or won't be, until the story of how Thanos Died there spreads far and wide. 

When the story does spread, several things will happen.   
  
  
People will believe that Captain Marvel did all the work, because that makes more sense than some pack of rubes on planet podunk took out one of the galaxy's biggest threats. 

Scavengers will come to see what's left of thanos' forces, and to pick clean the battlefield, only to find earth defended by what appears to be a nick-fury run S.W.O.R.D. 

A few will try to extend peaceful hands towards earth. A few will try to attack. A few will build cults around thanos. A few will try to find out HOW thanos was beaten, if only to steal that power for themselves.

1303,AskScienceFiction,[Marvel] Is Miles Morales just stronger than Peter in every way?,"All the Spider-People are unique despite their similar power-set. To answer your question though I can only think of one good example that doesn't involve Peter clones. 

When the daughter of Peter Parker time travels to a time when her father was at her peak she did a comparison. And one thing Peter is among even other Spider-folk is he's VERY strong and VERY FAST.  Which is interesting because even in Marvel the very strongest tend to be lumbering/brawler clunky compared to their faster agile counterparts.

Like, really, really, really fast. In your face. How'd he get there? Where is he? FAST. Combine that with uncommon strength for his power class and literal psychic powers that predict the future he can subconsciously react to? It borders on the ridiculous because he's fast and knows JUST where to go. Some random place that might be perfect in 1-5 seconds that nobody would ever pick because they can't sense the damn future. It's tough to deal with because then someone who can lift up a semi truck hits you EXACTLY where you don't wanna be hit from EXACTLY the place you can't see it coming.

1309,AskScienceFiction,"[Harry Potter] If a Potion Master and a muggle chemistry master worked together, could they do anything either couldn't do alone?","> If a Potion Master and a muggle chemistry master worked together, could they do anything either couldn't do alone?

Maybe? To expand on u/MjBlack's idea, the Wizard World seems to rely on tradition, experience, and passed-down knowledge in almost every avenue of study. 

The Scientific Method simply isn't in their vernacular, and even the most forward thinking, cutting-edge Wizards seem to rely more on observation of the natural world and learning long-lost secrets than on simple experimentation or even trial and error.

While it's easy to see how introducing the Scientific Method to the Wizarding World *could* cause an unprecedented magical boon as entire research facilities are opened up to develop new magic, I think there's a reason that magical research and development isn't already common: Magic is DANGEROUS and UNPREDICTABLE. Uttering a syllable wrong or even thinking of the wrong memory during a spell can be the difference between a healing potion or a landmine-sized explosion. It takes a lot of discipline to use even basic magic safely, and one person's happy memory may be ""happier"" than another's, making strict testing near impossible. 

Hence, the vast majority of Wizards tend to use tried-and-true, oft-repeated magic. Only the most disciplined minds, the greatest wizards of all time ever try to create anything new. And even then, it's generally safer and more reliable to either (1) discover something that's already been discovered, just lost to time or (2) already exists in the natural magical world and hasn't been understood and replicated by Wizards."
1310,AskScienceFiction,"[Harry Potter] If Hogwarts is the safest place in wizarding world, and Gringotts, the place with the dragon, is the second, how dangerous is life in the wizarding world on a day to day basis?","I think you are misunderstanding the usage of the word ""safest"" to mean ""least accidental danger"" in a context where it really means ""most protected from intentional harm.""

A good analogy to this would be a muggle's firearm. Muggles frequently accidentally injure and kill themselves and others with firearms all the time. In general they are extremely dangerous. If you put 30 teenagers in a room with 30 firearms, there is significant more danger to those teenagers than if the firearms were not there, provided there is nothing outside that is trying to attack. 

But if there are velociraptors (according to what we can find on the muggle ""internet"" these are a common muggle  threat) trying to attack the teenagers, a room with 30 firearms is much ""safer"" than the room with no firearms. 

The muggle equivalent to the safety of Gringotts would be Fort Knox, which is specifically set up to be safe for storing things. Finding a muggle equivalent to Hogwarts is more difficult, since the Muggles often do not have an equivalent school. However, the reason that Hogwarts is so safe is a mixture of having the most powerful Wizard in the world in residence, the other powerful wizards, who teach, and some historical levels of safety. So I would say that the best equivalent in the Muggle world would be the White House, or the Pentagon. 

And I could absolutely see someone saying ""Fort Knox is the safest place to keep something you don't want taken, except perhaps the White House"". But neither of these are inherently safe compared to a kindergarten classroom."

When reverting to Cringer he can clearly see and feel that violence is the worst solution to anything. But due to BC violence is the only way he is capable of interacting with others. This leaves Cringer in a state of near catatonic apathy and permanent neurosis on the verge of breakdown.
And Adam/HM encourages this destructive transformation nearly daily and even mocks C/BC for his trauma.

Look for a place in the nicer parts of town. If you can, the commute may be worth it to live off the island. Bad shit happens on the island. 

Don't live in Bludhaven. 

Avoid anything near Blackgate prison, Crime Alley, and for your sanity's sake, do not go near arkham. 

If you start hearing police sirens, move in the opposite direction. 

If you see THE BAT, leave. If THE BAT wants answers, you answer him. He won't hurt you if you cooperate. If you run, he will chase you.. That's what criminals do. Don't look like a criminal. He's been known to permanently cripple runners. Your new boss, Bruce Wayne, tends to take care of people who the Bat hurts without cause.... but better safe than sorry. 

The criminals are weird. they're violent. If you get robbed, pray it's someone from organized crime. They're far more likely to just take your money. The nutjob gangs will gut you, freeze you, gas you, or do weird experiments on you if they get a chance. 

Do not buy a gun for self-defense. The bat doesn't like guns. 

if you see one of the lesser vigilantes, exercise the same caution you would with one of the nutjobs - leave, calmly, comply as much as you can, and hope the Bat gets to them before something bad can happen.

1321,AskScienceFiction,[Spider-Man] How are Spidey's rogues regarded by other villains and other heroes?,"In-universe talk among the Avengers indicates Spidey does not get much respect from those he has not personally worked with.  The first impression of JJ's negative publicity has had lasting effect.

&#x200B;

Specific citation on his rep - was in New Avengers some years back   Heroes are sitting around and just chatting.  Iron Fist is asked ""Ok, who is the one guy you wish you could really take on in a  duel and beat.?""

His ansewer. ""Spiderman.""

The other hero's response ""You're kidding, *that clown*?"" Average hero who has not worked with Peter thinks of Spidey as ""That Clown"" 

Danny Rand explained ""He's strong, he's fast, he's smart.  Plus he has an edge.  He like, knows your moves before you make them.""  This  demonstrates how even those who are somewhat familiar with him have little idea of the whole Spidey-Sense thing.   

&#x200B;

As far as I know, only Tony Stark has ever done a complete technical analysis of it. During the Civil War when he and Peter were on the same side and the Tony made the Iron Spider suit for Peter.   His understanding was complete enough to put devices in his armor that jam it and simulate it (as closely as tech can).

&#x200B;

Then think about his rogues gallery a minute.  Many are actually very powerful, strictly a good bit more powerful than Spider-Man is.    Yet everyone knows he beats the tar out of them all the time.  He has a penchant for Embarrassing them by breaking their gear and leaving them webbed up for ordinary cops.  - and he is a clown.

His Local area is a microcosm all its own.   His galley focuses on committing crime in his neighborhood or have personal beet with him that makes them ignore the powered community at large as they pursue vadetta.

&#x200B;

Remember Norman Osborne and how many were in disbelief he was allowed to assume power post Secret Invasion?  He is one of Spider's longest known and most competent villains.  Yet he was not respected by the hero community at large.

So, unjustly disrespected and underestimated."
1322,AskScienceFiction,[MCU]What would be the consequences if each of the villains won in their respective movie?,"Iron Monger: Tony Stark dies. Half the universe is later killed by Thanos.

Red Skull: Captain America dies. Hydra destroys numerous cities and conquers the world. Half the universe is later killed by Thanos.

Ivan Vanko: Tony Stark dies. Half the universe is later killed by Thanos. Vanko still doesn't get his burd.

Loki: Loki becomes Odin's chosen heir. Thor remains in exile on Earth. Half the universe is later killed by Thanos, but not before Darcy Lewis's instagram page of Thor experiencing Midgard has gone absolutely viral.

Loki again: Loki conquers the Earth, or at least New York. He has a lot of trouble holding onto it, especially when Thanos takes back his sceptre and the Tesseract. Thanos kills half the universe, rather sooner than you might expect.

Ronan the Accuser: Xandar is destroyed. The Guardians are killed. Ronan rises up against Thanos and is slapped down, hard. Thanos's quest to gather the Infinity Stones is thwarted by the fact that, with Gamora dead, there is nothing in the universe that he loves enough to sacrifice for the Soul Stone. He carries on committing semigenocide the old fashioned way, on a planet by planet basis.

Malekith: Asgard is destroyed, the Nine Realms conquered, Thor and Loki both slain. Midgard trembles beneath the tyrant's heel. Half the unviverse is later killed by Thanos. The other half are still slaves of the Dark Elves.

Alexander Pierce: Hydra takes over the world. Stephen Strange is among the people they preemptively target. The world is consumed by Dormammu, who presumably sticks the Time Stone in a cupboard somewhere and forgets about it. Again, Thanos is stuck killing people a few million at a time.

Ego: The thousands of planets long ago seeded by Ego are transformed into single life forms, including Earth. Half of them are later killed by Thanos. The other half then seek revenge, destroying the planet to which Thanos has retired and killing the Mad Titan. Idiot shouldn't have destroyed the Infinity Stones.

Killian: Tony Stark and Pepper Potts both die. Starktech stock collapses overnight. Thousands of jobs are lost, and America's economy is badly damaged. Half the universe is later killed by Thanos.

Ultron: Earth suffers an extinction-level event. Ultron rules a planet populated only by himself, and his madness. Half the universe is later killed by Thanos, but Ultron ain't care.

Zemo: Tony Stark and/or Steve Rogers are killed, to be shortly followed by half the universe at the hands of - you guessed it, he's big, he's purple, and there's clearly something going on with his chin - Thanos.

Dormammu: The world is consumed. Suffering is all. Dormammu is all. Time is meaningless. Only agony endures. On the plus side, Thanos isn't going to get his hands on the Time Stone in a hurry. Really, Dr Strange should have looked at the big picture and sacrificed the lives and souls of everyone on Earth for the greater good (the Greater Good).

Killmonger: Wakanda becomes a terrorist state, fomenting and financing civil unrest and outright revolution around the planet. Then half the unvierse is... ah, you get where this is going.

Hela: Asgard is conquered, its people slaughtered. Thor and Valkyrie fall in battle. Then Thanos gives half the universe a free MfFlurry and a Happy Meal toy from the Avengers range each, leaving the other half to die of envy."

1328,AskScienceFiction,"[MCU] What's it like in the timeline where Thanos, Gamora, Nebula and army just suddenly vanished in 2014?","We can only speculate.

Event of GotG:

Quill wakes up with the Orb on hand, but far after the OT (original timeline).  
So Korath and his men are already here.   
I suppose the fight would be nearly the same as the OT, and Quill would flee in the Milano and try to sell it on Xandar.

Without Gamora, Quill only has to fight Groot and Rocket, but he's as underpowered as the OT. The 3 of them are detained in the Kyln.

There, they wouldn't meet Drax, who meets Gamora because of Thanos, Ronan, blablabla.  
Rocket's plan of evasion would still work, because Quill would fill Gamora's role, and the 3 of them would evade.

But, instead of going to Taneleer Tivan (Gamora's idea), they would have another plan.

I don't really know what will happen after that, but either Ronan find and kill them, or they are killed during the battle of Xandar, because Quill is foolish and stubborn and won't survive without his ninja girlfriend, or they will disband and mind their own business.

Aftermath of Gardians of the Galaxy

* Xandar is destroyed and Ronan possess the Power Stone.
* The Gardians never really assemble, and are either dead or don't care about other than themselves.

GotG 2:

If Quill is dead or absent from the Battle of Xandar, Ego will never hear of him.  
He won't search him, he won't try to conquer the universe... for now.

Event of Infinity War:

* Thanos never attack the Statesman (Thor's ship)
* Thor will land to Earth and establish New Asgard in Norway.

Variables:

* Ronan has the Power Stone. He might want to seek revenge on Captain Marvel.
* Taneleer Tivan still has the Reality Stone. He might want to collect the other 5.
* Vision keeps the Mind Stone.
* Loki keeps the Space Stone, without Thor knowing.
* Dr Strange keeps the Time Stone.
* The Soul Stone is still on Vormir, without anyone knowing."
1329,AskScienceFiction,[Comics]Batman never seems to pick up his used baterangs. Is there a collectors market online for them? How much does one cost? What other superhero cast offs are commonly sold? Arrows from Green Arrow? How comm are fakes?,"It's a bit like finding arrowheads in the midwest, you find some cool bat tech lying around the streets and it's not really worth much, but maybe worth a few bucks to an tourist (and there's a ton of counterfeit bat-gear sold on the streets to gullible rubes).

However, there's a few higher-end collectors who will pay big bucks for any batarangs you find. Word has it that Bruce Wayne is pretty interested in Batman stuff, and he's got an old guy in his employ that will pay a cool hundo for a batarang (more so for rare 'bat-droppings' - I know a guy who got almost a grand for something that looked like a busted GPS with batwings screwed on the sides).

1331,AskScienceFiction,[Star Wars] How does the galaxy deal with different rotations and time on planets?,"In terms of the Republic and the Empire, Coruscant likely served as the central timekeeper for political and military purposes, effectively a ""Coruscant Mean Time"" (CMT) much the way Greenwich Mean Time is used as a general time marker. Each planet would use their own time for their internal business, but when you'd set your schedules with other planets you'd use CMT to make sure everyone's using the same time. 

For travelers on ships, there's a few different ways they can do it. Either A) they can gently mess with the lights and timing during transit so by the time they arrive at their destination they're on the same rotation as the destination or B) maintain ""ship's time"" independent from their destination, set either from their port of origin or by CMT. The former is likely only done by smaller vessels, or by small non-crew groups on larger ships, effectively letting them cheat on ""hyperdrive lag"" in acclimating to the new rotation. The latter is more common with larger commercial and military vessels, as keeping to a strict, universal time table is often critical to operations and the individual comfort of the crew/passengers.

Regarding biological differences, it pretty much came down to ""go on human timing or go F yourself"". Even in the arguably more egalitarian Republic days, humanity had a dominant role in government and military, and when it comes time to get everyone to compromise on a schedule it's a human majority influencing the timing. Any species that couldn't hang with that timing was effectively handicapped, in turn further reducing their ability to influence the timetables and leading to a cycle where it was chiefly humans and human-equivalents making the calls on the schedule. In the Empire, which was a straight up human supremacist, this only got worse.

As far as the biorhythm of Jedi, they likely have techniques to get themselves on the schedule of new planets in rapid order; meditation, carefully timed resting to realign their sleep schedules, opening themselves to the local flow of life energy, that ""fists with your toes"" thing John McClane does, you know, whatever works."
1332,AskScienceFiction,[Marvel/DC] What street level villains could become national/global threats if they just applied themselves?,"Electro.

In principle, he's powerful enough to be an enemy of the avengers, and has fought them successfully until Thor's specific power to affect him stopped it. He has control over electricity and near-infinite electrical charge, and that's a *very* useful ability. He could potentially reach magneto-level power and become a very serious threat to the world.

But he's an idiot.

He has all this power, and he genuinely can't think of anything smarter then ""shoot lightning bolt at spiderman"". He could take the avengers one on one, if he had any creativity or imagination beyond ""break into bank vault"" over and over again."
1333,AskScienceFiction,"[General] I'm an immortal, and I want to keep giving myself my inheritance as a son; how do I do that without any birth certificate or personal information of the ""son""?","If you're worried about an immortal inheritance, I assume the inheritance in question is substantial enough to be worth the hassle. Do what any other rich person who needs a problem solved does: pay someone to make this problem go away for you.

In this case, that would mean forgery, fake documents and bribing government officials. For extra credible history, make up a marriage to a conveniently dead wife(that's the ""mom""; loner orphan type is the best, so that no one can question her mysteriously absent husband) and make up an education history at secluded schools; marriage certificates and diplomas are not exactly the height of anti-tamper technologies and schools are not Fort Knox.

Properly disguise yourself at your ""father's"" funeral and/or the reading of the will and then move away from that location permanently; or at least don't come back for a couple generations.

If, despite your wealth, you don't have the connections to make that happen, better make that the focus of your next ""lifetime"", no? Nah, I'm kidding, no need to get that drastic.

1335,AskScienceFiction,[Star Wars] I don't understand why it seems like the Resistance is small compared to the First Order. Weren't they the official government of the galaxy?,"The resistance and republic are two different groups. After the destruction of the second Death Star the New Republic spent a little while trying to clean out what was left of the empire. Most of them were taken care of, but a chunk went off into the unknown regions to form the first order and rebuild. 

While the First Order rebuilt, the New Republic was sorta getting its footing. They decided to demilitarize since they wanted to encourage peace as much as possible after the civil war, and didn’t think they had any real threats they needed a military for. Leia and the people who went on to form the resistance didn’t agree. They knew the First Order was out there and a threat, but once word got out Leia was Vader’s daughter, a lot of the New Republic stopped trusting her. So she went off to start up the resistance to do what the Republic would not while the New Republic continued to demilitarize. 

Then the FO came out and obliterated the central government of the New Republic and all that was left really was scattered local militaries and the resistance. 

I think it’s also worth mentioning the original Republic didn’t have a standing army before the clones either, so it’s not like there’s no precedent. Palpatine had to pull the strings to arrange for the creation of an actual Republic military force because it didn’t exist beforehand, at least not at any real scale."

Throughout, the Predator stalks and attacks ordinary teenagers or innocent townspeople; while they were always holding weapons at the time (i.e., a knife used for carving cake), nobody with half a brain should have interpreted them as real threats.

We see in many flashbacks of Fry's time in the cryochamber that Earth was devastated several times between 1999 and 3000. We see a couple of feudal civilizations and some attempts at rebuilding society, but there's no guarantee that society would even have a President, let alone a United States of whatever. In that sense, it's possible the ""Line of Presidents"" was broken for several hundred years, or that many of the Presidents (and their remains) were completely vaporized leaving nothing left to house in the Head Museum. 

My best guess is that only the Presidents who served up to around the year 2000 were salvageable (whether it be their real heads, or cloned ones using DNA from corpses).

First of all, they do not exactly take kids aways from parents. As far as I’m aware the entire thing is completely voluntary on the parents part. But please do correct me if I’m wrong. There is also a reason for their actions, an untrained force user is a danger in certain circumstances. The Jedi take them in young in order to raise them in an environment allowing proper training and control and letting them put their abilities to good use.


I will concede that at times young Jedi can act like what is essientsly a child soldier. But it has to be remembered they are not normal children, they are in tune with the living force. And outside of times of active conflict I wouldn’t be surprised if most combat was handled by more experimental adult Jedi. Jedi are diplomats and monks as well.


The reason I imagine the Jedi get rid of personal love is that they ideally do not wish their members becoming attached to anyone in particular. A true Jedi should feel compassion and love for all life, not prioritising someone based off of personal connection at the expense of others. 


Of course this hasnene acknowledges even by some Jedi has one of their order’s paradoxes.


Also a Jedi is perfectly able to leave. Count Dooku left the order peacefully and to no ill will I believe. So if a Jedi decides they wish to leave then there is nothing stopping the rule wise.


The Jedi your friend met may seem aggressive. But keep in mind that the Jedi are some of the most elite and powerful individuals who answer to the senate, even in peace times their missions would likely often have high stakes. Even if that particular Jedi came off as arrogant and aggressive, you don’t know what mission they had. Many Jedi are also different, each width different personalities and approaches to their duties. You even note that Master Obi-Wan was a chill guy.


Their actions against the Sith may have been harsh and could even argued to be one of their most questionable decisions. But keep in mind that the Sith are also a violent power hungry cult which  brought chaos and destruction to the galaxy and continually attempted to destroy the old republic. The fact that so much of the galaxy is able to live under a free democratic republic and not as slaves of the Sith can likely be owed to the Jedi and their actions in defending the republic from countless Sith incursions.


Jedi can only suggest things and it works best on the weak minded and those used to following order. While it is questionable they don’t appear to abuse it and many would be able to resist it anyway, some are even immune. The power exists regardless of if the Jedi use it anyway.


The temple on coruscant is presumably provided by the tax payer through funding from the senate. I doubt they have much of their own wealth outside of relics they are unlikely to part with. 


The Jedi are peacekeepers who have protected the republic for over a thousand generations. They saw the republic through a thousand year period of peace and have served the senate faithfully and loyalty.


The Jedi is not responsible for providing hot meals and places of sleep, there are already far too few of them. Those services would He the domain of social services brought in by the senate.


The Jedi are diplomats and peacekeepers who maintain the republic’s law and peace throughout all systems loyal to our democracy. 


That’s my reasoning anyway."

1362,AskScienceFiction,[MCU] How much did Tony Stark spent to save half of the Universe?,"As far as I know, no official dollar figure has been established, but we can throw together some estimates.

The Iron Man armor is able to out-fly and out-fight modern American military jets. Let's ballpark the cost of a suit at around [65-100 million USD](https://www.aerotime.aero/27553-Top-10-most-expensive-fighter-jets-in-2021). Intuitively, this seems a fair comparison; Tony would save on R&D costs compared to a fighter jet, because it's just him and his AI, but he also uses exotic materials that are harder to come by.

He's built fifty of the Iron Man armors, so we'll estimate the cost of his suits alone at **four billion dollars**. We'll lump the War Machines and Time Heist suits into this, since a few million here or there doesn't really impact such a large number.

He also funded the Avengers Tower and Upstate headquarters. In NYC, a skyscraper costs about [15 million USD per floor](https://buildingtheskyline.org/skyscraper-height-iv/), and if we guess Stark Tower was [about 75 stories high](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_New_York_City), that's another **one billion dollars**. Let's guess that the Upstate Campus also cost **one billion**; it's cheaper land and construction, but much larger and more advanced.

Now, let's estimate the cost of the Pym/Stark Time Travel device. This is a complete ass-pull, but let's compare it to a similarly complex physics experiment, the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider), which cost about **nine billion USD**.

That gives us a ballpark total of **fifteen billion USD**. This is an absolutely huge amount of money, but something well within the capabilities of a Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk, and Tony is probably far richer than either. And yes, he's likely able to write off most of these costs as R&D for Stark Industries, or as funding for the 501(c) that he absolutely would have formed the moment he decided to join the Avengers."

It's also  normal for anyone praying on moving transportation, like an airplane, to face in the generally right direction, and then not to worry about changes in direction past that point.

1377,AskScienceFiction,"[star wars] billions of years after the original trilogy, if the technology in the star wars universe went far enough does the milky way exist in star wars, and could someone travel to it?","Well for starters the Milky Way DOES exist, its just far, far away from the GFFA.

Now as for your question, it is technically theoretically possible to travel from the GFFA to the Milky Way. In fact, there is limited extra galactic travel already in the world of Star Wars. The Rishi Maze is an irregular dwarf galaxy locked to the main galaxy. It is where Kamino was located and can be seen in the ending of ESB. 

Now as for traveling to other major galaxies, like mentioned, it is theoretically possible but there are some caveats.

Galaxies are orders of magnitude further apart than stars, and while Hyperspace ""shortens"" the distance it would still take a massive amount of time and energy. A ship would have to be able to carry enough supplies, especially enough Coaxium, to keep the Hyperdrives working. It would be a very difficult and expensive endeavor, but again, technically possible.

The second, and more salient point is that a Hyperspace route would need to have been plotted ahead of time. You can't just aim a ship at a direction and jump into Hyperspace,  well you can, but as Han so elegantly pointed out, that is how you crash into something and die. A route with jump points and coordination with obstacles and disturbances, all which are in motion, needs to exist to travel safely. In the past, this was done by explorers who made micro jumps, recorded data, compiled them, and essentially made maps. A very time consuming, expensive, and dangerous endeavor.

It could theoretically be done between galaxies, but the thing is no one knows just what is in between. There are ribbons of dark matter, energy, and who knows what else. All of that would have to be mapped, and it would take eons upon eons of time. Again, theoretically possible but crazy difficult and expensive to do. It wouldn't be the work of a generation, entire civilizations would rise, fall, others rise in their place, only to rise and fall themselves in a countless series before the work could be done, making it very hard to fund such an endeavor.

There is also one final point. Legend has it that there is a Hyperspace disturbance that surrounds the galaxy, maybe all galaxies, making it nearly impossible to cross the threshold. The Rishi Maze is essentially a satellite of the GFFA that the disturbances have all but disappated between the two, but who knows with any other galaxy. If one is even able to leave the GFFA, there is no guarantee that one could find their way into another."

A major reason why he doesn’t like Spider-Man is cause he’s a vigilante who hides behind a mask and feels it’s a bad example for a hero. To JJ, he admires doctors and firefighters because they’re regular people trying to make the world better, as well as heroes like Capt America and the FF since he feels they have nothing to hide with their identities being known.

1385,AskScienceFiction,"[Judge dredd] if i see a judge take a bribe, am i allowed to call the judges on the bribed judge?","Yes, but be careful when and how you do it.

Judges taking bribes is a big deal, and a Judge getting caught doing it is catching a brutal sentence; 20 years minimum on an off-world penal colony with an atmosphere so harsh they need to surgically alter people to breath. Corrupt Judges tend to rapidly become desperate and dangerous if they fear getting caught, and with the power they have they can ruin your life in a heartbeat. A crooked Judge is capable of virtually anything, and is a threat to your well-being not to be taken lightly.

Your best shot is going to be to drop an anonymous tip somewhere outside the Judge's immediate jurisdiction. Contact the next precinct over, and inform them of the name of the Judge, and the exact location and time of the bribe. From there, two units get involved; the Public Surveillance Unit (PSU) and the Special Judicial Squad (SJS).

The PSU controls every piece of monitoring equipment in the city, and if the Judge did their deal in a public (or even many private) spaces, they have a hi-def video of it. Of course, an entire Mega-City wired for picture and sound means an insanely high noise/signal ratio, hence why it's critical for them to know there's something to look for, and for you to be as precise as possible to give them the best chance of finding the right needle in their legendary pile of needles. 

The SJS is the Internal Affairs department, ""the Judges who judge the Judges"". Their power to fuck up a Judge's life equals or exceeds the power a Judge has over a random citizen; they can (and will) force entry on a Judge's living quarters unannounced, pump them full of truth serum, and interrogate the hell out of them, not because of any accusations but *just at random*. Of course, this much power in the hands of a small group, ironically, is itself ripe for cultivating corruption, and the SJS has become crooked in the past. Ironically, this works in your favor, since the SJS needs to keep booking, cooking, and incarcerating actually corrupt Judges both to preserve their sweet position in the organization and to point the finger at someone other than themselves. Your bribe taker could easily find himself a scapegoat for the real crooks among the Judges."

He'd fly around helping with crises, and start stepping on their toes as soon as a single big one came up.  Superman can tolerate gloryhounds (there are a few in the league!) But wouldn't back down when Homelander does his creepy intimidation thing.

Homelander being Homelander, this would escalate to attempted murder, followed by a feigned apology when it turns out Superman is actually a match for the leader of the seven.   Vought would try to offer him a place in the seven and convince him to play ball with the fake superhero racket, but a combination of super-senses and his background as an investigative reporter means Superman would figure out the slimy underbelly exists shortly thereafter.

Vought are bush league amateurs compared to Lexcorp, so they'd crack like an egg.  Supes delivers evidence of what Vought has been doing to the FBI, and If that doesnt work he leaks it to the press.  Classified information be damned.  At some point there's a big *real* fight with Homelander, but supes wins that one by a mile, the only real concern is making sure it doesnt turn into a Man of Steel style catastrophe with thousands of people killed as collateral damage.

He’s the greatest wizard in the world as far as he’s concerned so he’s more than happy to assume that his own defences will be better than anything nature could provide. 

Also, while it may be difficult for us to imagine finding something dumped in the ocean the magic world has shown that they have very precise methods of detecting magic of varying kinds - even when otherwise unknown. Think of detecting underage magic use, or the mirrors which detect enemies based on proximity and a whole host of other things. Without defences there’s always a risk if someone goes hunting them. 

Lastly there’s the possibility of someone working out where they’re dumped non magically. Yes, a random scattering my seem pragmatic but, given nobody knows who Voldemort truly is, he has done a really good job in hiding them. An inaccessible cave with an enchanted lake hidden out of sight on a storm blighted cliffside is as obscured as can be to be honest and only hinted at if you know Voldemort’s life story better than anyone could be reasonably be expected to know.

* 1: Private search doctrine. Evidence unlawfully obtained from the defendant by a private person is admissible.
* 2: Independent Source Doctrine. If the police acquire illegal evidence, but also obtain the same evidence through an independent, legal means, the evidence is admissible.

If Batman broke into a house for unrelated reasons, and reported the ensuing Meth Lab he found, that would probably be fine. If Commissioner Gordon directs Batman towards a suspect whose house Batman then searches, then there can be a reasonable question about whether Batman is acting in a 'private' capacity, or a 'public' capacity.

1405,AskScienceFiction,"[Star Wars] In SW canon, were Jedi taught military tactics at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant? Was there a reason why Jedi’s are automatically in charge of the clone troopers in the field of battle?","Because the Jedi were the Peacekeepers of the Republic before the Clone Wars. They were specifically trained to take command of local planetary defense forces to deal with pirates and other hostiles that were too much for said defense forces in the first place. 

More importantly, the Jedi were literal force multipliers, using the Force to enhance the troops other them to perform better and fight against odds that would have destroyed regular troops."
1406,AskScienceFiction,[Star Wars] Why does Jabba The Hutt have nubile humanoid slave girls in skimpy outfits? Shouldn't he be into giant slug monsters like him?,"I personally think it's more about Jabba showing off his status and power than anything. If you think about all the different people he keeps around his palace, are they going to be more impressed that you have hutt slave girls, or that you have humanoid slave girls which are probably considered more conventionally attractive throughout the galaxy?

(Also there is precedent for Hutts being attracted to other species, like Jabba's uncle)"

It can do anything you can imagine. Provided you have the will.

Hal Jordan's ring resurrected him from the Black Lantern Corps & he used it to kill a Guardian of the Universe even though they deliberately programmed it to be impossible. Sinestro used his ring to make another ring.

I think the only exceptions are magic (For obvious reasons & the fact that the Guardians hate magic) & New God technology like Boom Tubes."

1411,AskScienceFiction,[HARRY POTTER] Voldemort straight up dies just as Harry gets to Hogwarts. How does Harry's life progress?,"Harry has a perfectly normal first year of school. Him and Ron don’t make friends with Hermione without the troll incident, so the trio never gets together. Dumbledore realizes what happened (if I recall correctly, he or at least Snape were aware that something was wrong with Quirrel) and weeps in joy, knowing that the Wizarding World is finally safe from evil. 

Things change now. With Voldemort dead the DADA curse is broken, so Quirrel could actually stay on as the Defense professor for as long as he wanted. Whether or not he does is unknown. Lucius Malfoy would still slip Ginny the diary in order to ruin Arthur-remember, he thought that LV was dead at that point, so nothing changed there. When nothing happens, he shrugs it off, realizing it’s not worth the hassle. Dobby wouldn’t know the Horcrux is gone, so his shenanigans would still happen and he likely isn’t freed, unless Harry gets the chance to see him in person with Malfoy. 

The Weasleys never show up in the Prophet, so Sirius never escapes Azkaban. Lupin might reach out to Harry if he doesn’t eventually become a teacher, or Dumbledore will encourage it. Actually he’ll probably also do something about the Dursley’s, since with Voldy gone Harry doesn’t need to be put in a “better off surviving miserable then dead” situation. The Triwizard tournament goes off without a hitch, and likely continues onward for years. Umbridge never comes to Hogwarts, and neither does Slughorn. The class of 98’ graduates without issue, and joins society without any status quo changes.

Edit: u/Canuckeball pointed out how the Weasley’s were in the paper because they won the lottery and were going to Egypt. This would have Sirius escape, kicking off most of Book 3 anyway. It’s been a while since I read that one, so I can’t tell what would have changed as a result. Someone with more knowledge will have to."
1412,AskScienceFiction,[Avatar: The Last Airbender] What if Aang had witnessed the Air Temple Massacre but was still frozen for those 100 years?,"Well he definitely kills Ozai, for one.

&#x200B;

Aang will still feel so much guilt. He'll still feel that he failed to save them, regardless of the fact that he actually tried this time. He's gonna be a lot more militant overall, be more willing to kill, since in your scenario he's already killed several people.

&#x200B;

He'll probably defeat the Firelord, but there won't be so much peace by the end. No friendship with Zuko to reform the fire nation and make reparations. It'll be more like Germany post World War 1, just waiting for another brutal leader to rescue them from disarmament and disgrace.

Aang acting like a hammer against the Fire Nation, as opposed to him struggling to find a genuine end to the war, for the sake of everybody, will only lead to more suffering."
1413,AskScienceFiction,[The Addams Family] Are they evil? Do they really kill and hurt people? Or is it all just a joke?,"Going off of the live action series (I heavily recommend it, though it is pretty different from the movies and cartoons), the Addams family never actually cause serious harm to anyone that I can think of, intentionally or otherwise.

They seem to be immune to damage.  Gomez is incredibly generous (in a Halloween episode, he thinks that two thieves are trick-or-treaters; he sees their bags of cash, and thinks it's a new holiday thing, so he gives them thousands of dollars in cash).

In the first episode or a very early episode, Wednesday returns from public school crying over the idea of a knight killing an innocent dragon that was just sleeping on his own money.

Hell, when Morticia believes that Gomez is cheating on her with Pugsley's teacher, she just gets sad and decides that she would prefer for him to be happy, so she packs her bags to leave.

All-in-all, they're creepy and cooky, but they are kind, peaceful people."

[This has an RF modulator as part of the standard kit](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/1014910/Jvc-Gr-C1.html?page=36#manual). Not all that clear why Marty would have had it with him though since it's usually not carried with the camera.

Of course, even if he didn't, remember; Doc is almost supernaturally intelligent. He most likely already knows how video signals and modulation work and would be able to build a modulator, or adapt the television appropriately."
1415,AskScienceFiction,[Dune] Why doesn't the Emperor just take control of Arrakis for himself?,"He's not powerful enough to pull that off. 

The emperor's wealth and military might is roughly on par with all great houses put together. That means he's only top dog if the great houses are divided and waging kanly on each other. If he seized Arrakis for himself, he'd piss off all the great houses at once, so much so they'd stop fighting and take him on. If he loses he's dead. If he wins, he's the emperor of nothing but ash and ruin. The only winning move is not to play.

 Plus, he's got hella CHOAM shares already, what's his motivation? Whereas, not taking direct control of Arrakis and outsourcing the work to one great house or another allows him to play politics and keep them divided under his rule. Which is precisely what he did when a certain Duke got too popular..."

1421,AskScienceFiction,[The Matrix] Is it always 1999 inside the Matrix?,"No.

The world that the Machines created inside the Matrix is a world that is meant to appear in and around the technological capabilities of 1999.

As you may know, the Matrix is inherently unstable and requires to be reset every so often. These cycles are about 100 years in length, and we know that there have been at least 6 cycles.

The Machines want humanity inside the Matrix to think and act a certain way, and they have deduced that the easiest way to control humanity inside is through this era of technological advances. People have computers and cell phones. The internet exists but is limited and not as easy or as comprehensive as in our time. People can get and spread communication, but it is easier for the Machines to monitor and curate. Any glitches or incursions from those outside the Matrix are easily contained, and humanity is led to believe what the Machines want them to believe.

In order to keep this status quo, the Machines created the idea that the technology of the world of the Matrix is peak advancement. Oh there will be small changes and advancements added over the years, but they are few and far between and change little of the capabilities humanity can access.

So its not always the year 1999, the dates on the calender do change, but for those inside the Matrix it is a century or so where 1999 is as advanced as we get. And when the only information anyone can receive is curated by the Machines, it is an easy lie to make people believe. The Machines make it so that any advancement is impossible, and anyone who bucks that belief are either quietly disappeared by the Agents long before they can get their ideas out due to the technological limits in place, or if they are lucky, extracted by Zion.

It is also important to remember, even what the people outside in Zion believe is information that is heavily curated by the Machines, they only know what the Machines allow them to know, as part of their system of control. Remember, the Machines are not on our side, they are not there to secretly keep us going for our own sake. We are nothing more than a crop to them, and they will use whatever is in their power to keep us under their control."
1422,AskScienceFiction,[Spider-Man] So I just found Spider-Man’s web slingers and he left a full canister of webbing in them. Can I use them?,"No, it's not a good idea. 

Spider-Man has enhanced strength, balance and the ability to cling to walls as a way to stop falling. He also has a sixth sense that tells him if he's doing something dangerous. 

When normal people swing on a rope, they have to grip it with their legs because supporting their full body weight with one hand requires a lot of strength. I'm not saying that it can't be done briefly, but if you loose your grip you will splash. 

You can use weblines for other purposes. You can probably even climb them like a normal person climbs a rope, but holding yourself up with one hand while swinging and changing direction will break your grip and then you'll break everything else."
1423,AskScienceFiction,[Black Panther] Why did T'Challa flex his tech in front of a bunch of black inner city American kids?,"""Flexing his tech"" wasn't the point, it was to go to the place where his cousin grew up. And show his companions the outreach center he was opening."
1424,AskScienceFiction,[MCU] Did the US Government have a legal right to ask Tony Stark to give up the Iron Man suit?,"Actively taking the intellectual property from him? They could claim eminent domain, I assume, but that would be a fight.

Prohibiting him from using it? 100% within the powers of the federal government. ITAR would cover Tony using the suit outside of the US, and there is plenty of precident for the federal government banning certain kinds of weapons from private ownership or use. His ability to fly is also very likely in violation of FAA regulations."

Aliens: Humanity became a spacefaring species shortly after

1429,AskScienceFiction,[Harry Potter] Did the Dursley's have plans for what to do with Harry long-term? Were they planning to keep him as a basement slave for the rest of their lives? Were they going to kick him out when he became too old and disavow all knowledge of him? What were they actually thinking?,"Keep him alive until he's 17. That was the only thing they cared about.

Dumbledore's letter when he left Harry was short but to the point. Petunia and Vernon were far from the most knowledgeable muggles, but Petunia had been familiar with the wizarding world for nearly a decade by that point and Vernon was well aware of its existence. Despite their determination to avoid all things magical, a letter detailing how your sister and brother-in-law were just killed by Wizard Hitler and kicking your orphaned nephew (who also just defeated Wizard Hitler) out of the house before he's 17 will make you a target for all of his followers is the sort of thing that puts the fear of God in you. So they did what they had to and nothing more. Keep him alive with a roof over his head.  

Once Voldemort returned Harry was on borrowed time with the Dursleys. Petunia and Vernon received several updates from Dumbledore himself warning of dire consequences should they kick Harry out before he's 17 but by that point they really had no choice in what to do with Harry. While Dudley and Petunia may have grown a bit attached to Harry over the years, once the Order showed up prior to his birthday to evacuate him and get them all into hiding, they were pretty much ready to be rid of him."
1430,AskScienceFiction,[MCU] Are Asgardians a joke when it comes to military power?,"Thor had never heard of the Chitauri before. He said they were ""not of Asgard, nor of any known world"". Loki knew this and was banking on their obscurity to protect them. 

But space is ridiculously big and encompasses a lot more than the Nine Realms. Rocket's traveling companion Groot was unknown among the Xandarians, so seems he's gone off the beaten path before.

For all we know, though,  Rocket learned about the Chitauri weakness from stories of the Avengers defeating them. He said that in 2019, 7 years after it happened."

1432,AskScienceFiction,[Avatar: The Last Airbender] Everyone keeps telling me I shouldn't drink soda because it doesn't hydrate at all and it's sugary garbage. So here's my question: can Waterbenders sodabend?,"Sugary drinks absolutely do hydrate you. If you had an unlimited amount of coke in the dessert for a month, but no water, you’d be way better drinking the coke than nothing. There is way more water in soft drinks than the minimum amount to counteract the water needed to digest the sugar. It’d basically have to be a thick syrup to be so little water that it actually dehydrates you."

1435,AskScienceFiction,[Frozen] How can Prince Hans get his coup off the ground?,"Anna was, according to the script, 18 during the events of Frozen (here's the Disney wiki [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Anna#cite\_ref-:0\_5-0](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Anna#cite_ref-:0_5-0)). As such, she is indeed the queen if Elsa abdicates, and one could make a very solid case that refusing to take part in your coronation, throwing away your crown, hiding in the mountains and refusing to come back is a *de facto* abdication.

If Elsa *had* abdicated at that point, Anna was queen. As such, her appointing Hans caretaker ruler is a royal decree. And if she dies, this gives Hans some degree of political authority to declare himself leader based on the late queen's wishes- especially since, with Anna's death, the direct line of succession seems to have ended.

Like, drinking water is technically important but he doesn't flip a coin on the matter, he has no conflict about the action. Whether or not to have a snack mid-afternoon isn't very important at all, even if he's conflicted about the matter, so he probably won't flip a coin but will just choose one way or the other like a regular person."

It’s wielded as an extension of the ancient power inherent to the world. Gandalf as a wizard is of a superior class of beings that are older and know of the old rules. 

It’s not a school of magic or a spell, it is Gandalf enforcing his will over the Balrog and the world local to the bridge. He isn’t casting a ward or a rune or anything he is simply tapping into his natural power and announcing that YOU. SHALL. NOT. PASS."

1441,AskScienceFiction,"[DC] When Lanterns use their rings to make guns, do they have to visualize every single bullet they fire or is it a subconscious manifestation of their creation?","Essentially, both.

The ring creates what you imagine. If you imagine a shape with another shape shooting out of it, that's what the construct will be. If you imagine the mechanical workings of a gun down to the threads on every screw, the resulting construct will match that complexity. The trade-off tends to be that more complex constructs are stronger or more robust, while also requiring more concentration to manifest. But you can strengthen a less-complex construct through sheer force of will, as well.

Hal Jordan is rather famous for making giant fists or boxing gloves and overpowering his opponents through sheer force of will, for example, while Kyle Rayner (**EDIT**: And John Stewart!) is famous for intricate constructs that model very fine details. Both are effective ring-slingers and neither approach is fundamentally better than the other in all situations.

1443,AskScienceFiction,[Doctor Who] I'm being chased by a Weeping Angel so I go out into some deep water. Am I safe?,"I'm not sure if Angels turn to stone if *any* lifeform looks at it. Considering they can move around outside, and outside has all sorts of animals roaming about, I'm guessing it doesn't work for every creature. So an Angel might not turn to stone in the water from being seen by, say, fishes. Since they are shaped like people, they should be able to swim. Once looked at, they will of course turn to stone again, causing them to sink. Once it sinks deep enough to be out of view, it will turn back to normal and start swimming again until it's back into view and turns to stone, ad infinitum. 

This is assuming that you will spot it every time it comes back up. The angel might try swimming up behind you.

However, another option for the angel is to just wait on land. You might be safe for a while, but eventually you're going to have to leave the water. It is a temporary solution at best."

It's important to remember that adamantium, for all its indestructibility, is *toxic*.  Not the sort of thing you should be lacing bones with.  A good chunk of Logan's healing factor was going into staving off the effects of adamantium poisoning.  So when it was suddenly removed, not only do you have an already-powerful mutant suddenly a good couple dozen kilograms lighter, you also have an already-powerful healing factor shot into comparative overdrive.

In particular, her ""adamantium"" claws aren't particularly durable, and her ""visor"" wouldn't be able to block Scott's optic blasts. She can control the rigidity of her creations, at least to an extent, so I imagine she could form claws that are as tough and sharp as normal bone could be, but that's it.

And no, she can't take off the clothes she mimics; doing so would be an amputation, and incredibly painful."

1454,AskScienceFiction,[Avatar: LOK and TLAB] How long after Avatar Wan’s death did it take before the Avatar was actually taken seriously as a force to be reckoned with?,"The Avatar isn't always taken seriously; it depends mostly on the current Zeitgeist and the success of previous Avatars. For example,  by the time of Kyoshi, people weren't super enthusiastic about Kuruk, but treated Yangchen as a literal god.

If anything I would say the earliest Avatars were taken more seriously than the later ones, if only because knowledge of Raava was eventually lost for the most part. Kinda hard to argue the Avatar is just a powerful bender when they are bonded with the Literal God-Spirit of Good."

1458,AskScienceFiction,[Logan] How is the Adamantium skeleton poisoning Wolverine?,"Metal poisoning works differently from other poisons. No matter how well you heal, you can't  metabolize metal. Some of it can be filtered out by your kidneys, but most of that metal will remain in your system, accumulating in your organs, and never leaving. 

It's likely that the accumulation of Adamantium in his soft tissues didn't reach a level where it was actually toxic for a very long time, and once it did reach those levels, his HF had to work all the time just to keep up with the damage. As more accumulates, the less his healing can do to  counteract it, and eventually it overwhelms his healing Factor altogether, doing more damage faster than it can be healed, and leading to aging because his HF no longer has the spare resources to prevent it."

1470,AskScienceFiction,"[Superman/DC] If the US government maintained a firm stance that Superman was an illegal immigrant (didn’t apply for asylum?

For Superman/Kal-el it actually would not matter if he was here illegally. There is precedent where if someone is here while their home nation is dissolved, they can not be deported back, because the nation they came from does not exist anymore. There have been several examples of this in our history. Imagine a refugee arrived here from Czechoslovakia in 1992, but then it dissolves and splits into the Czech Republic and Slovakia 6 months later. Neither new nation recognizes the refugee as a citizen, and we literally can not send them back to Czechoslovakia.

In Superman's case: Krypton is gone. Even if he were willing to leave or go along with it, he literally can not be deported back. Now, that doesn't mean he would be given citizenship. Just that he likely would be allowed to remain in in the US. And even if some bitter officials were super gung ho about exiling him and kicking him out, I'm sure plenty other nations would offer him asylum immediately. I could see Superman playing along with it until the US inevitably needs him again and formally apologizes."

1482,AskScienceFiction,[Batman] Goon here. Which of these lunatics in Halloween costumes should I throw my lot in with?,"Ok, real talk, there is a *lot* of mundane crime going on outside the freak gallery. The assorted dregs of Arkham are doing their shenanigans on top of an entire normal city's worth of crime, it's just easy to lose track of the regular stick-ups and hustles when the freeze rays and giggle bombs get all the press. Consider either making you own action, or hooking up with more conventional crime, like Carmine Falcone's outfit; it will be a lot more like the action that you're used to, and involve less working with nutcases.

If you must work with the freaks, top ones are probably going to be Penguin, Black Mask and Two-Face, in that order. Penguin and Black Mask are essentially the edge cases between the nutcases and the conventional criminals, since aside from some gimmicks they're more or less running normal mobs. Dent is similar, but the craziness compromises things more, influencing decision making and discipline decisions; he will not always do the right or smart thing, but he will do what that coin tells him, which will lead to trouble.

Bane is... tricky. For the most part he's a skilled operator, but he also favors very high risk, high reward operations, often without a goal that translates well into profitability. If taking over cities sounds dope, give him a call, but if you just want to get paid, look elsewhere. 

After that, you're playing with real dangerous fire. Most of the ""stable"" ones have some sort of objective that they would happily kill every one of their henchmen to achieve. Poison Ivy and Mister Freeze more or less have their heads screwed on straight when it comes to actual strategy, but they're both full-throttle psychos in the pursuit of their goals, and they will throw you away in a second if it gets them one step closer to the finish line.

Below that, you get to the layer where your boss is as much of a hazard as the cops. Scarecrow sees ""goon"" as a synonym for ""lab rat"", and your criminal career might end with permanent brain damage and perpetual waking nightmares of being locked in a box with (insert childhood fear here).  And the Joker...

...ok, real talk, if you're willing to roll some dice and get out when the getting is good, there's potential with the Joker. He runs good heists, brings in plenty of cash, and generally pays well. But every time you walk in that door, you're playing Russian Roulette; he could be in a bad mood, he could be in a good mood (and want to hand out free neurotoxins to celebrate), he could find you annoying, or not funny, or *too* funny, or think you're staring at his girl's but, or think you're *not* staring at his girl's butt and you think she's ugly, and so on. If you go this route, get in, get the cash, keep your luggage in the trunk of your car and be ready to *run like hell* before it all goes wrong."

2. [Loki vs Valkyrie](https://youtu.be/6lJaXlJ36L8?t=212) in *Thor: Ragnarok*. Valkyrie can throw a regular human-sized being about 500m and can leap that far herself. Yet Loki holds his own for a bit and is able to gain enough advantage to reveal her tattoo and cast a spell on her.


3. And of course he [tosses Captain America around like a pre-schooler](https://youtu.be/JcgJvJqCdrw?t=137). Cap, who can  [kick a truck](https://youtu.be/3RNCU9f4da4?t=82).


4. Even after Loki takes [this beating from the Hulk](https://youtu.be/31ZjnrHR8EA?t=46), he's up and walking around in a few minutes with no ill effects.

In a way, there was very little logic to it, Skynet just took a very human gamble out of fear.

1489,AskScienceFiction,[The Matrix Trilogy] Why didn't The Machines just patch all of the bugs and exploits that allowed Neo to do Superman stuff and Agent Smith to completely assimilate the entire human crop?,"You remember the Architect? The Colonel Sanders looking guy who is the embodiment of [sesquipedalian loquaciousness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness)?

Turns out he addresses your core issue here. I imagine most people just kind of drone out over most of his speech, and it is unfortunate that they had this information given in perhaps the most arcane manner possible. Exposition drops are bad enough as it is, but it's almost as if they didn't want people paying attention. Anyway, here are some relevant bits:

>*""Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision.""*

Remember that the machines do not, fundamentally, understand humans. The first version of the Matrix was a paradise that almost everyone rejected, to their own demise. The 1999 version isn't perfect either. While it contents most people, you still have those that ""wake up"" from it, even on their own. To address one of your questions: ""Why don't they 'patch' it?"" They're trying, but despite their efforts to counter-act the emergence of ""The One"", he still appears. In fact, they shifted from solely trying to prevent his occurrence, to anticipating it and attempting to control it when it appears:

>*""While it remains a burden to sedulously avoid it, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.""*

Ok, but is this satisfactory? I mean seems simple. If you want humans to have a max speed, cap their speed. If you don't want them to be able to fly, don't give them the ability to fly. What gives?

Well, remember that the entire point of the Matrix is to create an environment where humans can exist, and the first attempt failed. Success required an understanding of humans that eluded the machines:

>*""The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being, thus I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche.""*

""The Oracle""

Her sole purpose was to understand humans, which perhaps resulted in her seemingly prescient abilities to ""predict"" their behavior and, thus, the future.

Her solution?

>*""\[S\]he stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99.9% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level.""*

Free Will. Humans need some element of Free Will. That limits the ability of the machines to cap their powers.^(\*) Successive application of free will, at an unconscious level, however can, over time, lead to the ""exploits"" we see:

>*""While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked, would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.""*

Thus the machines are in a situation where they need to allow for this imperfection to ensure the viability of the Matrix as a whole, but this imperfection, compounded over time, results in the emergence of ""The One"" that threatens the system. Yet this emergence is predictable. Rather than try to prevent it, they exploit it:

>*""The function of the One is now to return to the source... After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals, 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.""*

Basically the Matrix *allows* Zion to exist as extortion material to force ""The One"" to basically reset everything. In short, when the problem of ""The One"" gets out of hand, they rebuild everything from scratch (which is why the Matrix is seemingly always in the late 1990s).

\* - It perhaps bears expanding on why Free Will limits the ability of the Machines to cap people's powers. There are many ways the machine could limit someone's ability. For example, Neo can move fast. So one way would be to check how fast someone is moving and if their speed would exceed a certain amount, set their speed to the max.

But this is a somewhat ""artificial"" limitation. It's like having a governor on a car. You press the gas pedal all the way to the floor, zoom up to 60 mph, and the car suddenly stops going faster. These ""artificial"" limitations would eventually be perceived through trial and error, revealing the illusion of the Matrix and defeating its purpose *as* an illusion.

Instead, machines can only limit people the way the real-world does, through the basic rules of physics, which then govern the rules of chemistry, biology, and ultimately the physical and mental limitations of your ""body."" But controlling this with a simple, deterministic, equation prevents Free Will and, thus, failure.

So the fundamental equations that govern the Matrix must be non-deterministic. They must allow for choice and, therefore, cannot prevent people from accessing abilities beyond what the Matrix might want."

1496,AskScienceFiction,[LOTR] This is definitely a stupid question but I’m a little drunk and at the end of the ext. LOTR 2 but why are the heroes still alive after the battle of Rohan? Were they blessed or lucky or just better warriors than the hundreds of age old elves that trained for like a million years that died?,"If we go by the movie, which we shall in this case since the Elves are mentioned:

1. Elves probably don't spend all their lives training, and in all honesty, Elves do not have the best record of staying alive in battle despite training all those years.  
2. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are royalty or close to royalty, with enormous amounts of combat experience and probably even higher-than-average training.  Aragorn, for example, pretty much went to every realm of Man, spent much of that time leading armies and fighting enemies under a different name.  Gimli's got a pretty martial tradition as a Dwarf from Erebor, and before that the Iron Hills.  Legolas is Thranduil's son, so I'd expect pretty good training.
3. You'd expect the commander and commander's guard to be protected.  Theoden, for example, would definitely not come out until it was desperate (as was the case), but Aragorn seemed to be in command of the Elves, and it's probably safe to assume that Gimli and Legolas would be unofficially his guards.  In a lot of ancient and medieval battles, a commander's personal guard can serve as an elite unit, and would be deployed at the crux of a fight.
4. A lot of Elves and Men did make it out, I think, or at least there were quite a few retreating into the keep.  Many probably died fighting in there while the King and the heroes retreated into the last rooms, or moved into the mountains to act as a rearguard."
1497,AskScienceFiction,[Star Wars] What was the prophecy that Qui Gon and Obi believed in? What was its origin and was it actually wrong?,"The actual word for word prophecy was:

*""A Chosen One shall come, born of no father, and through him will ultimate balance in the Force be restored.""*

It's origins are simply an ancient Jedi mystic. It's not really clear who said it or how they came to claim it. Further, somehow from this 1 sentence it was also ascertained that the Chosen One would destroy the Sith. I think the Jedi inferred this because it's what they think will lead to balance.

Anakin Skywalker *is* the Chosen One, and he *did* fulfill the prophecy, but the Force works in strange ways, and predictions about the future made through visions from the Force are... not unreliable, but they're sort of like Genie wishes. They often don't pan out how you'd expect. Ultimate balance in the Force *was* restored, and the Sith destroyed, but that doesn't mean that the dark side is destroyed, or that there will be no more conflicts between the dark and the light. What did happen though is this: The dark side was no longer disproportionately in control of the Galaxy. The light side was no longer obstructed or clouded by the dark side. The now misshapen and bloated Jedi order was swept away.

Essentially, what the Jedi thought would happen is the Chosen One would rise through the ranks, destroy the Sith, and lead the Jedi into an era of prosperity and clear purpose once more. What ended up happening though, is that the Force was cleansed by fire. What was there could not be fixed. The Sith had too deep roots, too many back up plans, to be simply overthrown. The Jedi were too misguided, too self-righteous to ever get back on their original path.

 But total destruction of both sides, now that balances the scales."
1498,AskScienceFiction,[Star wars] What is preventing me to make a light saber with a really really long blade?,"So, in the new cannon, the death star is powered by kyber crystals, the same thing that powers lightsabers.

1505,NoStupidQuestions,Why do people wear shoes in the house?,"I think that this is more common in places where they don't get much snow or rain, like California.  In Canada we always take off our shoes so as not to track dirt and mud around the house.  It's not a hard cultural rule like it is in Japan, but more of a practical necessity.  It's also common to have a different pair of shoes in the office, than the boots that you are wearing walking around outside."

1507,NoStupidQuestions,"When leaving the house, does anyone tell their pets they will be home later?","Every single time.

They are pretty old, so over the years they seem to understand the difference in time between 'Store' and 'Work'.

Store is reserved for anything under an hour.

Work is when we will be gone for over an hour or more.

When we say, 'We're going to work, we'll see you soon.' They sit in other spots."

1513,NoStupidQuestions,"How come governments can be so openly corrupt, everybody knows it, a lot ridicule it, yet nothing ever happens?",People generally don't take action on something unless they're being directly affected.

1515,NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone go through a vicious loop of being productive & having a great routine for a few days to living like an absolute slob for the next few... rinse and repeat?,"Yes and i've found it better to forgive myself for being unproductive some days. Being hard on myself only makes me more likely to extend the unproductive phase.

Also, unpopular opinion maybe, but we are allowed to not be productive every now and then. There's no moral failing there."
1516,NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else think Google search quality has gone downhill fast?,"Yes. I now have to go to the second page, which was something that I haven't had the need of doing since I first started using Internet.

1520,NoStupidQuestions,"Why is it that Presidential elections always feel like choosing between the ""lesser of two evils"" and not ""the better of two good candidates""?","Because your country runs on a first-past-the-post system. Only a single person can be elected and that person is whoever gets the most votes, so it makes sense for ideologically aligned people to pool their resources and present a single person instead of all trying to win and losing to a different unified party.   
This is why endorsements from the same party exist and why third party candidates can never win more than a few percentage points."
1521,NoStupidQuestions,Are men really that much stronger than women?,"I know some people have been acting like OP is silly for asking, but I don’t think every man actually understands. I remember trying to fight a guy off when I was a teenager, we were the same age and the situation got uncomfortable, I kept pushing him and trying to pull myself away, and I don’t think he even understood that I was doing everything I could to get away. I’ve also heard of trials where it’s argued that the women didn’t fight hard enough, but as hard as you can might not even be hard enough to notice with a man with tunnel vision. 

We need to have these conversations because it’s dangerous to pretend we all know or even worse that we’re equally matched."
1522,NoStupidQuestions,Is Russia truly doing such a poor job in the invasion of Ukraine or are we just being fed propaganda?,"I think it is because they were believed to have a dominant military, and they are struggling compared to what the world's expectations were."

1524,NoStupidQuestions,Has google search gotten less accurate in anyone else’s opinion? In the sense that I’ll google something and often have to go to the second page to find the result to get past what look like ads. Even Wikipedia is often on the second page instead of the first result now?,"I actually noticed this happen to me for YouTube. I'd look for something and could hardly find what I'm looking for, so I click on a video that's close but not exactly what I want, and then I find what I want in the related videos (with the keywords i searched!)

This only started happening recently, like maybe the recent weeks or months. I wonder if anyone else experienced this lately?"
1525,NoStupidQuestions,Why do billionaires and other very rich individuals try so hard to avoid paying taxes when they will still be rich whether they pay the taxes or not?,"This is a complicated question. Let me first start by sayin that most of the ultra wealthy have wealth through assets, either physical property or stock ownership NOT through income. When we say Musk is worth 200B, most of that is assets. His liquid wealth, while still substantial, is likely much much smaller, maybe a few hundred million. You also must understand that money is not the same to the wealthy as it is to us. Money for them is a tool used to create more wealth. Anything which diminishes that tool must be minimized in order to maximize the usefulness of the tool. Basically we have a few motivating factors here, one is the desire to sustain a lavish lifestyle utilizing a much smaller amount of liquid assets, so paying 25% of 300 million will actually lower their ability to own all those fancy houses and yachts and rub elbows with politicians and officials. Second, is the desire to utilize wealth to productively to make more wealth. While a few million less may not be substantial, those few million may be worth 10x or 100x if properly invested, so the pain of that tax is many times multiples. Third the desire to avoid taxes on assets which is a whole separate discussion around property rights, but when 98% percent of your worth is in assets, you sure don’t want that to happen."
1526,NoStupidQuestions,We just got flaming hot cheetos here in New Zealand. Do normal human beings actually eat these?,"Get a nice burn going from the hot cheetos. Next, chug down an ice cold soda. You'll be able to briefly see into the future"
1527,NoStupidQuestions,"How true is this, ""Most people would rather work with someone who's mediocre at their job, but pleasant to be around, than a person who's exceptionally good, but a dick""?","Yep!  I work in IT and I'm on a lot of interview panels, and we don't actually even look for IT skills at all (for customer-facing positions), because it's so much easier to teach someone good computer skills than it is to teach someone good people skills."
1528,NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else get unreasonably self conscious about how fast their windshield wipers are going compared to other cars during a rainstorm?,"No, I'm too busy judging that weirdo in the next lane because his wipers are so fast."
1529,NoStupidQuestions,How are people not sick and tired of superhero movies yet?,"It’s called “Superhero Fatigue” or “Comic Fatigue” and it actually **is** a growing thing. While box offices / viewerships are typically still healthy for such  products, there is a noticeable increase in critical opinions of those same products, indicating that while such films or shows are being watched, they are being enjoyed less."
1530,NoStupidQuestions,"If women want real pockets in their clothing, why don’t some company just do as they say and make a shit ton of profit?","Some do. All of my bottoms are from American Eagle or Athleta, and both brands make functional pockets. They may be in the minority, but there are options. The ones that still don’t give women pockets may do it because they can’t figure out how to make pockets that don’t make the pants look bulky."

1532,NoStupidQuestions,What does dying feel like?,"You probably won't be hungry or thirsty much for the last two weeks, and can expect some incontinence towards the end as well. You won't have to worry too much, eating nothing and drinking nothing will lead to less waste when that does (if it does.)

Some people report an overwhelming sense of peace before the end. I hope this is true for you. I hope you have a safe passage and wonderful journey."
1533,NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else just “stare into the void” and let everything go blurry?,"Yes, I call it ‘staring into space’ tho."
1534,NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else get to the end of a movie and realize they never learned a single character’s name? Or forget every single character name within 5 minutes of walking out of the theatre?,"I read whole novels where, despite seeing the characters name every time they speak, I still only know who they are by context."
1535,NoStupidQuestions,If gas got too high and electric cars are expensive what’s stopping me from using a horse and carriage?,Probably the cost of keeping and caring for a horse
1536,NoStupidQuestions,Why do people always ask where we go after death but no one ever asks where we were before we were born and had a conciousness?,It’s easier to accept that we can be created but much harder to accept that one day we won’t exist.

1539,NoStupidQuestions,"Because of a tik toc trend, my sons school closed all the bathrooms. Is this legal?","Lots of schools are doing this.

1540,NoStupidQuestions,Has anyone else noticed the huge decrease in result quality from google?,The worst thing for me is when I include a word and Google is then tellibg me the result does not contain said word... Thanks Google but there is a reason why I entered it. So please search for it as well
1541,NoStupidQuestions,Why are jokes about alopecia for women considered rude but male pattern baldness is just accepted as a common thing to make fun of?,"I don't support it, but the reason is probably that women's worth and value are tied much more closely to how conventionally attractive they are, which includes long hair. Men can still have value and worth even with no hair, while an ugly woman is often told to just go kill herself.  Read any social media if you don't believe me."
1542,NoStupidQuestions,Does anybody else just feel absolutely empty inside after finishing a really good show or movie?,Yes. Its because the happiness we got from reading or watching whatever is now over. Its basically grieving.
1543,NoStupidQuestions,"Does anyone else waste a few hours, feel guilty about it, then proceed to waste the entire day without guilt because the day was already wasted because of those few wasted hours?",I'm in the middle of studying for a masters degree and this sums me up pretty well.

1544,NoStupidQuestions,"Why do people in the Star Wars universe think that the Jedi are myths or use the term ""the legends say..."" when there was an entire branch of the government run by Jedi less than 20 years ago?","You've got a few factors to consider. 

1) there are literally more inhabited planets than there are active Jedi at their highest strength. Even during the Republic, 99% of citizens never saw a Jedi in person, and 99.99999% of those same citizens never saw the Jedi use any powers. The average citizen of the Republic was probably pretty skeptical of the Jedi actually having powers, and instead suspected that they were just leaning on legends of their powers to conduct their diplomatic missions. Sure, maybe the Jedi had powers long ago, but these days you're pretty skeptical of the whole thing.

2) the Empire, which controls virtually all interplanetary communications through the Holo-net, set about eradicating every record of the Jedi's power and influence. Where they couldn't erase stuff, they set about gas lighting the population about the corruption and fraud that was rife in the Jedi order, to the point that most people would believe that the Jedi had been tricking the Republic before Palpatine came along to save it.

3) anyone that had concrete info about the Jedi knew to keep their heads down and play along, or risk attracting the attention of the Empire and Vader's efforts to eradicate the remaining Jedi. This fear of openly discussing them would cause the Jedi to quickly fall into legends."

1547,NoStupidQuestions,"My brother died in a power line accident, did it hurt?","Two things about electricity: it travels at almost the speed of light, and communication from the body to the brain is done with electricity. When he was electrocuted, his brain was overwhelmed by an electrical response from the power line that was much stronger than the body can emit to tell the brain it is feeling pain. Such a high voltage striking a person would disrupt these systems permanently, at least until he died. He was likely brain dead seconds after being electrocuted. Which means he felt no pain despite burning as he would have died from the electricity far before the fire killed him. People aren’t just saying it was instant to make you feel better, it really was.

**These are cherry-picked excerpts and I have left a great deal out.  Go read the articles for yourself.  This post is meant to help frame part of the question, not an attempt to answer it.**  
  
MONSTERS, INC.: A Concise History of Sex Offender Laws  
http://oncefallen.com/history.html  
  
>Prior to 1870, sex crimes were rarely depicted in the media, but in the 1880s, to sensational stories help to cement our fascination with the “sex killer” – HH Holmes and Jack the Ripper. The term “Ripper” was used to stereotype sex offenders for many years to come. With this sudden fascination with serial killers and “sex fiends” came increase reports from the media, peaking in the early 1910s. During this time, the modern stereotype of the sex offender as a dirty old man/stranger on the prowl to seduce children with toys were candy was already starting to take shape (Jenkins p. 34-38).  
  
>The 1930s was a time of unparalleled economic and instability, so it is little surprise that a series of high profile cases helped create an appearance of a violent crime wave. Sensationalized cases such as The Lindbergh baby kidnapping, the Cleveland Torso Killings, and Albert Fish solidified the fears over “sex killers”. The prominence of a national media helped to make previously localized crimes a nationwide concern (Jenkins p. 49-52). As a result of these laws, a number of reactionary laws and strategies designed to handle the perceived crime wave, including civil commitment laws, lists of known sex offenders, and castration laws were introduced (Jenkins p. 80-82, Leon p. 46).  
  
>[In the 1950s to 1980s] Skepticism of the justice system eventually extended to rehabilitation efforts. Rehabilitation was seen as a myth, and a paradigm shift to a punitive “just desserts” doctrine was propagated by the government (Jenkins p.112-113). The Gay Rights Movement also fueled fears of “pedophile rings”, and the newly formed “Moral Majority” used these fears as anti- gay rhetoric until the AIDS epidemic provided a better avenue for exploiting public fears (Jenkins p.124-125). Pornography and obscenity as a cause for sexual deviancy became a primary focus in the 1970s, and a number of unconfirmed (i.e., bogus) statistics were cited to justify this fear (Jenkins p.145-147).  
  
>In 1990, the sensational trial of Earl K. Shriner led Washington State to pass a comprehensive “sexual predator” law. Washington’s legislature passed sex offender registry and community notification laws, and long-term indefinite sentences coupled with civil commitment laws (Jenkins p.191-192). The view of the sex offender as an uncontrollable monster than cannot be cured but contained supported an “anything goes” approach to dealing with sex offenders. While this idea was not unique to this era, the unanimous support and widespread dissemination of laws are unique to the Containment Era (Leon p.113-114).  
  
>Registration and community notification laws made the public participants in the supervision of sex offenders. This is a very dangerous precedent. Sex offenders became targets of overt acts of vigilantism. Family members of those impacted by these laws and even victims were endangered by sex offender laws. These actions have been justified by the perceived extreme harm caused by offenders, their immunity to treatment and reform, and the danger posed to children (Jenkins p.199-200, Leon p.183-185).  
  
>Each wave of predator panic has held the same basic belief—the image of the sex offender as an “incurable” “monster” complete with ominous-sounding terms like “sex fiends”, “sexual psychopaths”, and “sexual predators”. The monster mantra justifies novel approaches to addressing sex crimes to isolate and contain the sex offender. On the opposite end of the spectrum is the wave of skepticism that follows a collapse of the monster paradigm. The pendulum swings between the sex offender as a nuisance or sick but treatable person and the incurable monster, though the pendulum tends to spend more time on the incurable monster side of the spectrum."

The main concern is that some people claiming to be anti-fascist are basically claiming anyone they disagree with to be a legitimate target. It is not like the fascists among us wear uniforms with badges on. There is no one single ""antifa"" movement which complicates things, as does some people labeling everyone *they* disagree with as antifa as a reason to dismiss their views or suggest they are automatically violent. What a mess."
1555,NoStupidQuestions,"Why are a lot white people super sensitive towards racism towards blacks, but then don’t care about racism towards Asians, Indians, etc?",Depends on which white culture you hail from. The US is super sensitive aabout black racism. here in the UK we are extremely sensitive about indian or pakistani racism. It depends on your culture history and what its ...embarassments are.
1556,NoStupidQuestions,Why is American higher education seen as the world's gold standard yet American secondary education is viewed so poorly?,"I'm surprised no one mentioned the financial aspect of this, the gold standard OP is referring to is in regard to the well-established Universities in the US which have a significantly higher budget and resources available for both research and infrastructure. Their tuition is higher, the donations from other sources and funding they receive are higher when compared to any other country. Furthermore, the universities in the US attract faculty, talent, and students from all over the globe.

On the other hand, the secondary public school system in the US in many cases is run by state which allocates low budget, to begin with, and they receive very minimal funding from other sources if any. Often the public schools don't have the infrastructure to support the students and in some cases, they cannot compensate their staff well enough. But the secondary education systems of countries that are rated at the top are funded very well from their respective federal budgets."

1558,NoStupidQuestions,Why is body positivity focused on fat people instead of amputees and people with scars?,"Originally the body positivity movement was mostly for the anatomical differences not relating to weight: face deformities, amputees, scars, stretch marks etc. But then the movement expanded to things such as height and weight as we became more open-minded as a community. Regarding overweight people, it was sort of highjacked, whether you were overweight or underweight it was about accepting who you are, as an individual not as a collective to help with body dysmorphia and that just because your body isn’t model-material you are still worth it. That isn’t to say they are healthy or unhealthy, it’s just about being comfortable. It wasn’t about promoting “this is what everyone should look like” which is what you’re referring to via “obesity is healthy” it is about saying I like how I look, that’s it. Just a small minority has taken the movement too far."

1561,NoStupidQuestions,Am I the only one who thinks I look pretty decent when I look in the mirror and I like how I look but then I look absolutely disgusting in picture and videos?,"This happens A LOT because of the distance from the subject and the other specifics affecting the outcome of the picture. Basically certain lenses, light conditions, and angle/distance from the camera can make your face look shallower, and others deeper, others longer, etc.  [Here is a pretty great example, sums it up better than words.](http://www.danvojtech.cz/blog/wp-content/uploads/cover25-1200x400.jpg)

I've worked in the fashion industry (on the production side) and for photoshoots the model is pretty much the least of our concerns, as lights, the equipment, the weather, EVERYTHING influences how pretty a person will look. If the photographer or the equipment is shit, there's no way in hell the pic will look good without a bunch of digital editing.

Which brings me to my final point... don't ever ever compare yourself to models/celebrities on social media. Just because people use social media like Instagram on their phones, it doesn't mean those pretty selfies were taken with a phone camera. Pretty much every single pic posted by celebrities/models is run through their personal digital editors or photography agencies, to ensure that simple Sunday lunch pic looks good enough to be a Vogue cover.

EDIT: thanks for the awards! I stand corrected on the lens comment I made, by many professionals that provided insight on the subject. Please don't downvote them, I was incorrect about the lenses. Added more info on other things that I know can distort pic results. Also forgive incorrect terminology, english is not my first language and I'm not a professional photographer.

1574,NoStupidQuestions,why is vaginia called a commonwealth when other states arent?,"They spoke about this in The Economist this week.

After the USA rebelled against Britain, there were many examples of Americans doing things to mark themselves as a distinct nation. Having carriages go on the right side of the road was one of them. As for the states, some (four) of them opted to be called commonwealth rather than states to emphasise their independence from the British monarch.

You can see this in the name. Commonwealth means a political community created for the common good. That means the legitimacy of the government is based on the consent of the common people rather than the (British) crown.

Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia were all British colonial possesses before 1776. Hence, they were also the ones that opted for commonwealth to make clear the new separation."

How did it come to this?","I live in The Netherlands so I have not really an idea about the cause for this in the USA, but for my country the situation is the same, people in their 20-40's are not able to buy a home, over here it is caused by investors who buy houses as an investment, rent them out and making money while the people who rent the homes cannot save money.

Another cause of the problem is that there are not enough houses for the population. During the financial crisis projects where cancelled and many of the workforce lost their job, whole company's went bankrupt, causing a lasting shortage of people with the skills to build houses.

Next cause is the fact that our government invented a special Tax for organizations who build houses for the lower class. So these organizations are bleeding and have no funds to either renovate their old houses or build new ones.

Also a few of these organizations (Vesta) went almost bankrupt as a result of fraud. To prevent their bankruptcy they had to sell a large part of their affordable houses, to, see point one, investors.

And las t but not least, the so called gentrification of the poorer parts of large cities. Older small but affordable houses are demolished to build larger but more expensive apartments forcing a ""poor out, rich in"" effect.

If she's a lab then the fact that you exist creates a bond. They're generally *extremely* friendly dogs, so you don't have to actually do a whole lot other than feed her and she'll think you're awesome. Playing would be high on her list of things to do as well. Fetch will probably be her favorite activity since labs, and their cousins golden retrievers, absolutely *love* to bring things back to their person. She'll easily do that for as long as you want to throw a ball for her. Walks would be good too, though she'll probably want to stop and sniff everything that a squirrel or neighborhood cat has ever come near.

>Doggo is frightened and scared when I saw her. Finally got her to eat when I got on the floor, rolled over to show my belly.

The fact that you got her to calm down and eat is a great start. Good job!

Make sure you get her some toys if she doesn't already have any. Labs are smart and if they don't have something to do they'll get bored and can be destructive and start chewing on things. A nice dog bed would be a good idea as well, unless you don't mind her laying on your furniture or sleeping in bed with you. Even then, she might want her own place that's just for her."

1609,NoStupidQuestions,Why is it acceptable for a lot of Americans to kick their kids out of home as soon as they turn 18?,"I'm 30 now so it's been a while, but at least when I was a kid it was just a holdover from a time when it was more doable. I come from a blue collar family that never had a college graduate before my generation so nobody ever had debt to worry about, we lived in the rural Midwest where decent-to-high paying jobs in manufacturing and construction were easy to come by, housing in general was cheap, it was all in all just much easier to do when my parents were that age and even easier for my grandparents (all of whom also got married at that age).

The difference with me is that my little farming town absolutely fuckin *boomed* in population when I was growing up, and it coincided perfectly with the manufacturing jobs getting shipped out of town *and* the financial crash happening right as I graduated high school. I grew up expecting to leave when I was 18 but luckily my mom saw the writing on the wall and knew it wouldn't be possible by the time I was that age, so she let me stay as long as I was working. 

A lot of people in my area specifically (formerly rural, now suburban Midwest) weren't so lucky, and had way less flexible parents who basically told them to suck it up because it was easy for them so logically it'll be easy for you too. 

So I can't speak for America as a whole, but while it's really not nearly as common as it used to be, when it happens in mostly white areas that used to be pretty small, it's because it used to be easy thirty years ago and some people simply aren't willing to recognize how different the world is and just shove their kids off to ""be an adult"" before they have any reasonable chance of being self sufficient."

1612,NoStupidQuestions,"In a world where unimaginable amounts of money are moved around electronically every day, millions of online transactions are processed every minute, and I can pay my taxes, file returns, and renew my drivers license online - why is voting online “not safe” or insecure?","There are three things that must be true for voting:

1. It must be accurate- each voter must be able to vote exactly once and their vote must be correctly recorded
2. It must be anonymous- no one must be able to tell who voted for which candidate, so you can't be pressured to vote a particular way.
3. It must be verifiable- all sides involved must be able to verify that the first two things are true. You shouldn't need to trust anyone

The problem with online voting is number 3. There's no way to make sure that your vote is accurately recorded without being able to trace your individual vote. With traditional voting, there are observers seeing with their own eyes that things are being done correctly. But you can't observe an online vote. Even if I show you a computer program that counts votes correctly, there's no way for me to prove that the computer program running on the server is the same program I showed you, or that there isn't some other program off to the side messing with the data. 

The reason online banking works is because it doesn't care about being anonymous- every transaction you make is tied to your identity. You can see every transaction made in your name and verify them after the fact, even on the phone or in a brink and mortar bank if you don't trust the computer and you can contest any discrepancies. But that can't be allowed in voting.

EDIT: for those of you jumping at the bit to reply ""But Blockchain solves this"", please look at the replies to the other fifty people who have already brought that up."

We both loved how hideously tasteless it was. One day, one of us decided to hide it somewhere the other would find it (like under a cushion), and that was it - the game was on. 

It now gets hidden in increasingly unusual places, and the deal is that when you find it, you have to hide it again for the other person to find (without saying you found it). It’s followed us through three house moves, and has even gone abroad with us. It’s been behind the sink, in a winter coat that has been stored away over the summer, in a first-aid kit, at the back of the fridge, inside a teddy bear… you name it. Sometimes it’s found within days, sometimes it takes months. Sometimes it’s so long that we both forget where it’s hidden (it’s been about a year and a half since I’ve seen it now).

1636,NoStupidQuestions,Is anyone else having problems with watching movies and constantly having to do volume up and down because the dialogue is too quiet and the background music is too loud?,"You're watching movies that were released in 5.1 surround, but on a stereo system (like a TV, or computer speakers). The stereo system is doing a poor job of ""re-mixing"" the 5.1 sound for stereo. There's usually a setting for this on the TV or on the movie player (DVD player, games console, etc), usually called something like ""Speaker Setup"" or ""demux"" if it's a fancy player, and it'll let you choose between e.g. speakers, soundbar, headphones...

In a 5.1 movie mix, the dialogue is usually positioned in the front-centre speaker, because the dialogue is almost always happening on-screen and should take priority over anything else the audience hears. Music usually appears in the front-left and front-right speakers, and effects can come from anywhere. When a stereo system mixes those 5 speakers together, it usually just squashes the front-left and rear-left signals together, the front-right and rear-right signals together, applying ""compression"" to the signals. This isn't like MP3 compression, it's an audio effect that makes quiet sounds louder, but doesn't affect loud sounds. This is to make up for the fact that your TV speakers probably aren't as loud as the speakers in a cinema.

It then plays the centre signal across both speakers, but reduces the level of the centre signal to compensate for it now appearing in two speakers. And sometimes, the centre signal gets reduced too much, and is drowned out by the compressed music and effects, which results in the dialogue being hard to hear.

But like I say, your TV or player device or even things like VLC give you some control over how the 5.1 signal is mixed, and how much compression should be applied.

---

This is now my most popular comment ever. Thanks for all the upvotes, and kind strangers for the awards. Here's some FAQs from my inbox:

**I have a 5.1 surround system, and I still get this problem.**

Boost the volume of your centre speaker. Ideally, get your system calibrated. If it was an expensive system, the shop that sold it to you should do this for you. If it wasn't expensive, there are online guides and phone apps that will help you.

**But I thought audio compression made loud sounds quieter, not the other way around?**

There are two kinds of compressors. A _downward_ compressor is the more well-known, and people who are familiar with recording audio will be most familiar with downwards compressors. These do indeed work by attenuating the signal when it goes above a given threshold, i.e. making the loud sounds quieter. But they give a different character to the signal above the threshold, which is great for making a kick drum sound massive while ensuring that it doesn't clip the recorder, but it isn't what we want here. 

Since the signal from a DVD has already been recorded and mixed by a professional, we know that it sounds great, so we don't want to alter the peaks in the signal, we _only_ want to amplify the low level sounds. For that, we need an _upward_ compressor. This works exactly as I describe; by raising the level of signals below a given threshold, i.e. making quiet sounds louder. You hardly ever find them in recording studios, but they're very common in broadcast audio and in hi-fi devices, which is what you'd classify a DVD player as.

Note that upward compressors are not just downward compressors with make-up gain. They're a completely different circuit design or algorithm."

1639,NoStupidQuestions,"The submarine millionaires, they're all going to die aren't they?","If they were lucky, the thing imploded and they all died instantly.

1640,NoStupidQuestions,"Why do people say ""tuna fish"" when they don't say ""beef mammal"" or ""chicken bird""?","For me (hailing from the northeastern US), ""tuna fish"" suggests shredded tuna like from a can (usually mixed with mayo to form tuna salad). Any other form of tuna is just ""tuna"". There's no logic to that as far as I can see, just the usage I grew up with.

&#x200B;

\*\*EDIT:\*\* Did not expect this to become the top-rated comment. I'd like to point out that [other comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ijdde9/why_do_people_say_tuna_fish_when_they_dont_say/g3cv0au?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) suggest it might have something to do with influence from other Germanic languages specifically when it comes to canned tuna.

Maybe I'll also add that shredded tuna is also sometimes sold in plastic (I've brought this hiking because the leftover trash is a bit lighter / easier to compress) -- I think I'd still tend to call this ""tuna fish"".

&#x200B;

\*\*EDIT 2:\*\* I also did not know that the word ""tuna"" [also refers to a type of prickly pear fruit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ijdde9/why_do_people_say_tuna_fish_when_they_dont_say/g3djx7y?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and where I'm from it's uncommon to see any form of prickly pear. I'd tend to believe that the reason for the usage is independent of prickly pear considerations (if only because the proportion of Americans \[the whole usage apparently being an American thing judging from the comments\] living in prickly pear-producing regions has historically been small (though increasing in the last several decades)."

1652,NoStupidQuestions,"A friend said he was deathly allergic to garlic, right after eating a meal we made with a fuckload of garlic. He seems okay, should we still tell him?","Tell him.

Also, it's entirely possible that he's mistaken rather than exaggerating. Maybe the experiences that made him think he was allergic to garlic were actually triggered by a different ingredient he didn't realise was in the dish. Maybe (as others have said) his allergies have changed over time and he used to break out from a single bite, but no longer does. Maybe—and this is, sadly, not unusual—he sought help for his genuine medical issues and had the bad luck of encountering a quack who gave him the wrong answer to his problems. Maybe he did actually have symptoms in the past few days, but he misattributed it to something else and didn't tell you because he didn't realise it was your cooking. Maybe he did realise it was your cooking but he wasn't comfortable bringing it up!

Eggplants and tomatoes are both nightshade vegetables, and it's not unusual for someone to have a medical issue with nightshades as a whole rather than just one particular species. Onions and garlic are also in the same family (editing to clarify: same family as each other, not the same family as eggplant and tomatoes), so it makes sense for those reactions to go together as well."

1659,NoStupidQuestions,"Is the word ""fuck"" in ""fuck bitches, get money"" supposed to mean ""ignore"" or ""have sex with""?","It is almost certainly purposefully vague both because they're both intertwined. It's not a simple answer.

The phrase was *initially* popularized by Biggie Smalls in the song [""Get Money.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7AGFAcwY3U) The song is about being betrayed by a woman, but also how he enjoys women in much the same way. It's a consistent theme throughout his music. He talks about being misogynistic, while also legitimately being in love, while also being a victim himself because he falls in love with very flawed women, all together. The hook is ""Fuck bitches, get money"". This hook would infamously be mocked on 2Pac's diss song [""Hit Em Up.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qC3w3UUkU)

The best example of this (and maybe my favorite Biggie song) is [""Me and My Bitch""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rueScMSnRP4). At the start he says ""Me and my bitch"" like a young kid with an arm piece, bragging. Then he says ""Me and my bitch"" in the second verse, using bitch as an almost empowering term, like yeah she's a bad bitch who stands her ground and I like her for that. Then in the third verse, where he finds her murdered, he's crying ""Me and my bitch"", saying it ironically and painfully nostalgically because at this point he truly loved her *because* she was rough around the edges.

This is the same in ""Get Money."" He switches back and forth in the song. Some of the lines are about him fucking bitches, others about getting money, others about being betrayed by women (fuck bitches).

But it doesn't stop there. In 2005, Lil Wayne released [""Money On My Mind""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ffu7u9gvSU) on Tha Carter II in which the hook references the ""Fuck Bitches, Get Money"" line from the Biggie Song. This is where it became memed on the internet, and when it became reintroduced to the public, a decade later. And with this line, a lot of the context was lost, and nobody really knew which way it meant because when it first came out (and remember, even still today Biggie is one of the highest selling rap artists of all time along with OutKast, Kanye, Eminem, Tupac and others) specifically because of the reasons I mentioned above.

So, the answer is it's a double entendre on purpose. Neither one is the right answer. Thus, the genius of Christopher George Latore Wallace aka Notorious B.I.G.

>In a memoir, astronaut Michael Collins relates a story of a physician back in the Apollo era who recommended regular masturbation on long missions, lest astronauts develop prostate infections. The flight surgeon for Collins's moon mission ""decided to ignore that advice,"" and ignoring seems to have been the basic approach to the human sex drive ever since. It's the same way at the Russian space agency. Cosmonaut Alexandr Laveikin told me he too had heard that lengthy abstinence could cause prostate infections, but that the space agency pretends the issue doesn't exist. ""It's up to yourself how you will deal with it. But everybody is doing it, everybody understands. It's nothing. My friends ask me, 'how are you making sex in space?' I say, 'By hand!'"" As for the logistics: ""There are possibilities. And sometimes it happens automatically while you sleep. It's natural.""

The firm is more important than any individual member, in their opinion, so Harry saying he’s outta there to do his own thing is an affront to the others who have always done what was in the interest of the firm over their own. 

A lot of this goes back to when Edward, Duke of Windsor, abdicated the throne to his brother so he could marry a divorcee and hang out with Nazis. His brother became king despite always being the second son and his daughter, now Queen Elizabeth, went from being just a niece of the king to next in line.

1681,NoStupidQuestions,How do worms stay on the hook?,You impale them on the hook
1682,NoStupidQuestions,"Are ridiculously expensive funerals one of those fucked up american things we don't realize is fucked up, or is it like that everywhere?",Definitely also very expensive in post Soviet countries. Funeral agents somehow get info from police/ambulance when someone is dead and arrive sometimes as soon as minutes after the emergency services left. They then use the relatives distracted state of mind to get them to agree to ridiculous prices for everything (not like there's an alternative tho). Absolutely disgusting vulture practice.
1683,NoStupidQuestions,"Why are women who like children seen as nice, while men who like children are often suspected as pedophiles?","This was a prejudice that entered immediately after my wife and I separated 10 years ago. I had a school age daughter and was familiar with all the parents of all her friends (mostly other little girls). As soon as my wife was gone, I was suddenly a suspicious pariah. There was no playing together at our house after school, no play dates at our house, and basically no interaction that would have involved me being left alone with any of these other girls. I hosted a roller skating birthday party at a local rink and some of the parents only committed to letting their kids attend once they knew my mom was a co-host. It was baffling to me, and devastating to my daughter. There was ultimately one parent who absolutely didn’t care, and she supported me throughout the whole ordeal. She trusted me with her daughter like she always had, although we never really talked about it. It still killed me. Not having a wife doesn’t just turn a man/father into a pedophile, or reveal that he always was a latent pedophile who was only held in check by his wife."
1684,NoStupidQuestions,What are the dimensions of an adult llama?,You're going to need his measurements. This question is like asking for the dimensions of an adult man so you can make a sweater that fits one.
1685,NoStupidQuestions,When I kiss my dog on the head does he know it's a sign of affection?,"If you pair it with rubbing and petting, then I’m sure the dog would know"
1686,NoStupidQuestions,I was on a date yesterday and this girl was talking about her ex bf about 90% of the time. I told her that I'm sick of it (once i drunk my beer) and left. Did I do the right thing?,">Wtf lol, how do i reply to that???

Don't. Time to become spooky."
1687,NoStupidQuestions,Why does the majority of Americans seem to hate the idea of social contribution?,"Because a large amount of people don't feel like we get good value from the taxes we already pay, so there's often a skepticism that raising taxes would actually result in something that is worth the extra taxes taken"
1688,NoStupidQuestions,Is it normal to feel extreme 2nd hand embarrassment for characters to the point where it's hard to watch TV?,"I physically can't watch the office because I get too embarrassed for the characters. And sometimes I'll ""leave to use the washroom"" during cringey parts of other shows."
1689,NoStupidQuestions,Has anyone else been on their phone for hours just switching between apps and trying to find something to do without actually doing anything? Is this the new normal?,It's the new aimlessly switching channels on the TV.
1690,NoStupidQuestions,Why is it that sometimes when I claim that I am not a robot the website takes my word for it and other times I need to identify six pages of bicycles?,"[Here's a fun video explaining this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfU5H5tsp8c) 

Short answer, clicking the check-box gives the page permission to analyze your previous behavior for distinguishing parameters. When your prior behaviors succeed at assuring the analysis that you are not a bot it simply lets you through, otherwise you have to identify fire hydrants."
1691,NoStupidQuestions,"I have a conservative friend who asked if I knew anyone I could set him up on a date with, as he told me he hasn't been having any luck in a while. Should I tell him that his personal views are a huge turn off for most women of our age/generation?","There are a ton of conservative women, but if you’ll permit a generalization, chicks don’t like downers. His problem isn’t his beliefs, it’s his making them his identity and also having a depressive spiral about perceived setbacks. He’s living in the politics equivalent of a World of Warcraft Doritos filled basement."
1692,NoStupidQuestions,Why is it considered rude to speak another language other than English in the U.S.?,"As a Korean speaker I would say it depends on what area you are in. Some places you get stared, some places you will get confronted, and some areas people will just mind their own business."
1693,NoStupidQuestions,Why do I have to do my taxes? Why can't the IRS just send me a bill since they know how much I owe?,Because the tax preparation industry is huge and makes billions of dollars off this system. Everyone of your financial institutions reports your finances to the IRS so yes they already know how much you owe. Ronald Reagan wanted to make file taxes and easy as getting a bill but couldn’t because companies like H & R Block are huge lobbyist.
1694,NoStupidQuestions,"Don’t water a grease fire, don’t mess with a garage spring. What are some MORE potentially life saving tips?",Don't put your legs between the airbag and you when in the passenger seat of a car. Keep your feet in the footwell. If you get in an accident and the airbags go off they can propel your knees into your face with enough force to damage your skull.
1695,NoStupidQuestions,Is the upvote button orange or red?,"It’s orangered. It was a common term years ago that you’d “receive an orangered” as in getting a comment reply. 

"
1696,NoStupidQuestions,Why is there an age minimum for president but no age maximum?,"Because the people that wrote the constitution  in 1787 didn't think to do that. It's hard to speculate as to why, but there was presumably less awareness and study of mental deterioration at the time."
1697,NoStupidQuestions,Why is the US being blamed for the Taliban taking over?,"Lots of good answers here, but as an American and veteran that served in Afghanistan, most of the ANA and ANP we’re not exactly thrilled to be in the military/law enforcement. They did it for a check to feed their families. Many were playing both sides. Ultimately, in Southern Afghanistan where I served, the best analogy I can give to other Americans is that it was like the Wild West in the early formation of the USA. There were no actual laws, just government officials that took bribes and made shit up as they went. DC could say they had federal control, but in reality, it was insanely chaotic. 

Unifying Afghanistan would be like telling Native American tribes here in the US that ‘hey, you’re all going to be one big tribe now and be happy about it’. Oh wait. That’s basically what we did in the 1800’s. And ended up killing most of them to do so. 

The best solution I can think of in my (very) limited knowledge of geopolitics is they should have broken up the country based on tribal/religious beliefs, based on what those people wanted. That could have been the mission over the past 20 years. Otherwise, we have what we have now which is a country with no sense of identity because outside of Kabul, there is very little sense of Afghanistan as a country. 

Furthermore, the Taliban never left afg. They just waiting for the US to leave. We swung a sledge hammer to kill a fly and ended up killing 10’s of thousands of innocents unnecessarily and never defeated the enemy we went there to fight. (Which is debatable anyway, because technically that was al queda, not the Taliban.) Meanwhile, the country is no better off now than before. Actually, it’s worse, because the Taliban took all our equipment we gave Afghani forces."
1698,NoStupidQuestions,If President Trump randomly pulled out a gun and started shooting people at one of his rallys....would the secret service take him out or would they defend him from anyone who tried to stop him?,They would stop him
1699,NoStupidQuestions,"If I donated blood, and then person who got my blood immediately went and murdered someone and left some of their blood at the crime scene, is there a chance DNA results show it was my blood?",If you do a bone marrow transplant I believe that they will permanently show up as having your DNA on blood tests.
1700,NoStupidQuestions,Why did it feel like everyone in my classes in college were really smart and then in the “real world” I feel like everyone I work with is relatively dumb?,People in class are by design talking mostly about things they've been informed on by a person with a relevant PhD. If you heard those same people go out in the world and talk about other topics I bet they'd sound much less intelligent.
1701,NoStupidQuestions,Why don't American shops just add tax to price tags so everyone knows what the actual price is?,"Sad memories, Im from Mexico and I remember going to USA with mi parents to do some shopping, and I wanted a gameboy game, it was $39.99 so my parents gave me two $20 bills, I asked for the game and to my surprise it was like $42 or something, I could not buy it and I feel sad as a kid that day"
1702,NoStupidQuestions,"When a man cuddles another person do they just not get a boner, or do both parties just accept that a boner is present and continue cuddling?","I mean, there's a middle ground here.  You can position yourself in such a way that you can have a boner without pressing it against the little spoon, yeah?

In general though, contact can lead to erections even without attraction.  If you're spooning with your Bros and they grind that dumptruck right up against your slim Jim, it's really more of a personal call whether you two want to acknowledge that."
1703,NoStupidQuestions,Why is everyone either super chill or just plain in denial about the clearly elevated risk of nuclear war?,"When it comes to assuming it wont happen it's like that post about the guy who defuses bombs for a living.

""Either I'm right or it's suddenly not my problem anymore""

Edit: Holy smokes I've never gotten this many updoots on anything, let alone an award. Who knew all I had to do was steal someone else's meme lmao."
1704,NoStupidQuestions,"Why is American niceness often considered ""fake"" but Canadian niceness is just considered nice by Europeans?","As a European: I think on average Canadians are more ""polite nice"" and Americans are more ""enthusiastic nice"". Both can be equally fake or real, but American expression is much more on the extravert side of the scale. Compared to most European types of body language and tone of voice, American expression comes across as kinda over the top. Canadian is a bit closer to most European styles.

(Can't speak for other continents).

Edit: I feel like this might need the disclaimer that obviously this is based on my individual experience with individual Americans and Canadians and as such should never be taken as scientific fact."

1708,NoStupidQuestions,"Considering that “LOL” stands for laugh out loud, as an English speaker I’ve always wondered in countries where English is not the native language do they utilize this same abbreviation even though they speak another language when texting?","In Dutch, lol coincidentally means fun. As a kid, I just thought that's what it meant on the internet."
1709,NoStupidQuestions,Why do people stack their pancakes and pour syrup on?,Aesthetics.
1710,NoStupidQuestions,Is it rude if I ask him to brush his teeth before kissing and sex?,I would want someone to tell me If I smelled bad
1711,NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else feel like they haven’t found a really comfy sleeping position since they were a kid?,"This year I upgraded the bed and mattress. It was not cheap but it’s genuinely incredible. 6 months later and each night when I lie down on it I still get a “holy shit this is so comfy” moment. I’m lucky enough that these days I have the finances available to afford this, but honestly if I’d known how good it was when I was younger I might’ve taken a loan or something."
1712,NoStupidQuestions,Are guys really supposed to last for 30 min of penetration during sex?,"I'm on antidepressants  so sometimes, It can take 30 minutes. Maybe she only fucks depressed dudes

1714,NoStupidQuestions,Do most skinny people over 30 have to think about what they eat literally all the time?,"37M, yes and no. I pay attention a lot more than I used to, but i don't count calories daily. I check my weight on a scale every week. If it's up, I eat cleaner, if it's down, I eat out more or continue what I'm doing."
1715,NoStupidQuestions,"Why does a game like GTA 5, which is rated 18+, still censor profanity in its in-game messaging system?","A game may contain abusive language targeted towards NPCs, but that doesn't account for the degree of abusive language that players are capable of hurling at eachother.

Censoring explicit language serves to discourage players from verbally harassing eachother."
1716,NoStupidQuestions,"Does anyone make the weirdest impressions, sounds and voices when they are home alone?","Yes, almost so much so that I have to suppress the weird noises when I’m around other people."
1717,NoStupidQuestions,Do children in Saudi Arabian shopping malls get lost a lot because their mothers wear niqabs and they end up following a different woman?,"No stats, but personal experience. Lived in various countries in the Middle East and actually asked a local friend this once. Her response was that kids learn to recognize their mom’s shoes, purses, or other visible accessories. "
1718,NoStupidQuestions,Who decided “pickles” were pickled cucumbers and everything else was to be referred to as “pickled ______”?,"They’re the most common pickled item in the US, but the term generally refers to the most common pickled item. A similar occurred with ketchup which used to refer to a mushroom sauce, but tomato ketchup has taken over in popularity and as such, “ketchup” is often defaulted to tomato ketchup. Some pickle brands still specify cucumbers, and some ketchup bands still specify tomato."
1719,NoStupidQuestions,I'm in NYC and I've always wanted to hug a cow. Where can I go where this is possible once this mess is over?,The Farm Sanctuary in Watkins Glen. Big beautiful rescued cows you can hug. Pigs and goats are also worth a hug there.
1720,NoStupidQuestions,Why doesn't the US Government hire all the unemployed people to fix our failing roads and bridges?,FDR did that to alleviate unemployment during the Great Depression. The result was the [Works Progress Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration#Criticism).
1721,NoStupidQuestions,"Since students sit in classrooms for up to 8 hours a day and tuition is very high, why are we still sitting in the shitty blue plastic chairs from like 60 years ago?","Generally the more sturdy a chair is, the more uncomfortable it is.

Schools have to buy a crap ton of chairs. They want them to last, be lightweight, and be easy to clean."
1722,NoStupidQuestions,Are there any movies that have no trees in it?,Cube.
1723,NoStupidQuestions,Why are mass shootings only perpetuated by males?,"I don't have an answer, but I wanted to add another question by pointing out that familicide is more often committed by men too: [https://theconversation.com/why-do-men-kill-their-families-heres-what-the-research-says-132314](https://theconversation.com/why-do-men-kill-their-families-heres-what-the-research-says-132314)"

1728,NoStupidQuestions,Why are black people living in America called African-Americans but white people are not called European-Americans ?,"The term ""African-American"" was [introduced by Rev. Jesse Jackson](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/31/us/african-american-favored-by-many-of-america-s-blacks.html) in the 1980s, who felt that the term ""blacks"" to describe this demographic was too racist and had picked up too many negative connotations.  He wanted a new term to help the black/African-American community to recapture their racial heritage.  The term has since become so ingrained in American discourse that we started to use the ""X - American"" construct for other ethnicities as well, but like Jesse Jackson it is usually because we feel an existing term has too many bad connotations.

Edit: Several people have pointed out that the term ""African-American"" has appeared in writing earlier, even [going back to the 19th century](https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/4216-the-origin-of-african-American), with one citation found [as early as 1782](https://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/04/21/the-term-african-american-appears-earlier-than-thought-reporters-notebook/) (hat tip to /u/lithographia).  However, it is still accurate to say that it only became a household term in America after Jesse Jackson began his efforts to introduce it into the public lexicon, and most people did not use the term in conversation before he popularized it."
1729,NoStupidQuestions,Do Americans really have people whose job is to just stand at the entrance of a store and greet people?,"When I was younger and worked for Hollister it was my job to stand by the door and say ""hey, what's up?"". So embarrassing."
1730,NoStupidQuestions,Has anyone else ever heard of leaving an “example lobster” when cooking lobsters?,"When you mentioned example lobsters I imagined it was an extra lobster you make to tell if it’s done or something. The example you use to see if the rest is cooked. 

But no everything you described is batshit insane. Why go through all that effort. Why not just make another lobster"
1731,NoStupidQuestions,How do I tell my wife she needs to lose weight?,"Lead by example. Maybe tell her you want to be in better shape so you can be healthier, and ask her to join you so you can do it together as a team. You would have to be committed and you can keep her motivated. 

It may come off less of a blow to her.   

on a more personal level..i dont know where you guys are in life...but if you have kids you want to be healthy for them or if you want kids, she shouldnt get pregnant right now..it wouldn't be good for her or baby. ....just a thought."

Their excuse is ""everyone already has a charger so it's environmentally better to stop including one that'll just get thrown away"". 

The real reason is they want to sell you a charger separately."
1735,NoStupidQuestions,Does North Korea just assume that we don’t know about the “dark” side of their country?,You know it's worse than you're being shown but you don't know how much worse.
1736,NoStupidQuestions,How do I discreetly dispose of a pool noodle in a public area?,"I guarantee no one cares, worst case scenario someone asks ""why do you have a pool noodle?"" And you respond ""I dunno"" and throw it in the trash"
1737,NoStupidQuestions,"Delivered $12 food order to a person with Down Syndrome and they paid $100, what should I have done in this situation?","I have an adult brother with Down Syndrome who lives independently in an apartment with staff who assist him. Intellectual disability ranges vastly in adults with Downs and it's impossible to know whether or not he knew the value of the money he handed you. I would 100% double check to make sure that he realized how much he handed you. Individuals with Downs are often very kind and it's possible he knew it would make you happy but didn't realize the repurcussions of his kindness. i.e. Not having grocery money or money for that cool day trip he has planned for the week with his family or care providers. My brother has done similar things like this before without fully understanding what he is doing (he typically struggles with math as well) despite him being considered very high functioning.

TLDR; Double check with the individual, it's impossible to know if he realized what he was doing. If he did; awesome for you. If not; you may have ensured that he has food this week.

EDIT: Wow! Thanks for the kind words, awards and upvotes! I'm pretty new to reddit, so you guys made my day!"
1738,NoStupidQuestions,"Why are people so against sex work, yet watch and pay for porn, etc.?","A lot of people look down on janitors and trash collectors too, but still want clean buildings and neighborhoods. And the internet is full of people who demean retail workers but still want their service (and a discount!). 

I guess they consider certain jobs to be lower class and less deserving of respect."
1739,NoStupidQuestions,Why do poorer people usually have the highest number of children?,"Can't speak for other countries but here in Bangladesh poorer families (in rural areas) opt for more children intentionally. Their logic is that if they have more children, their family has more members who can engage in income-generating activities. Like, parents encouraging kids to drop out of primary school to go work for brick kilns, rural stores etc is fairly common.
Sadly, child labour runs rampant among lower-income groups and the relevant laws about this are hardly enforced."
1740,NoStupidQuestions,Why is having sex so important?,"The gynecologist probably needed to know if sexually transmitted diseases were a potential factor. The mental health professionals might have been concerned about some deep seated issues or repressed feelings. Also some hormonal imbalances and medical conditions can cause a lack of sex drive, which might have been their concern. Just be assured that although out of the ""expected"" or norm, you aren't ""wrong"" or ""defective"", just different."

1742,NoStupidQuestions,Why is sleep deprivation normalized in college/university?,It’s falsely equated to hard work so it becomes a symbol of pride. Also a ton of stress and procrastination.
1743,NoStupidQuestions,what jobs pay surprisingly high that no one knows about?,Medical waste disposal.
1744,NoStupidQuestions,Why are Americans complaining of Russian interference when they have been interfering the the politics and electios of other countries for decades?,"To be fair, those of us that are aware of it also complain about it. Generally speaking, I'm opposed to all foreign election interference."
1745,NoStupidQuestions,"Why do news anchors on some US news programmes share their personal opinions ? Where I live, anchors only job is to read the news in a calm, non emotional and impersonal manner. In the US, however, it feels like the anchors are in the studio to chit chat on personal level about what happened?","It’s really the rise of 24-hour news channels. That’s so much time to fill. So many hours of content to produce and frankly not that much stuff of global importance happens.

“War in some nation escalates” takes about 1 minute to report in a straightforward factual manner. So that leaves another 59 minutes of fluff and opinion to fill up the hour.

It’s also really cheap content to produce. Put a blow hard in front of a camera and let them speak. The more inflammatory the better because that keeps the audience. Its far cheaper to produce this kind of stuff, someone sharing their *opinion*, than it is to produce real investigative journalism that takes weeks or months to research. It’s a pretty toxic cycle."
1746,NoStupidQuestions,"Is ""guys"" gender neutral?","I have the exact same issue, working in a pub haha. I generally use ""guys"", even if it's just girls- I don't like saying ""ladies"" as I think it sounds weird. My nan, on the other hand, says she finds it annoying when she's in any group that gets referred to as ""guys"" though, so I think the appropriateness depends on how the person you're talking to perceives it."
1747,NoStupidQuestions,Did anyone else as a kid think quicksand was going to be a common danger in life?,"Not only did I think it was a common danger, I thought if you got stuck in it you were done for."
1748,NoStupidQuestions,How do people disown their kids?,"I think it has to do with shaming the family or hurting the family's ""honor"". I remember teenage girls getting pregnant and they would be sent off to live with grandma or something.  Some cultures have honor killings, where the family will kill the offending family member to restore their ""honor"".  I suppose every culture has families like that, that will ostracize a member or worse for bringing ""shame"" to the family."
1749,NoStupidQuestions,Do adults get bullied outside of high school?,"They're, usually, slightly more savvy about it. But yep, people don't stop being insecure jerks the moment they turn 18."

EDIT: I did want to address a common concern buried in the sea of ""yes"" and ""no"" comments below and that is the ""its not a joke, its true"" responses. I have addressed each so far but do need to sleep at some point and may miss some so here is my most recent response (I've typed out each one but they have the same theme):

""No, ""yes"" alone is a subversion of expectation designed to elicit a humorous response. ""Both"" is an answer, ""yes because..."" is an answer, but ""yes"" by itself is neither helpful nor useful, its core purpose is to be a joke.

It is true, but that has nothing to do with whether or not it was made in jest.""

EDIT2: That's actually a remarkably common theme of confusion with regards to our rules, none of them have anything to do with truth. Truth does not make things serious, it does not make things nice, it does not make things less illegal, or less of an agenda."
1751,NoStupidQuestions,Why do Americans call all black people African-American?,The term was [popularized by Black civil rights leader Jesse Jackson](https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/4216-the-origin-of-african-american) in the mid 80's when he ran for president.  It was considered the accepted term for Black people through the nineties and then dipped in popularity.

1753,NoStupidQuestions,"Why, after so many fucking years, do printers still work like overpriced pieces of shit?","They have lots of complicated moving parts that can jam and break and go wrong. Meanwhile the business model is to sell the printer as cheap as possible (maybe even at a loss) and make up the money on ink cartridge sales, so there's incentive to cut every corner on build quality if it makes it possible to sell the end result even cheaper.

If you want a reliable printer, look for one that _just does one thing_ (all the multifunction printer/scanner/copier/fax/shredder/espresso stuff just adds more complications and things that can go wrong) and be prepared to spend extra for quality. 

Or buy a laser printer - toner cartridges last way longer than ink cartridges, which flips the business model away from selling refills. Colour lasers are pricey, but a black and white laser printer can be reasonably inexpensive and is a better bet for reliability than an equivalent inkjet."
1754,NoStupidQuestions,"Am I the only one who divides ""eras"" of my life based not only on the events but also on the group of songs I listened to during that period of time?","Yes, I do this. It's been made easier by Spotify making a playlist of my 100 most listened songs every year. Certain songs elicit the memories of certain holidays or events as well.

I'm in a dearth of new music right now though. Sometimes I go through periods of finding lots of new music that I love, and then sometimes I go months without finding anything."
1755,NoStupidQuestions,Did Julian Assange LITERALLY spend every single day for the last 7 years inside the Ecuadorian Embassy?,"He spent every day within the embassy except for a few appearances on a balcony.

1757,NoStupidQuestions,"Net neutrality was repealed 2 years ago. Despite top posts on Reddit about having to pay to visit certain websites, personally I have not noticed a difference. What have been the real-world effects of the ruling on net neutrality?","AT&T exempting HBO Max from data caps is an example.

https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/06/att-exempts-hbo-max-from-data-caps-but-still-limits-your-netflix-use/

“When Democrat Tom Wheeler chaired the Federal Communications Commission, the agency ruled that AT&T and Verizon Wireless violated net neutrality rules by letting their own video services stream without counting against customers' mobile data caps while charging other video providers for the same data cap exemptions. In that case, AT&T was letting DirecTV services stream without counting against the cap. The FCC rescinded the finding less than two weeks after President Trump promoted Republican Ajit Pai to the chairmanship, and carriers have since been free to deploy data-cap exemptions as they wish.”"

1759,NoStupidQuestions,Why are beliefs in Norse gods (asatro) and Greek gods considered mythology and not religion?,"From a library and information science perspective , religion as a category typically deals with texts that are more of procedural, critical, or explanatory in nature. It's the more explicit instructions, commentary, customs/traditions/rituals, and foundational texts that create the actual practice of a religion. Mythology is made up of cultural stories and can be stories related to a religion but it's going to be written in narrative format which is distinct from informative and critical texts.  There absolutely is Christian and Jewish and Islamic and Hindu and Buddhist and so on and so forth mythology, there are classifications for mythologies from all currently practiced religions as well as classifications for the separate religious texts in modern library systems and that's also true for religions that are no longer practiced.

I realize this isn't exactly an anthropology answer but the ways we organize knowledge in a culture both inform how we talk about those things and is informed by how people were already talking about them when those categories were created. I don't know the exact history of it but I do know that separating those two sides of the religion coin is a thing humans have been doing for a long time at least in modern nations impacted by US library standards bc the knowledge organization systems we currently use are very old. And so, since someone searching for mythology texts would have to go to a different section than when searching for religious texts talking about it as though they're distinct from each other becomes a kind of normal or common.

Edit: Wow I did not expect this to blow up so much, thanks everyone for all the great engagement and the awards! This is the first time it's felt kinda cool to be a librarian and that was a really nice thing to wake up to!"
1760,NoStupidQuestions,Is The Smell Of Cigarettes Nostalgic To Anyone Else?,I used to work at a cigar shop and there was a group of old women who would come in every Sunday to play Bridge and drink mimosas at a table we had there. They never smoked any cigars but insisted that we not stop for them. They said it brought back memories of holidays when the men would go into the other room and smoke cigars and pipes and talk while the women would play cards.

1762,NoStupidQuestions,How do Americans pay those massive hospital bills?,"Had a miscarriage when I was 20 and needed a d&c surgery since I never bled. 

It was 20k. 

As 20 year olds my partner and I didn’t have that type of money. We wrote a letter to the hospital explaining our situation and how before the surgery we called to ask what the price would be and they told us it would be 3k, and how we’re broke emotionally and financially. 

Got a letter back with a new statement for 3k, and when I called to make a payment plan they told me that if I paid it all that day they would discount 50%. So I paid 1.5k and that’s how we did it."

1765,NoStupidQuestions,Why is lucifer aways shown as an ugly demon even though the Bible says he is the prettiest angel?,Because people have always associated beauty with good and ugly with evil.
1766,NoStupidQuestions,"Are the sounds we make during sex (moans, gasps, etc) a natural instinct or something we've learned from sex scenes in movies and porn?","I think porn has definitely made people feel the need to exaggerate their natural sounds, but it's quite normal to make noises while doing something that's physically intense, even if it's not specifically sex. Lifting, throwing, climbing, punching, pushing, etc, it's not uncommon to vocalize.

So it seems most logical to me that it's a mix of both."

1771,NoStupidQuestions,Can someone explain how a business like “In n Out” can pay their employees above minimum wage and still have their menu price lower than the competitors?,"In-N-Out has a couple things going for it that places like McDonalds doesn't:

- Their menu is relatively simple, so no need for special machines or training for new items  
- They spend almost nothing on advertising (the only thing I can think of is the occasional billboard near their locations)  
- They're privately owned, so there are no franchisees pressuring stores to keep costs low - in other words, they can do what's best for the company as a whole rather than each specific store  
- They recognize that better-paid employees are more happy and productive, and it may well be cheaper in the long run (see Costco for another example)"
1772,NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else get weirded out saying their own name?,"Yeah I get this all this time, saying my own name is really cringey for me, I've never really known why its bothered me though its a common name, and I dont have an issue with others saying it.

1773,NoStupidQuestions,Why isn’t sign language/asl taught alongside a child’s regular education?,"Like any language (or skill even) if you don’t use it, you lose it and sign language is something the average person would have no cause to use in a given year."
1774,NoStupidQuestions,Anyone else feeling burnt out and losing motivation in all aspects of life due to working from home?,"I've been working from home for about ten years. Finding a dedicated space as my ""office"" that I refuse to enter when I'm not on the clock made a huge difference. If you can't do that because you don't have the space, un-packing and packing up your work each day and putting it into a bag or drawer (or even covering your workspace with a blanket) helps to make you feel like work is at work and home is at home.

Also, getting dressed in different clothes to ""go to work"" helped my brain make the switch as did ""commuting"" to work by taking a 20 - 30 minute walk through the neighborhood to start and end each day.

Finally, when you're at work, be at work. It's tempting to kind of mix work and home tasks throughout the day, but then you run into the issues you've already noted and others have mentioned about separating things. IMHO, lack of separation between work and home is a big problem and burns you out."

1776,NoStupidQuestions,"If weed isn't addictive, then why do so many people who smoke weed have their whole life revolve around weed?",Because weed is addictive to some people. It is not widely viewed as ‘physically addictive’ but it can be ‘mentally addictive’.
1777,NoStupidQuestions,"Why do people say weed isn't addictive, even when someone has an obvious dependency?","People are really talking about physiological dependence. I’ve seen people so psychologically addicted to weed that they are unable to handle any kind of stress or anxiety without being high. Not to mention the insomnia if you’re used to smoking everyday.
It’s a different kind of dependence, but still dependence.


Edit: I am in no way against weed…or any other drug for that matter. I’ve known very successful, functional pot smokers. I’ve also known very successful, functional junkies. You just have to know your own body chemistry and make smart decisions. If it’s medicine for you, just make sure you treat it like medicine."
1778,NoStupidQuestions,Why don't some billionaire politician spent 200 million dollars to just fix the Flint water crisis? Wouldn't it be extremely good PR compared to paying for ads and stuff?,"So at this point the Flint water is fine.

The underlying problem is much larger.  Many older cities have lead pipes from the water mains into people's houses.  The mains have almost completely been replaced most everywhere.  It's in people's front yards where it is the problem.

This isn't a Flint problem, this is an older city problem.   Estimates to dig up everyone's front yards nation-wide run from several billion, to several hundred billion dollars. 

It's not considered much of a high priority, because the lead is basically stable when the water is not corrosive to it.  Flint had fucked up and started sending water that was corrosive to the lead."

1781,NoStupidQuestions,Am I being unreasonable asking people to not post pictures of my kids on social media?,That's not unreasonable at all. That's your decision as a parent and anyone that argues might have their baby picture taking priviledges revoked. I don't blame you and it'll be how I handle my children if/when I have them. People need to respect your decisions. Don't back down no matter what they say.
1782,NoStupidQuestions,Do house flies have zero short term memory or are they just fearless in their pursuit for my barbecue sandwich?,Flies are more like robots than thinking creatures.

1783,NoStupidQuestions,Why do some men consider a woman’s vagina loose if she sleeps with multiple men but not if she sleeps with the same man multiple times?,"I always thought this was an incorrect combination of the way people would refer to someone that sleeps around as having “loose morals” thus the term “loose woman” came about and some dumbass made the association with the vagina.

1788,NoStupidQuestions,"When dealing with a racist at work, is it okay to act dumb?","Playing dumb is a good strategy for a few reasons, but you need to be willing to draw the line as well.

It's a non-confrontational way to try to bring attention to their behavior, and the hope is that the person saying it realizes they are being racist and stops.

But! If they are shameless or double down on the racism, you should be willing to speak up. ""Oh. Why would you think that's funny? It seems racist/sexist/mean/whatever."" ""Huh. That seems like a rude thing to say."" You can keep playing dumb, but don't ignore or condone their behavior."

1796,NoStupidQuestions,Why isn't an addiction to amassing huge amounts of money/wealth seen as a mental illness the way other addictions are?,"Clinical addiction usually implies some type of self-destructive and self-harming behavior. You drink so much, that you lose your job and alienate all of your friends. You gamble so much that you blow away your life savings. You do so many drugs that you a rotting away your teeth and causing other ill health effects.

If you save a lot of money, but don't actually suffer as a result, then it is not problematic. There are certainly some people like hoarders where collecting items becomes problematic. If someone is so cheap that they practically starve themselves instead of buying food, that is a problem. However, saving money and being perfectly fine in all other parts of life is not a problem."

1799,NoStupidQuestions,I have a friend who's going through a second divorce at the age of 24. How do I tell him to stop forcing marriage without being an asshole?,You're not an asshole for telling him that he's rushing things and that his fear of being alone drives him into further abandonments. He's got to figure out why he's acting like this and work on that.
1800,NoStupidQuestions,"Is my poop already poo-shape naturally, or is my butthole more like a dough shaper?","Endoscopy nurse here, your entire large bowel is basically a soft tube, so the turds, which start out as a liquid, gradually harden into that tube shape as the bowel absorbs the water. The bowel is wider than your asshole, so it is squeezed a bit thinner on the way out but still retains basically the same shape. If you want to know how much thicker the turd is before it comes out, just hold it in a bit longer! As your Bowel absorbs more of the bog fluids, the turd will harden more until your butthole can no longer compress it on the way out. The turd will maintain its original shape as your gaping rectum is painfully stretched open to accommodate the now dry, rock hard dump. :)

Edit: Hey, just want to clarify a few things after reading all your questions, comments and a few private messages:

1. Don't seek medical advice from strangers on the internet!

2. Don't try to hold it in to see how big it gets! Super cool that you've got a high pain tolerance,  but you can actually do serious damage to your bowel and ass.

3. Bowels respond to change. Changes to diet, exercise and stress can affect the smell, firmness and how often you go. If you still have the same habits you've always had but your guts aren't behaving like they used to, see a doctor. Like I said. Bowels respond to change. You need to find out what has changed and whether it will continue to change."

Due to a lack of actual direction in the Bible regarding masturbation, I concluded that while the act itself probably wasn't an issue - the lustful thoughts and objectification of women/men was the real issue.

Most kids don’t want to get caught doing wrong things, so they make up lies about it. If you fight back immediately then it will just be your word against the bully’s. The school can’t be blamed or held accountable for your actions because they supposedly didn’t know what was going on

So what I heard was don’t punch someone in the throat on first offense, that’s just plain stupid (Granted that your physical integrity is not at risk)

Is someone making fun of you? Did someone harass you? Tell your teacher or the principal.

Now this won’t work, **obviously** and it’s what she always told me, it will just make the bully hide their actions better or even harass you even further. All you need do is to have it on record that you didn’t start the shit. 

Now, if you punch them on the throat on the second offense, then my parents could and did blame the school the whole day for not dealing with the bully. They already have on record that you attempted to solve things the “right way”, so they can fuck off with the “zero tolerance” stuff.  From that point on you are just protecting your physical integrity."

1817,NoStupidQuestions,Why am I so handsome in the mirror but so ugly in a photo? What's my real me? How do people see me?,"Someone on ELI5 explained this recently.

Basically, it's all about lens focal length. Phone cameras and common digital cameras have low focal length lenses, so that it can capture a large area. But low focal length also distorts your face in an unpleasing manner.

Example: https://cdn3.dpmag.com/2017/11/004-Focal_Length_Comparison.jpg

So, the mirror is more accurate.

Edit: It appears that I'm slightly incorrect. The facial distortion is due to close distance rather than the lens focal length. The higher focal length lenses basically allow you to shoot from farther away, from where the perspective looks more natural."

1819,NoStupidQuestions,To American people; Is it disrespectful or rude to not stand up during the National Anthem if I'm a tourist?,"Your post made me laugh, because I have been in this exact situation, except I was an exchange student and not a tourist. We were at a basketball game at my campus, and when the National Anthem started playing I couldn't decide if I should stand up or not, and made a split second decision not to. 30 seconds and a few nasty looks later I realized I probably should have, but randomly standing up in the middle of it would have felt even more awkward, so I just sat through the whole thing. 

So if I ever happen to be in that situation again I'll just stand up, haha. But I try to view it as a learning experience, and comfort myself by thinking that nobody but me probably remembers it."
1820,NoStupidQuestions,Do amputees require less calories to stay alive?,"Registered dietitian here: an amputee’s body requires fewer calories.** In fact, when we are calculating a patient’s/client’s caloric needs, there are specific percentages we use to account for the missing limb.

Hand: -0.7%; 
Forearm + hand: -2.3%; 
Entire arm: -5.0%; 
Foot: -1.5%; 
Lower leg + foot: -5.9%; 
Entire leg: -16.0%


**EDIT: I apologize for not clarifying (I just got excited to post how we’ve actually calculated body part weight percentages!): at rest, the amputated body would require fewer calories. However, due to additional energy requirements for ambulation (depending on the type of amputation, use of a prosthesis, wheelchair, etc), we would still use the above percentages to get a base rate then multiply by a particular factor to account for additional energy needs. And obviously we would monitor and make adjustments accordingly. Thanks to u/osco12 for pointing this out."

We have this fleeting chance to participate in an illusion called: I love my girlfriend, I love my dog. How is that not better? 

Knowing the truth that nothing matters can actually save you in those moments. Once you get through that terrifying treshold of accepting that, then every place is the center of the universe. And every moment is the most important moment. And everything is the meaning of life."""
1824,NoStupidQuestions,I'm a nice guy. Now what?,"As a reformed “nice guy” I can only tell you what clicked for me, and hope is resonates.

I used to take this same approach as well, and told myself that I wanted to find a partner that was my best friend, so why not pursue friendship first and try to get it to turn into something more?

After a lot of self reflecting, I realized that this worldview was an excuse I was using to not put myself out there to avoid rejection. And that when I tried to make the shift from friendship to something more, most woman rightfully thought “he was only my friend to get with me.”

My advice: Be upfront with what you want. If you meet someone and you want to date them, ask to see if they feel the same way. If not and you still want to pursue a friendship, go for it! But don’t assume that by doing so that they will eventually fall for you. Be their friend because you like them as a friend, and not because you still view them as a viable romantic partner. 

And as others have said, pursue friendships with people you think are cool, regardless of gender. And know that what makes a good friend is not the same as what makes a good relationship, so aim to keep them separate in your mind."

1827,NoStupidQuestions,"Theoretically, how could I defend myself from a Canadian goose if it were to become aggressive and attack me?","Wrangler and owner of angry pet geese and other angry birds here.

People think geese are assholes, and they are.  But they are predictable assholes who understand certain body language.  Here's some advice:

**Don't:**

* Break eye contact:  Eye contact is super important to geese and if you look away, they take it as a sign of weakness and an invitation to attack and dominate you.  Wearing sunglasses also counts as being a wimp, to a goose.
* Run away:  Don't turn away or try to run away for the same reasons as above, the goose will take it as a sign you are afraid and attack.
* Be silent:  Geese talk to each other all the time to tell each other where they are and what's going on.  They are freaked out by silence.  Talking in a normal tone might reassure them that you aren't a threat
* Back down: If they come at you, don't back down!  Fight that asshole goose, or it will be emboldened to keep attacking you or others

**Do:**

* Spread your arms out:  You look bigger and it's a gesture of aggression (geese open their wings slightly before fighting) and if you advance on them like that they may back down
* Hiss:  This is aggressive and they might decide to back down
* If they come at you, grab them by the neck:  Geese totally hate being grabbed by the neck.  Don't grab and squeeze, just grab lightly and they'll get freaked out and run away
* Grab their beak: If you're coordinated enough you can grab them by the beak when they come into bite you too, they also hate this.  Bonus if you get them with their beak open, geese tongues are cool to touch
* Stand slightly to the side to avoid being punched by their wing... wrists?  They love to come in swinging with their wings after grabbing you, but if you stand slightly to the side while hanging on to their beak/neck, they can't catch you straight on with their wing punches

Also remember you're a person and it's just a goose.  The worst thing it can do is nip you with its beak or wing punch you, which doesn't even really hurt!

Once you start to notice the habits and body language of geese, you can actually end most conflicts peacefully without having to fight.  Even my most aggressive gander was a sweetheart if you just communicated with him in the right way.  Sometimes he was totally just trying to start shit to look dominant though, and then I  had to pin him down and sit on him until he calmed down, otherwise he'd just keep punching me with his wings.  What a lovable dick, I miss him.

Edit: Guys I didn't eat him, he was my beloved pet.  He sadly died of reasons unknown, although it was the winter and avian flu was sweeping through the farms in our area and causing a lot of bird deaths so I suspect that might have been why.

Edit 2:  There is also a lot of concern that I routinely squashed my gander with my ass which lead to his untimely death.  I'd like to clarify that as hilarious as the image of someone sitting their ass directly on top of a goose is, I just pinned his body down with my legs and used my arms to hold his beak to his neck until he stopped his shit.  It didn't hurt him, but he was a big boy and it took all four limbs to restrain him when he was belligerent.  

The dog also used this tactic when the gander got uppity with her and sometimes I'd come out to see the dog lying with the gander pinned under her forelegs with his outraged goose face poking out.  They were good buds most of the time though.

1828,NoStupidQuestions,"Does anyone have a ""hollow-ness"" and hatred toward advertisements?","Two things at play:

1. The ""nontarget market effect."" When we see an ad that was meant for another type of person, we feel really intense negative feelings like resentment, disgust, irritation, anger. This is a documented effect of mistargeted advertising and is why ""wasted coverage"" is such a bad thing.

2. Ads rarely try to have an effect on you immediately. The interruptive kind rarely strive for emotional impact, even. Awareness is usually the goal. By the time you've seen an ad with a clear brand or product 3 times, you'll remember that brand or product the next time you have the problem the ad addresses. That's usually an ad's point. When the goal is emotional or transactional, different marketing techniques are usually used."
1829,NoStupidQuestions,"When I was a kid laying in bed at night, I would often feel like my bed was spinning around, making it hard to sleep. As I got older, this went away. Did anyone else experience this and, if so, does anyone know what the phenomenon is called?","Yes!! I had this starting as a child, and it faded away sometime around my early 30’s.  It was sort of a combination of spinning/pulsing/rocking.  Was pretty much guaranteed to happen every night, but the intensity would vary unpredictably.  It was different from anything I’ve experienced due to other ear issues, and it only happened when I was lying down to go to sleep.  If it was an inner ear thing, it was remarkably persistent, specific to a very narrow set of circumstances, and very long-lived — 25 years or so without any real breaks.  I’ve always wondered what the hell it was all about."
1830,NoStupidQuestions,"US milliennials (roughly 22-37 yrs of age) are facing heavy debt and low pay which prevents or delays them from buying homes (or other large purchases) and starting families compared to their parents, are other countries experiencing the same or similar economic issues with this age group?","I think the problem is pretty much global. I'm from Zambia, the situation is the same. Our parents were able to buy/build houses from a salary they got from a job which didn't require a college degree. Back in the day those were common jobs; they called them job on training when you're getting started in the industry"

Why do the bots and AI I play against today feel exactly the same as the ones I was fighting in Half-Life and starcraft in 1998?,"Better AI doesn't always mean harder. You can very easily make an AI that's really good at the game, has 100% accuracy, and absolutely floors you, but that just isn't fun. In many cases devs tone down the enemies so that the player can feel good about themselves and the game can be fair.

The devs of The Last Of Us mentioned that in an early build, the enemy would sneak tactically behind you and kill you before you had a chance to react. This mechanic was dropped because it wasn't fun and felt unfair.

1834,NoStupidQuestions,"Why is it that when I wake up early for work I can instantly fall back asleep, but when I wake up early and don't have obligations it's much more difficult to do so?","I think it has something to do with the alertness of your brain. If it knows the alarm is coming, it's easy to stay shut off. If I wake early on a free day, I usually feel rested and like I've woken up naturally.

Or maybe it's coincidence and you don't really remember the times you went back to sleep easily on a free day right now, because they didn't feel as special and falling back asleep when you woke before your alarm does feel like extra sleep somehow."

1837,NoStupidQuestions,"Does anyone else feel the need to ""balance out"" what happens on one side of their body with the other?","The problem with balancing out the other side is that you still started on one side so it still doesn't feel equal. I do this a lot less now but as a child I would get frustrated with it. If for example I winked my left eye, I would then wink my right. Then I would start again by winking my right eye first and then my left. Then I would repeat the whole process by winking right left left right. Then left right right left right left left right. It would get into a cycle and I could only stop if something external distracted me from it."

1847,NoStupidQuestions,Is poop already poop-shaped before it comes out or is it just a mass of shit and becomes poop-shaped when it comes out?,"Your feces takes the shape of your intestines as it moves through your digestive system.

Edit: Okay, so this blew the fuck up and I'm still bewildered as to why, but let me answer some questions I keep getting multiples of.

* I have no idea how this pertains to animals with weird shaped poop. Each animal has a different digestive system with unique attributes.

* If you have diarrhea, your feces is moving through you too quickly and doesn't have the chance to form into the shape of your intestines.

* If you have hard pellets, your feces is staying in you too long, so the water in your feces is really low, which stops it from forming to one solid piece that looks like your intestines.

* No, it's not an exact replica of your intestines, but it is an approximation. Each person should have their own ""normal"" poop shape that closely resembles the size and shape of intestines. Always check your poop for bizarre abnormalities! It could literally save your life."

1877,NoStupidQuestions,How to report a 911 Operator?,"Retired 911 dispatcher here to say she is breaking numerous laws (federal, state, and employment) which she is 100% aware of as she has to sign an annual, legally binding document explicitly stating she will not do exactly this (most especially the looking up people.) She is going to get fired, and will most likely be prosecuted for more than one federal felony if the investigation uncovers that she’s done this *even once*. 

Thank you for not being ok with her behavior, thank you for asking for advice, and thank you for protecting the public from the threat that she most certainly is. Her employer needs to be notified, and it is 100% best that you **do not** provide *any* information to anyone in dispatch. Call their non-emergency number (you’ll get a dispatcher, do not tell them anything) and request to speak with the on-duty supervisor regarding filing a formal complaint against an employee of the department. At this point, it is illegal for the dispatcher to ask why/who/what for or to pressure you in any way. They may transfer you immediately, or need to call you back (depending on how large their department is/if they have a department or officer dedicated to handling complaints/or due to volume/type of incidents they’re handling at the time of your call), or they may ask you to come in in person. They’ll want your phone number, but you can request to remain anonymous and most agencies will not require more given the nature of your call. They will 100% want to know so even if you meet resistance at any point initially, be firm, confident, calm, and consistent in stating that you will only speak with the on-duty supervisor/watch commander.

**Make sure not to call while your friend is on duty.**

The department will be required to have an external agency investigate/do an audit, and that agency will notify all appropriate governing bodies about any violations. There are systems in place at every LE agency to deal with exactly this sort of situation, and they will be far better equipped to handle contacting whoever needs to be contacted than an individual citizen. 

If, for *any* reason, this department is so podunk that you’re concerned about it being covered up, or if you are refused a meeting (either by phone or in person) or are forced to provide the specific reason for your call by anyone other than the watch commander/supervisor, simply hang up, and contact a separate, parallel county or state agency. 

And again, thank you for taking this next step. What she’s doing is a gross violation (ethically and legally) and you are inarguably correct in reporting her. She needs to be stopped, like yesterday."

People's sleep schedules got really out of whack when there's no light cues to go to bed. So some people's days ended up being 20 hours. Some 30 or even 35. My dad said he and his boss only overlapped in person every couple of days because they got so out of synch.

The dining hall up there served breakfast and lunch/dinner food every 6 hours around the clock.  So no matter what weird sleep schedule you were in you would be able to get breakfast during your ""morning"" even if that was at like 9pm."
1893,NoStupidQuestions,Why do people buy sports video games when they are literally the exact same every year?,"A long time ago, in a console generation far, far away...

The games used to change drastically every year.  Back when other mainstays took years between releases, Madden was considered a *must buy* every year - graphic updates (new tackle animations, customizable helmets), mechanical innovations (cone of vision, playmaker to direct receivers), feature enhancements (import draft class, injured reserve), etc.  There used to be good reason to buy annually.  

Once EA realized the game had caught up to reality (mechanically, not in terms of physics) they started taking things away only to bring them back years later, simply for the hype. Continued update to physics would have been ideal but it’s a lot more difficult to sell “new pass blocking AI” to a 12 year old new to gaming than it is “new superstar mode”.  

Monopolize the space with the NFL license and EA is not going to waste programmer salary on “footwork physics” when they can just put something flashy on a re-skinned box and sell millions to idiots.  

Source - begrudged, annual, 20-year repurchaser, who only stopped a few years ago, who regrets the last five purchases, but remains painfully optimistic the future holds improvement.  

Ideally the NFL sells the rights to....   ugh was about to say 2k thinking of the one with Eagles TO on the cover but even they’ve gone to shit.

TLDR: there used to be a good reason.  There isn’t one anymore.  But Game companies aren’t going to give up on revenue and will always pull BS to lure us into buying again and again.  The only way they’re gonna stop is if we stop buying, and we ain’t so they ain’t so yeah"
1894,NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else get unreasonably anxious when they here a car door shut outside the house?,"My anxiety with this stems from when I was a kid enjoying my time at home alone, then hearing a car door close outside and knowing one of my parents just came home and my peaceful solitude is now ruined. I dont live at home anymore but I still get that way no matter what. 

Maybe something similar with you?"
1895,NoStupidQuestions,How do I stay politically informed without getting miserably depressed and hopeless?,"Remember that you don't have to deal with all the world's problems. Educate yourself, but don't take all the awful things you hear onto your shoulders. Focus on your world and the things you do every day, and if you try your best to make a positive difference to the people around you and make decisions that are in line with your morals and values, then that's enough. Use the information you learn to better yourself and develop your inner compass. Go with the flow and focus on creating positivity no matter what ends up happening. That's all you can do

EDIT: To be clear, I'm not saying ""do nothing"". I am saying, don't let the world depress you. Don't think that nothing will ever change. If you make a decision to better yourself, help someone else, help the environment, then you made a big change in your corner of the world! I read a good comment that summed it up: ""I can't save the world but I can save my piece of it."" And voting is incredibly important and please do that if you can!"
1896,NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else stay up at night thinking about how crazy it is that we actually exist?,"I love seeing this stuff online, and think these kind of questions and comments are  very intelligent and deeply meaningful thoughts to ponder...some of the same stuff I've pondered most of my 68 years of life. This kind of thinking Informs and enriches our lives, and I'm glad we have the internet now to spread this around! Ontology and Zen...Bring it on!"
1897,NoStupidQuestions,Does anybody else ever say “It WOULD be 8:00 o’clock right now” for about the next month during Day Light Savings?, As I kid I’d say “it’s really 7 right now” and my parents would get pissed
1898,NoStupidQuestions,"If so many women want jeans that have pockets, why doesn’t a big company capitalize on that market and mass-producing them?","I feel like all the answers you got so far are about ""why don't women's jeans *usually* have big pockets"" instead of answering your actual question of why it seems that every woman on the internet agrees that jeans *should* have bigger pockets but no one capitalizes on that. 

When you google ""womens jeans with deep pockets"", you actually do find a few brands that try this. [Radian Jeans](https://radianjeans.com/pages/about-us) is the first that popped up in my search. 

As for ""oh well why isn't everyone just buying those then"", I'd speculate that lots of women struggle to find jeans that really suit them anyway, even without taking pocket size into account. Therefore ordering jeans online from a brand you've never heard of simply because they have pockets might be too big of a risk to just end up with ill-fitting jeans. That was my thought at least, though admittedly I *am* intrigued to try it."
1899,NoStupidQuestions,Why is Bluetooth still so terrible? Why do we still use it?,"A) the connection is only as good as the weakest link. It doesn't matter how good your headphones are if the device you are connecting them to is crap.

B) Bluetooth uses significantly less power than wi-fi, so its connection is worse. If it used as much power as wi-fi, you wouldn't have small bluetooth devices.

C) Bluetooth antennas tend to be worse than wi-fi ones, again because size.

D) With all this in mind, have you ever tried to connect to the one wi-fi network that is just barely within reach? If yes, you probably experienced similar problems."
1900,NoStupidQuestions,"It's 2020 and we still can't have 2 bluetooth headphones connected to the same device, why hasn't this ever been solved?",You need Bluetooth 5.0 and OEM support to do this.
1901,NoStupidQuestions,"I have really bad anxiety, could someone run through how to order from Starbucks?","1. If it's iced say iced.  If not skip this step.
2. If it's Decaf say Decaf.  If not skip this step.
3. Number of shots.
4. Cup size- short (8oz), tall (12oz), grande (16oz), venti (20 oz unless you get it iced then its 24 oz), trenta (30oz, only for teas)
5. Syrup (some drinks you can add a syrup, some you might want to make sugar free)
6. Type of milk (2%, nonfat, soy, etc)
7. Customizations (optional: no foam, extra foam, temperature, number of pumps, etc.)
8. Type of drink (latte, cappuccino, mocha, tea, frappucino)

Edit: Do your best but don't worry about getting the order right.  When I was a barista I never judged people for not knowing the correct order to say things.  Say it in whatever order you want, ask questions, they are trained to put it in the right order.  You can also write it down first if that would help.

Edit: people are saying I made it more complicated.  You don't need to include every category unless you want to.  It can be as complicated or simple as you want.  If you want a 16oz vanilla latte and you dont care what kind of milk you get or how many pumps, you'd just say Grande Vanilla Latte.  Or Medium Vanilla Latte.  Or 16oz Vanilla Latte.  And your Barista will silently bless your order. Most of the categories are for specificity. 

Honestly, I don't think Starbucks set out to make ordering a drink this complicated.  I think it was them simply adapting to customer demand and the need to be able to deal with these customizations at a fast pace.  And believe me, Starbucks gets a lot of picky customers as I'm sure most coffee shops do.  So if you go in ordering an iced decaf 3 shot Venti 2 pump Sugar free Vanilla, 6 pump regular vanilla, 1/2 non-fat, half soy because your gluten free, two splenda Carmel Macchiato with shots on the top you only have yourself to blame for Starbucks' complex ordering system.  And if you can't say this in some semblance of the order in which I detailed above you only have yourself to blame when they get it wrong."
1902,NoStupidQuestions,When people are in comas do the nurses brush their teeth?,"We actually do more than just brushing! We regularly check the gums and tongue for signs of any infection. Patients in a coma obviously are unable to swallow and clear secretions normally so there is high risk of secretion build up, two things can happen from this. Bacteria can build up, track down the endotrachial tube used for ventilation and cause a hospital acquired pneumonia. Also yeast colonies can form and develop into oral thrush. Both of these are common complications and so most units (certainly where I work in the UK) have what's called a VAP bundle (VAP stands for ventilator acquired pneumonia) and includes sitting patients upright where possible, regular suctuoning of the mouth and throat, regular mouthcare with special hydrating gels, and, of course, regular teeth burnishing. Assuming the patient has teeth. Although if they don't we still do all the other steps!

Edit: Thanks for all the lovely compliments. Whilst I have a small bit of attention from a large group of people around the world I would just like to say this; if anyone you are with or know is a healthcare worker then please take extra special care of them during this pandemic. It will be a huge physical and mental toll on everybody and they are right there on the front line. We're just like house plants, all we need is to be fed and watered and occasionally have someone talk to us. Love each other."
1903,NoStupidQuestions,"Is there a website that lets me search for a product on Amazon, then suggests a different site to buy it from?","If you go to the product page for a given product on Amazon, you can usually find the manufacturer/seller and their respective website on the right and buy directly from them."
1904,NoStupidQuestions,"If they put the cereal in a plastic bag anyways, why don't they just sell cereal packaged like potato chips?",Store brands have been sold like this (packaged like potato chips) at least since I was a kid in the 80s. Brand name cereals have likely calculated that the cardboard boxes make them appear superior and sell more cereal.
1905,NoStupidQuestions,Do people actually “accidentally” cheat when they’re drunk or do they just use that as justification?,"on a related and lighter note:

remember the black out drunk dude that was getting tucked in by his girlfriend? he didn't recognize his girlfriend in his blacked out stupor but still remembered that he had a girlfriend; he was shoving his girl's hands off him and kept yelling ""no! i have a girlfriend and i love her!"""
1906,NoStupidQuestions,"How do people who work a 9-5 job go to the mechanic, get weekly therapy, go to the bank, or otherwise use businesses that are also only open 9-5?","I get an hour for lunch, so for most things, I just have to pick what I do that day.

As for the mechanic, drop off the car before work. Either get a loaner or a co-worker/spouse to drive you to work or take you home."
1907,NoStupidQuestions,Teenager camps my apartment entrance to beat me up? What do i do?,Size means nothing if he uses a weapon. Call the police ASAP.
1908,NoStupidQuestions,Would it be weird to pay $300 for a stuffed animal clone of my dog that died yesterday?,"Grief sucks. Loss sucks. I’m sorry for your loss. 

Maybe wait a couple weeks and then decide."
1909,NoStupidQuestions,Why do employers require a doctors note?,"I worked in a place like that once, didn’t make any sense to me and it cost so much to go to the doctor as well. I argued that it’s better if I just take a full day of rest, and come back fine the next day.

Long story short, they made me go. The doctor told me to stay home for over a month. Couldn’t stop laughing after I told my boss.

EDIT: To those asking, I had over 200 hours of maxed out unused PTO so I was paid. I used the time to recuperate, realize I was overworked, and look for a new job. Came back well rested for a couple of months, then left for a better job!"
1910,NoStupidQuestions,Does everyone else day dream and use their imagination constantly throughout the day?,"I daydream a lot, definitely multiple times throughout the day, but not constantly because I get preoccupied with whatever I’m doing in the moment: movies, books, etc etc. But I’ll start daydreaming or imagining stuff if I’m doing something mindless, from driving to showering to (sometimes) work."
1911,NoStupidQuestions,"In the ""I told my child I ate their Halloween candy"" prank, people praise the kids who ""forgive"" their parents. Why?","I only liked the kid that told his mom ""if you were hungry you should have eaten what is on the fridge"" because that is the most logical thing to say and is the kids ""are you dumb or just fucking stupid"" equivalent"
1912,NoStupidQuestions,How did pspspspsps become the thing we say to cats?,The sound is quite high pitched so it gets a cats attention when they're not looking at you.
1913,NoStupidQuestions,"If I listen to an audio book, can I tell people I read the book?","My husband and our neighbour (we're in a book club together) have discussed this at length. My husband only listens to the audiobooks, and our neighbour is adamant that that does not entitle him to say he has ""read"" the book. They refer to it now as my husband ""consuming"" the book. They both think it's hilarious and make a point of it at least once a meeting and several times in between, when we're just visiting each other. We're up to chapter 7, I'm not sure how much longer I can take it.

Edit to add: A lot of you have missed the point that THEY BOTH THINK IT'S HILARIOUS. It's a joke, people."
1914,NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else sometimes have a reaction out loud when thinking about something embarrassing?,Yes lol.  Sometimes I say something out loud just to try to distract myself from the overwhelming sudden embarrassment too.
1915,NoStupidQuestions,"Does spotify make their ads especially corny, repetitive and annoying so that people will one day meltdown and go premium?","There is a restaurant I refuse to ever go back to because of their use of Spotify WITH ADS! 
Okay nice glass of wine, some veal pasta, Italian music.... SPOTIFY PREMIUM TRY FREE! Interrupting a nice meal over and over 
"
1916,NoStupidQuestions,Why do people with detrimental diseases (like Huntington) decide to have children knowing they have a 50% chance of passing the disease down to their kid?,"Huntington's Disease runs in my family. My grandmother had it. Of her four sons it killed three of them. 

Only her oldest son, my father, had children and we were born before the test was available and before she began having symptoms and chorea. 

I have been tested and don't have it. My brother isn't so lucky..."
1917,NoStupidQuestions,Don’t transgenders just reinforce the gender norms?,Most trans people have something called gender dysphoria. It’s basically the extreme discomfort that arises due to having physical characteristics that don’t align with our actual gender/ being perceived and treated as a different gender than our own. It sucks. This is why we usually medically and/or socially transition in some way. Sometimes gender norms like hair and clothing can help us alleviate gender dysphoria and feel better in our own bodies. We can still break gender norms though and many of us do. We just have to be careful to not cause gender dysphoria in ourselves or inspire backlash by others for doing so. Hope this helped!
1918,NoStupidQuestions,"Did anyone else think the ""D"" in Disney was a ""G""?","Yes, that happens especially for kids, they commonly read it as ""Gisnep""."
1919,NoStupidQuestions,Why don't femcels and incels date one another?,"I don't know any personally, but I would assume they've given up on dating and won't put in the effort to get to know an incel or femcel, depending on their preference.  I also don't think incels or femcels would make great partners in general, which could explain why they won't date each other."
1920,NoStupidQuestions,Why do I feel lonely when I’m by myself and crave human interaction but when I get human interaction I hate it and want to be by myself?,"Because at your core you want safe/genuine connection with others.

But you've also learned to that being around others can be emotionally dangerous and you feel compelled to protect/hide/fear expressing this genuine version of yourself in the moments you're around others. (or maybe it's not safe being genuine around the people in your life...or a mix of both)

You want safe/genuine connection but what you're getting is unsafe (at least in your eyes), non genuine interactions. 

Unsafe interactions are worse than being alone a lot of the time"
1921,NoStupidQuestions,Why would anyone living in EU with 4 weeks of vacation and paid sickdays ever move to work in the US?,"The people who do emigrate from the EU to the US tends to do so for the high-money jobs, not the menial ones.  And of those, a lot are ""spend a few years in the US for the cash and get out when its time to start a family"" type jobs."
1922,NoStupidQuestions,Do men just make brownies sometimes?,I sometimes just bake a cake and eat it all by myself.
1923,NoStupidQuestions,Did paper airplanes get invented before or after real planes?,"Before, but they called them paper darts. "

1925,NoStupidQuestions,What do I say to homeless people?,I've been homeless and a polite rejection is plenty. Just be nice.
1926,NoStupidQuestions,How famous were the twin towers before 911?,"Pretty well known.     They were mentioned or referenced in tv shows set in New York fairly often.   

They were a tourist destination for many people visiting New York, since you could go up the top floors or near the top to see the view and there were restaurants and stuff up on the upper floors."
1927,NoStupidQuestions,Does it piss anyone else off to see crabs and lobsters boiled alive?,It's illegal in Australia. Crustaceans have to be killed or sedated before boiling.
1928,NoStupidQuestions,"Meth isn’t a “cool” drug, so why do people try it?",I started doing meth because I was already doing heroin. I started doing heroin because I got addicted to pain pills and heroin was cheaper. I'll have five years clean in October.
1929,NoStupidQuestions,What the fuck does it mean when a sign says “speed enforced by aircraft”?,"The aircraft watches you pass two sets of lines and if you pass too quickly, they radio an officer in a car."
1930,NoStupidQuestions,Does it seem to anyone else like every single thing in reddit lately is being posted to 3 or more subs and reaching the front page multiple times? Why is this happening so much lately?,Literally every top post on /r/notmyjob is crossposted at /r/crappydesign every time.
1931,NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else replay conversations they've had throughout the day and feel like they made a fool of themselves?,"Yes, in the moment of a social situation I am totally fine, but once I have stepped away from it I start to microanalyze every part of it until I feel like I was awkward and did everything wrong and that person definitely thought I was an insufferable idiot. 

In people I have confided this to, I have been told I do not come across that way at all. Social anxiety is a real fun one.

I will probably stress over this reddit comment later."
1932,NoStupidQuestions,Why weren’t guillotines used for amputations?,"Absolutely not my area of expertise, but my understanding is that you don't want to cut all the way through.  You want to leave a flap of skin to close up the nub.

Also, the main difficulty in an amputation is getting through the bone.  If you've ever tried to use a cleaver in the kitchen, you know that it takes a fair amount of force to get through even a thin bone.  I imagine trying to use a guillotine on a limb would either result in an incomplete cut, with the blade stuck in the bone, or a massively splintered bone."
1933,NoStupidQuestions,Why do people care so much about Biden's age but not Trump's?,"Old guy, here, I care about both of their ages. They are both too old, imo. It is time for the younger generations to take hold of the reins. This is their time, now. Edit: There sure are a lot of stupid answers to this not so stupid question in these comments. Buncha savages in this thread."

1935,NoStupidQuestions,Did anybody else just... not 'come out' about their sexuality?,"I never came out. 
I started to date my girlfriend, and my family found out or I told them that I was dating her.
I never once said anything about my sexuality when saying I was in a relationship with her.
The only time someone asked was my sister asking if I was fully gay. That’s the only time.
My dads side does not know I am dating her yet but when I do tell them I am not making it about sexuality at all, just going to tell them that I am in a relationship with her.
I don’t want to make a big deal out of it at all. So to answer your question: yes. i never came out, and i’m glad."
1936,NoStupidQuestions,Is it weird to go to the hospital just for the cafeteria?,I used to work close to the hospital in town and the food was pretty good and super cheap so a lot of the time if I didn't pack a lunch I'd just slide over there. Nobody is going to ask you weird questions about why you're there and I've actually hung out in the cafeteria when I did pack my lunch before just for some privacy and to use the free WiFi which a couple of other people seemed to do as well so as long as you're chill it's fine. I accidentally know where just about everything on the first floor of that place is now though because it's like a maze and I took a wrong turn and didn't know if I was going to find my way out one day. Started using fire exit maps to figure out where in the daylight I ended up at.
1937,NoStupidQuestions,"Why are we surprised there's so many conspiracy theorists when we have hundreds of years of illicit, covert government operations that have been actually documented?",It's not so much conspiracy theories as unreasonable conspiracy theories. There's a big difference between the US secretly trying to destabilize some foreign nation they don't like and them working together with all the nations including the ones they don't like to convince people that someone walked on the moon. Or convince them that the world is round.
1938,NoStupidQuestions,Is it okay to thank the man who unknowingly saved me?,"Do it. He may not know how just by being a human being he unknowingly saved a life. I think if something good happens you should always be thankful in some way. I think you'll be fine. 

Think if it this way. Is okay just to say thank you in return?  Of course it is!"
1939,NoStupidQuestions,"Are the two ""c""s in thicc supposed to represent large ass cheeks?",They dont... But they should and do now.
1940,NoStupidQuestions,"Why is it so hard for native English speakers to differentiate between ""then"" and ""than"" when it is their own language?",Because you learn your native language through listening and speech. You don’t see things written down until later.
1941,NoStupidQuestions,"How many times do I have to press ""show me less of this"" on those live broadcasts until I don't see them anymore?","Reddit is trying to push live broadcasts. They're not going to stop doing that. ""Show me less"" is just going to show you less of that type of broadcast, not fewer broadcasts overall."
1942,NoStupidQuestions,Please help a clueless dad and his daughter. Are there particular TikToks we should follow to find out and learn the popular dances?,Love that you are doing this! If you put “tiktok dances 2020” in to YouTube it will pull up the most current popular options. Many with the dance’s names and step by step instructions. I hope you all have fun!
1943,NoStupidQuestions,Why and how did we all collectively agree we didnt care about our ringtones and that we weren't going to change them anymore?,That was back when there was very little to do on phones.
1944,NoStupidQuestions,"If someone is imprisoned for a crime, then escapes prison but is later found to be innocent, will they be punished for escaping prison?","The laws will depend on your country. Here in Sweden it is not a crime in itself to escape prison. Of course if you hurt people or break property, that is still criminal, but it wont get treated any especial just because it was a part of escaping prison."
1945,NoStupidQuestions,Why haven't people lost faith in god?,"If you want a serious answer, the book 'Mere Christianity' by C.S. Lewis is a fascinating read. Lewis was, somewhat famously, a hardcore atheist who came to believe in God later in life. There are some things in the book I don't buy. His theory about homosexuality and sexual perversion are too much of a stretch and outdated. I also remember a bit about why men are the final decision-makers in a marriage that was ridiculous.  Regardless, the book is largely an attempt  to logically breakdown and answer your question and I recommend it."
1946,NoStupidQuestions,Is it possible for a soccer player to mold his hair in a way so he can hold the ball and have it balance on his head and just run into the goal?,"There's a rule against trapping the ball in any way in order to ""carry"" it (e.g between your thighs, under your shirt etc) and I'm pretty sure this would qualify."
1947,NoStupidQuestions,Are black people in Canada called African Canadians?,"Lived in Canada my whole life and have never heard the term African Canadian, we typically just say Black."
1948,NoStupidQuestions,Why is Amazon still so popular if everyone knows that they treat their employees badly?,Convenience
1949,NoStupidQuestions,"If I were to dip my ballsack in ink and press it against a piece of paper, would the resulting pattern be unique just like my fingerprints?","I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be exactly the same as anyone else's, but I'm also pretty sure your own wouldn't be exactly the same every time"
1950,NoStupidQuestions,Am I overthinking or is it a deal breaker?,"new rules moving forward:

1951,NoStupidQuestions,"When black people close their eyes, is it darker than when white people do it?",I bet we could get some data on this from someone with the right type of vitiligo.
1952,NoStupidQuestions,"I'm currently paying for a storage unit that only has a 6 foot 90 pound sex doll in it, can I legally just sell the storage unit?","I mean this is basically a ""how to get rid of a body situation"", except it's legal.

&#x200B;

I'm sure redditors know what to do in this case. Just look up any ""how to get rid of a body"" thread on r/AskReddit. I remember there was this one guy who discovered that his local landfill can dispose of a body for 35 bucks."
1953,NoStupidQuestions,is it ok for boys to cry?,Crying is a very important tool which is necessary for your body and mind to overcome hard times or a trauma. Its normal for a human being to do so. Gender doesnt matter at all.
1954,NoStupidQuestions,How many beards are grown because the person is just too lazy to keep shaving?,Shaving close/shaving daily is a form of torture to me. Could not pay me to do it.
1955,NoStupidQuestions,"In 2012, a gay couple sued a Colorado Baker who refused to bake a wedding cake for them. Why would they want to eat a cake baked by a homophobe on happiest day of their lives?","The gay couple did not sue the baker.  The couple filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, who agreed that it was a clear case of antigay discrimination.  The baker had twice informed them that he didn't serve gay couples. It was the State of Colorado that sued, not the couple.

Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece\_Cakeshop\_v.\_Colorado\_Civil\_Rights\_Commission#Facts\_of\_the\_case

Craig and Mullins visited Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado, in July 2012 to order a wedding cake for their return celebration. Masterpiece's owner Jack Phillips, who is a Christian, declined their cake request, informing the couple that ***he did not create wedding cakes for marriages of gay couples*** owing to his Christian religious beliefs, although the couple could purchase other baked goods in the store. Craig and Mullins promptly left Masterpiece without discussing with Phillips any of the details of their wedding cake.\[2\]: 2  The following day, Craig's mother, Deborah Munn, called Phillips, ***who advised her that Masterpiece did not make wedding cakes for the weddings of gay couples***\[2\]: 2  because of his religious beliefs and because Colorado did not recognize same-sex marriage at the time."
1956,NoStupidQuestions,Is my dog aware that I am not a dog?,"Compare your dog's reaction to seeing other dogs vs. seeing other humans.  This isn't proof, but it's pretty good evidence that your dog knows the difference."

1962,NoStupidQuestions,"If I covered myself in bright colors like the Poison Dart Frog while in the jungle would predators like the Jaguar stay away from me, thinking I was poisonous just like the frog?","Probably not. Most [mullerian mimicry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_mimicry#Aposematism,_camouflage,_and_mimicry) relies on the predator's ability to learn from past experience, though there are some examples of instinct. Adult tigers [primarily feed on large mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_tiger#Hunting_and_diet), not frogs, so they wouldn't have negative experiences to learn from. 

They also rarely eat peacocks, which *are* brightly colored.

Since they routinely hunt animals larger than humans, it might be more effective (not to mention safer) to test the premise of your question by painting or dressing gaur or cattle instead of humans."

If we went with our Chinese housemate they brought us the Chinese menu which was incredible. If we went without him they’d bring us the English menu which had all the common English versions of Chinese food they think you want. They’d always let you have the Chinese menu if you asked for it but without the Chinese housemate they would just assume us non Chinese people want the Englishified version."

1985,NoStupidQuestions,"Why does the year 2020 sound so futuristic, although we are three months away from it?","It could be because a lot of fictional media has used 20XX to denote ""the future"".

1986,NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else keep the light on in another room to feel less lonely and less scared of an empty dark house?,"I’ve always been a lonely person. I’m not close to any of my family members, but when I was a kid, my older brother’s room was down the hall from mine. He used to stay up later than me watching TV at night, and and the light shining into my room was always comforting to me as I was falling asleep. I always felt that, even though we weren’t really friends, there was some kind of connection between us, some kind of unspoken bond in both of us being awake at that hour. When he became a teenager and started closing his bedroom door at night, I used to sneak down the hall to see if the light was still shining under the crack in his door. It wasn’t until later, when he moved out, that I closed my door, too."
1987,NoStupidQuestions,Why haven't we been able to design a dustpan that doesn't leave a line of dirt behind?,"To avoid leaving a line, the edge of the dust pan would have to be around the same height as the thickness of your average dust particle*.  Think of trying to bump a beach ball up some stairs. Unless you can get under the center of gravity of the ball and get some lift, the ball will just bounce of the stair riser. But if the step is half the height or less of the ball, it's possible for it to just roll over the barrier through momentum.

 When you sweep, the dust is doing something similar. It's bouncing and bumping along, impelled by the broom bristles. Any particle that gets some lift will make it into the pan.

But an edge that thin is very sharp knife territory as far as thickness is concerned. And few people would want a razor sharp edge on a dust pan. Second, it has become common for dust pans to have a rubber edge so it can conform to imperfections in the floor better. It is almost impossible to get a razor edge worth flexible polymers and any edge you did get would dull incredibly quickly as soon as you used it.









*a large component of household dust is human shed skin flakes."

1990,NoStupidQuestions,"If I was the last person alive, could I keep key utilities running by myself?","Since you could as the last person alive pick any place you want to live, your best bet would be a farm or any other rural home that has it's own basic utility systems that would be easy to maintain.

It is fairly common that farms have their own water source, and also waste, so you would just have to find one that has also either a wind turbine, or river/stream with a turbine for electricity, and then you are set for life as long as you learn how to operate and maintain the machines, and know where to go to pick up parts.

Internet on the other hand would grind to an halt eventually, and it would be out of your control to keep it up, so best be situated near a big city, so you could fetch books, dvd´s,records, etc for entertainment and information."
1991,NoStupidQuestions,"Are swimmers more likely to drown at some point in their lives because they are in the water so often, or are they less likely because of their prowess in the water?","it seems swimmers (and any other adult).. is a statistical minority.

### WHO IS MOST AT RISK IN THE UNITED STATES?

**Males:** Nearly 80 percent of people who die from drowning in the United States are male.  


**Children:** Children ages 1-4 have the highest drowning rates. In 2014, among children 1-4 years old who died from an unintentional injury, one third died from drowning. Among children ages 1-4, most drownings occur in home swimming pools. Drowning is responsible for more deaths among children ages 1-4 than any other cause except for congenital anomalies (birth defects). Among those 1-14, fatal drowning remains the second leading cause of unintentional injury-related death behind motor vehicle crashes.  


**Minorities:** Between 1999-2010, the fatal unintentional drowning rate for African Americans was significantly higher than that of caucasians across all ages. The disparity is widest among children 5-18 years old. The disparity is most pronounced in swimming pools. African American children ages 5-19 drown in swimming pools at rates 5.5 times higher than caucasians of the same age. This disparity is greatest among those 11-12 years old, where African Americans drowning in swimming pools at rates 10 times those of caucasians.

2008,AskProgramming,"What's ""real"" programming in a day to day job like?","School assignments usually come very well specified. They tell you EXACTLY what your code is supposed to do in all cases. In the industry, a lot of times we get assignments that are at least a bit underspecified. Say you're tasked with implementing a new feature. In a well-structured organization, a UX team gives you UI mockups and a PM has refined the ticket enough to include most of the obvious use cases, but it's usually not bulletproof. Part of your job involves figuring out all of the little details.

There's also the architecture of the whole codebase to consider. There might be some ""quick and easy"" way to hack together some new feature, but if it's violating the architecture then that's no good. You often have to do things in a slightly more verbose way that respects abstraction boundaries.

And if you're working on a serious product that you hope to sell worldwide, there are all sorts of extra layers you have to work with. You can't just throw text on the screen, you have to get translations made for every language you support. You can't just throw components on the screen, you have to make sure it works on all screen sizes, and that it's properly structured and tagged so that it works with screen readers, oh and also make sure you're not using color as the only indicator of something. You can't just throw data in a database, you have to think about security. You might have to make the application behave differently in different regions due to legal issues.

In short, you're almost never doing these little well-specified tricky algorithm things, you're doing things that are much simpler logically, but having to navigate the architecture of a large codebase."
2009,AskProgramming,Does Anyone else feel the Industry is Overly Obsessed with Scrum?,"Process is great. It helps you coordinate and maximize output. Minimizes waste and rework. Great!

But many, many people I have met have more of an obsession with the process itself, rather than with the results it produces. This leads to perverse incentives and weird behavior. Its incredibly common on project managers, because process is their only point of control - so they try to optimize process instead of outputs."
2010,AskProgramming,Why has Windows never been entirely re-rewritten?,"It would cost billions of dollars and take many many years with no guarantee of success, especially since you'd have to keep all the backward compatibility guarantees, and a relatively large opportunity cost given how many engineers would be needed to staff a project of that size, and since Windows has historically been a monopoly, even now the market for Windows licenses is effectively saturated; meaning that even if the project succeeded it's very unlikely it would recoup the investment over any reasonable time frame.

And given that this is Microsoft, even if the codebase was immaculate; formally proven correct; every line well documented; it wouldn't save windows from what people hate about it most, which is all product related, not code related (eg. artificially disabling things so you can ""market segment""; putting advertisements in the fucking start menu, more invasive ""telemetry"" all the time, &tc)."
2011,AskProgramming,Why is C++ such a controversial language?,"When people approach a big language like C++ with fear instead of curiosity the most likely result is that a lot of people would hate the language.


Also, the part that C++ is heavily criticized by big personalities like Linus Torvalds makes a lot of people cargo cult around it, instead of learning the reasons why. Some of the critics are old, some are based in misconceptions about C++ like ""C++ is a weird mess. My new language would increase productivity 50 to 80% over it"" well yes, but only if your problem is in the same set of the new language targets. And that part of ""**My** new language"", C++ is not made by one person anymore, C++ doesn't serve the interest of a single person or a single company but instead a large and diverse group of developers in all kind of industries. A single person can't design a language for the same user group as C++ anymore (and also ISO standardization is a big plus in some industries).


The story of C++ is interesting because *in spite of* everything against it, it is still one of the most successful languages. A lot of big personalities trash talk about C++, even big companies like sun and ibm did their part to trash talk about C++ explicitly, some universities care a lot about what """"the industry"" says and listened to them making professors and new students hate the language as well, and even C++ didn't have a big financial investment. 


So, I think is controversial because of fear and disinformation. [""C++ is there because we can build good systems for people"" - Bjarne](https://youtu.be/_wzc7a3McOs?t=3354)"
2012,AskProgramming,Software development is so toxic why?,"Anyone who looks down on you for being shit at leetcode can safely be ignored. Don't worry about it. Leetcode is broadly totally irrelevant to most people's jobs. You have to remember that this sub isn't just populated by professionals, it's a heady mix of professional coders and amateur coders of all levels of skill, and, as with many pastimes and endeavours, people who mostly just consume social media then regurgitate it in their own words as a substitute to actually knowing WTF they're talking about. 

Hustle porn is bullshit, too. I barely if ever work beyond my contracted hours, and it's done me no harm whatsoever. When I was on the career ladder, I got promoted ahead of others who did put in the extra hours. Don't do it.

2014,AskProgramming,Is it me or has Google's search engine gotten worse?,"A lot of people blame SEO but over the last few years google have started implementing some algorithm that tries to guess user intent.

So you add quotes, hopefully trying to force the search into finding appropriate results but it 

This fails miserably weirdos like us know what we're searching for.

2016,AskProgramming,I accidentaly wrote C++ in my CV insted of C#. How fucked am I?,"I don't really think it's as big a deal as others are making it. I've had interns on my teams who were just starting out. This was their first time using the language we use and first time writing real code for a real company. They did fine and learned a lot. We don't expect an intern to come in and start contributing right away. It's a learning experience for them.

I would probably still correct it if I were you, but if I were the company you sent it to and you sent me the correction, I'd think it's not a big deal and continue with the process anyway.

2022,AskProgramming,"I recently discovered Vim and it's amazing. What other great tools are there in the programming world, that beginners might not know about?"," - `man` is freaking underrated, seems like people rather use SO/websearch (same for documentation)
 - `redshift`
 - obv. learn the basic tools such as `dd`/`cat`, `tac`, `uniq`, `sort`, `tr`, `xargs` etc.
 - learn how to use regex (for `sed`, `grep` etc.); but also learn when *not* to use regex!
 - `ktrace`, `strace` or whatever else there is depending on the OS
 - netcat (ie. `nc`) & `curl`
 - for analysing binaries: `radare2`, `ROPgadget`, `objdump`, `readelf`, `strings`, `ldd`, `file`
 - switch to Spacemacs ;)
 - use vim-bindings for your shell & REPLs
 - use tmux with `\` as prefix (UK layout)
 - tiling window manager
 - rebind your keys (I swapped esc & caps, right-shift to switch to last used workspace in XMonad, use PrtSc as modifier for certain combos to have utf8 symbols)

2023,AskProgramming,Hackers have put up source code for Cyberpunk 2077 online for sell for $10k. What would be in that that would be actually worth paying?

2024,AskProgramming,What programming research papers every programmer should read?,"I don’t think there are any. There’s a huge range of programming subfields and no single topic applies to all of them. Plus, most programmers can get by just fine without research papers. I think research is for the small slice of programmers who really want to push the industry forward or who just enjoy learning from research for its own sake.

That said, here are some papers which I, personally, found enjoyable or formative, and which others might like as well. They are in no particular order. Some of them I know well, some I know influenced me but I no longer remember the details of, and some I enjoyed or consider important but never finished reading. For full transparency I’ve marked the ones that I believe are important (to my personal interests) but not read deeply with an asterisk.

I want to stress again that I don’t see any of these as “required reading”, and even though I consider them important to my interests I haven’t always done a good job of reading them myself. But if you’re interested in any of them it might be worth taking a look, and if you have questions about why any of these are on my list I can answer to the best of my recollection.

If you enjoy reading papers you’ll probably like [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/). A significant number of the papers I’ve read are due to them. If you do this a lot it may also help if you get acquainted with SciHub.

2026,AskProgramming,What would a cat use programming for?,"You might know that cats don't have [object permanence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence), so object oriented programming is completely out the window. As well as global variables must go (or at least allowing functions to modify global varaibles must go). The only things that can change are the things immediately in front of you.

Cats don't do anything until absolutely required, this you may call being 'lazy'. This should be reflected in your programming language as [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation).

Cats have seven lives. Your programming language should tolerate errors exactly 7 times until it halts. Basically, act like javascript for the first 7 errors and just slap some default value or just ignore that line. One you hit the 8th error, crash over the most inane thing like adding an integer to a float. You could even require semicolons, but only after the first seven non-semicoloned line.

2030,AskProgramming,Why is programming so cognitively expensive?,"To answer the title question, I think it's pretty obvious: Programming is abstract problem solving in it's purest form. We're constantly using and abusing a part of our brain that originally evolved to let us be slightly better hunters and gatherers via planning, and pushing it to its logical extreme. No wonder it's exhausting.

To answer the actual question of the post, work less. If you're actually putting in 36-40 hours a week of actual programming time, you're doing at least twice, if not twice again more programming than the typical full time job demands. Most SWE I know (myself included) spend maybe 15 hours a week programming, about that same amount doing random documentation and sometimes sales support type stuff, and a combination of either pretending or not even pretending to work the other 10 hours in a full-time work week."
2031,AskProgramming,How do browsers use so much ram?,"Well, one part of it is sandboxing. Modern web browsers run a completely seperate engine for each tab. So all the memory needed to fire up a parsing engine for HTML and CSS, plus the JavaScript interpreter is allocated to each tab.

https://example.com, for example, takes 36 kilobytes of RAM on my machine.

2041,AskProgramming,"This Github repo compiles ""Hello World"" in different languages, and measures the startup time of the binaries. How come FreePascal programs are so fast?","First, I don't think that's an interesting benchmark. Optimizing for a do nothing program would not be high in my list of priorities if I was making a C compiler (or a standard C library; the difference is there, in the initialization of the runtime)

If I run that benchmark on my computer, I get:

    C (gcc 9.3.0):            0.27 ms
    Pascal (fpc 3.0.4):       0.08 ms

But I remark that the C executable is dynamically linked against their runtime libraries when the Pascal one isn't. Just forcing a static link for C (adding -static to CFLAGS in the Makefile) I get

    C (gcc 9.3.0):            0.13 ms
    Pascal (fpc 3.0.4):       0.08 ms

explaining already a big part of the difference. Looking at the disassembly (compile with -g, objdump -dS), one see that glibc does a lot of things in the initialization, far more than the Pascal version. But glibc is full of features and some of them need unnecessary optimization here, there are other libc which are aiming to reduce that kind of overhead, for instance dietlibc. Compiling for dietlibc, I get

    C (diet gcc 9.3.0):       0.08 ms
    Pascal (fpc 3.0.4):       0.08 ms

putting C on par with Pascal."

For #1, I will *always* recommend Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers. It's all about adding tests to untested codebases, and it's basically a recipe book for ""I have this problem / what are my options""?

---

> I find myself trying to manage the explosion of code complexity by stubbing every function, but then I'm not testing the unit as a whole, I'm testing each function individually.

The trick is to find good module boundaries. WEWLC calls these ""seams"". To add tests to an untested codebase, you need to identify and then exploit the seams that are already present. You can also perform purely mechanical but safe refactorings to introduce new seams. As you increase your test coverage, you can become bolder in the types of refactorings that you make.

You may need to erect ""scaffolding"" in order to get things tested, even though you might later tear down that scaffolding. That's OK."

2045,AskProgramming,When is trying to do functional programming going too far? How do I push back?,">an if statement (e.g. will create a function like ""throwIf""), never write a loop, never declare variables,

None of this has anything to do with functional programming. Just shitty programming. 

Recursion is looping in almost all examples of it. The reason functional programmers use map/reduce/etc is because it better captures the nature of the loop. A mapping function generates a new data structure like the current one. A reduce function is a loop that builds a completely new data structure out of an existing one, usually starting from some initial seed. 

>How do I deal with this? How do I push back against this as a member of the team?

Ask him to justify how these changes are functional in nature. Ask for articles recommending this style. Try to sound like you're interested in learning about this. To me it sounds like your lead developer isn't qualified for the position, so it's going to be difficult to make him understand that without being accusatory. Honestly, it may be easier to talk to your manager and possibly just asking to be put on a different team as you don't believe in your team lead."

I don't have much specific advice for you. Your colleagues are trying to be encouraging, so it makes the situation pretty delicate.

I suspect you'll experience this more in more left-leaning companies (typically startups, but also much of silicon valley), so moving company might help if it really bothers you.

2056,AskProgramming,Any disabled programmers out there?,"Sorry about your condition.

Software development is not mainly about writing code and the limiting factor is not how many words you can type per minute, it's how fast, and how good, your brain works. So, it's not an insurmountable obstacle.

However, your keyboard is obviously what you use to bring your thoughts into digital reality. So not being able to type is going to slow you down, probably significantly. The stuff you write is not normal english words, it's a bunch of speciallyFormattedWords with_weird $special_characters, and also a bunch of technical jargon you won't find in any english dictionary. Probably a tough nut for voice-to-text to crack.

But, as you become more and more senior, you can actually move away more from writing code so much. You can move into architecture which is more about design, flowcharts and diagrams, and less about code implementations. And there's lots of room for technical people in management as well. You would still be writing though, emails, technical documents etc. But those could be written more easily with voice-to-text. 

If this interests you, look into Software Engineering, as opposed to just programming or development. It requires broader knowledge, but it's less about just typing lines of code. It's more intellectual work and less assembly-line type code monkey stuff.

So, you're definitely at a disadvantage, but you probably are in most fields to be honest. And even though I don't have personal experience, I'd reckon it's definitely doable if you've got some grit and determination.

Good luck!"
2057,AskProgramming,Is there any hope for getting work as a self-taught programmer?,"A GitHub definitely feels more normal but isn’t required.
You’ve got more experience than I did when I got my first dev job. 

What fields are you looking in? I’d say the most popular beginner field is web development, and you don’t seem to have as much experience with that as much as making desktop projects. Which is not at all a bad thing, but some hiring team(without a dev) won’t connect the dots and think you aren’t right for the job if you don’t explicitly have front end experience.

Before I go further I’d probably ask what branch of programming/computer science you are looking for a job in.

2058,AskProgramming,What are some techniques every programmer should learn in 2020 ?,"I can tell you the things I wish I'd practiced with more before getting a real job:

1. Writing documentation

2. Git

3. Docker, terraform, jenkins, cloud stuff

4. SSL, GPG, OAuth, API and access tokens

5. Active Directory, LDAP, bitlocker, and the various tools companies use to limit access to resources

6. Not me, but I know people who are clueless when it comes to databases.

7. Packaging and distributing software. Every developer should know how to create a .deb, or .rpm.

8. Testing: every developer should know unit testing, integration testing, regression testing, fuzzing, mocking, test harnesses, and at least know the basic ideas bhind test driven development.

9. Agile. You don't need to be an adherant, but it's a bid part of the industry and you should know the vocabulary at least.

10. I wish I had practice looking at some internally created tool that's 5,000 lines of code with documentation that is unhelpful at best, and a lie at worst. In the real world, your boss tells you that they're using something and you don't get to be like ""oh, well what is this steaming pile of crap on github? I think it'd be easier to just roll my own solution than try to understand this."" Likewise, in the real world, if you encounter a weird error and no one on StackOverflow knows how to fix it, then you don't get to just give up and do something else. You've been given a job and if it takes you all of a week to decompile that shit into assembly and email the original author and sacrifice a chicken to Baal so that he might end your sisyphean suffering, then that's what your week will be like. So you better learn how to solve unsolvable problems.

11. I personally wish I had known more networking stuff. Being able to set up a proxy with pass-through authentication, or a corporate VPN or whatever (or just knowing enough to know that's a thing I want to do) is useful."

2060,AskProgramming,Is there any hard evidence that functional programming is better?,"Better has a lot of meanings.

Does better mean faster? FP is not necessarily faster, and can often be slightly slower (there’s overhead in maintaining a call stack, you can’t easily do optimizations such as loop unrolling, etc)

Does better mean easier to understand? Well for a lot of people it’s much easier to understand a for-loop vs a map-reduce, and if you mean single paradigm FP languages, things like atoms, closures, currying, and monads are generally less understood (probably because PP and OOP are primarily taught in school).

Does better mean easier to test and maintain? For me this is where FP is a clear winner. There’s something beautiful about writing tiny functions that can be 100% covered and have zero side effects.

As a result, I tend to follow the hybrid approach of “use FP as inspiration for writing beautiful code”."
2061,AskProgramming,Why is Java More Popular Than C#?,"I'd assume that most companies run their servers on Linux and at least in the beginning that wasn't really an option for C# server applications. 

Once a company chose such a technology stack, it's pretty hard to switch to something else."
2062,AskProgramming,What is the worst programming language?,"There's a whole family of intentionally terrible programming languages.

The grandfather of the group is brainfuck, which demonstrates Turing completeness with only a handful of esoteric symbols.

A related language is Cow, which adds a couple of flow control commands, then for flavor every command is some capitalization of Moo (except a few, like oom and OOO).  It is a language that purports to be readable by cows.

In a similar vein there's whitespace, which has a handful of commands, each made up of a sequence of a couple of spaces, tabs, or line feeds--every printable character is ignored.  Whitespace is notable for being impossible to print on paper--you have to make whitespace characters visible to even begin to read it, and that's before addressing the difficulty in formulating a program in the language.

A final language of note is Malbolge, which is a terrible programming language where a lot more design went into making it unusable.  It operates in trinary to alienate programmers who are used to binary, and to determine what command to execute the program it goes through a convoluted process of computing essentially (in C notation) `(*c + c) % 94`, after which only 7 of the 94 possible results actually does anything (one of them ending the program).  To make things worse, it scrambles each instruction after running it, making loops exceptionally painful to devise.

Languages that aren't designed to be terrible are usually much, much better, but that's not to say they're all good.  I haven't been too offended by mainstream languages, but in working with some embedded devices I've run across a few languages where it's clear someone threw together a language without really understanding what makes a language good or bad.  The worst offended, which I won't name to protect the innocent, comes from an embedded device that's responsible for some task but allows users to additionally run their own code alongside that task.  Features include:

* You can use `=`, `==`, or `equals` in your program.  Each of these is completely identical.  They each mean either assignment or a check for equality, which must be deduced from context.

* There are comments, like in any good programming language.  Some of these comments do things.  It's up to the programmer to know which comments are actually comments and which ones are code that is put into a comment block.

* The language allows you to define variables that represent only a single bit of some larger variable.  It also allows you to check these against what appear to be constants named ""ON"" and ""OFF.""  This is great for simple cases, where you could set up a variable named input to represent a single bit of a digital input, then check `if input = ON`.  The struggle comes from combining these: if you have input1 and input2 then checking if they're both in the same state can't be `if input1 == input2` or even `if (input1 equals ON) && (input2 = ON)`.  Logically that's correct, but `= ON` doesn't resolve to 1 or 0--it just bitmasks and leaves the result in whichever position.  You have to write out the entire `if ((input1 = ON) && (input2 == ON)) || ((input1 equals OFF) && (input2 = OFF))`.

It's a language and a product that ultimately get their job done, but man I'd love to go and clean up some of their design decisions."
2063,AskProgramming,What features of programming languages do people OVER use?,"Terseness and ""one-liners"". This is especially true in functional languages. I prefer every line of code to have the same amount of ""thought"" required for it, so it can be read at a consistent speed.

2075,AskProgramming,"Bad software engineer, how to get gud?","Man. That's some shit.

Well...it sounds like it's a tough spot you're in. 

One thing id say is definitely don't feel bad about burdening people at your job. They hired you knowing your experience. They don't expect you to be good right now. They expect you to learn as fast as you can, but ultimately you are an investment.

Seek out a mentor at your job, someone who can basically be your coach, and help make sure you know the fundamentals and what you need to do to effectively do your job. Ideally it's the prick with 20 years experience. Win him over. Get his knowledge.

Since you're just starting out, I suggest you spend an hour each morning (either at work if you can convince them or at home before hand) practicing programming. Practice git. Practice using your IDE, your debugger, writing tests, language features and syntax, refactoring cleanly, and reading books like Design Patterns and Clean Code. You're entering into a tough world. There's a shit ton to learn and you don't know any of it. It's not gonna be much easier elsewhere. There's simply a learning curve that you need to overcome as quickly as you can, and until you do it's probably going to be uncomfortable. Knowing that though, what this job should be to you is an avenue to get you knowledge from your job experience and your access to senior engineers.

If this senior dev is a prick, so what. Use him. He's on your team. He's smart. Suck out his knowledge like a fucking vampire and build a relationship with him anyway and then job hop in a year or 2 for a big raise."

At no point does the algorithm know what input data it received.

It's an active research topic and I'm not currently aware of a Fully Homomorphic encrypted search engine, nor am I aware if it has been proven impossible to do. I believe mathematically this would require a proof saying one is impossible to fully deem it impossible, much like the P vs NP argument. Until someone actually produces such a framework, it's an open question whether or not one can exist. Some nuances to keep in mind are whether a general framework exists like a turing complete general computer, or whether one can exist in extremely well defined languages (domain specific problems like search, machine learning training, graphics rendering, etc.)."

2087,AskProgramming,My professor recommends us making a GitHub account as soon as possible. Why should I?,"the entire (modern) programming industry uses git.

the sooner you start getting used to git, be it github, gitlab, your own repository on a pi somewhere, the better.

on top of that, during your university years you will more than likely build projects which are passable to show off, but will be left collecting dust on a USB-stick somewhere before it gets reformatted to host as storage for three three horror movies during movie night.

2089,AskProgramming,Can anyone please tell me what on Earth is RESTful?,"In short, REST is a standardized design pattern.

2091,AskProgramming,Is “x' = f(x)” a programming paradigm?,"You didn't use the terminology, but what you're describing essentially sounds like a [persistent data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure); it ""persists"" after ""modification"" because you always return copies instead of modifying in-place. They tend to require a *lot* more allocation, but by using tree structures instead of large, flat arrays, you can avoid copying large amounts of data. But the need to allocate memory and have indirection does make them a lot slower than their non-persistent counterparts. So, specifically, you often require O(log n) additional allocations per write and O(log n) pointer indirections per read. So this scales okay-ish for very large inputs, but with a massive constant overhead since indirections are so much slower than dealing directly with contiguous arrays.

> If we generalize the problem a bit, we can say that the difficulty comes in trying to model a system where the entire state of the system represented as X needs to be transformed in to a new state X' via a pure function F without constantly making copies of old state (kills performance)

However, there's a recent research paper called [Perceus: Garbage Free Reference Counting with Reuse](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/11/perceus-tr-v1.pdf) which is effectively designed to optimize this kind of code; it has been implemented in [Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html) an experimental functional language from Microsoft Research and also in [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/) a very new pure functional programming language intended for app development. Essentially, it allows the programmer to write pure functional code which appears to be copying its input, but a combination of ahead-of-time static analysis and runtime dynamic refcount checks will convert these into mutations whenever possible.

They describe this paradigm as ""**functional, but in-place**"": you write code as though you're copying, but the compiler emits in-place mutation. So you can reason around your code as though it's purely functional, but its performance characteristics are much closer to plain imperative code.

In practice, for realistic code, Perceus can apparently achieve performance very close to in-place mutation, because the static analysis is ""easy"" in the cases where it's most helpful, and whenever the static analysis fails, there's a dynamic analysis (check the refcount); and whenever the dynamic analysis fails (performing a copy) you get a new unique object which allows the optimization to kick in. So as long as you're willing to put up with the (low-ish) overhead of reference counting (e.g. you're not bound by hard constraints on latency etc. that are effectively only handled by C/Ada/Fortran/C++/Rust/...) you can use Perceus to make persistent data structures fast."
2092,AskProgramming,Why do entry level jobs demand 3-4 years of experience ?,"As a general rule of thumb, subtract 2 years from requested experience. 3-4 years might actually be looking for some one with *some* professional experience, but if they say they want 1-2 years of experience, they'll probably take a fresh grad. 

The situation arrises in a number of ways, but mostly it boils down to an absence of communication between engineering (who wants to hire someone) and hr (who write job postings). Engineering wants someone familiar with a tool, hr translates that into a couple years of experience with a tool that anyone could pick up in a month. It's not HR's fault per se,  learning new ""resume-relevant skills"" is just a lot more common in software than it is most other fields."

That's where our friends at StackOverflow come into the picture! They're generally experienced, they know where to look for the answers, and they are more than happy to pass along what they've picked up.

2096,AskProgramming,Why is Uncle Bob so hated in programming community?,"I don't think there's a single reason- a lot of people have independently written him off for a lot of different reasons. I'd say you can group the complaints broadly into 4 categories:

1. People think that his books are over-rated
2. People disagree with his technical opinions generally
3. People disagree with his views on leadership and team dynamics
4. People disagree with his social views and don't want to be associated with them by recommending him.

To address these one-by-one:

First: He's written several books. Clean Code is the most well known. Most of these books are full of a mix of common sense that you could learn anywhere, bad advice that nobody should learn, and things that made sense in a very particular sort of corporate culture in the late 90's and early 2000's but are no longer relevant. His writing style is fine, it'll seem persuasive to someone who has never read that style of writing before, and the books are mostly read by people who are too inexperienced to recognize that they aren't that good. More experienced people are frustrated by this.

Second: People tend to disagree with his general technical opinions. He's a TDD and pair programming zealot, and those are decisive opinions, so he was always going to lose some people there. He's also very much still steeped in the early 2000's everything-is-an-object OOP mindset, and has written extensively about disliking both static type systems (which he seems to think compete with testing for some reason) and functional programming at a time when they are getting much more popular.

Third: This is a partial restatement of the last point, but generally I'd say it's fair to say that he's not actually a developer these days. His real job is being an Agile consultant, and he advocates for a particular flavor of agile process that removes a lot of agency from individual engineers. His approach to running software teams turns every team into a feature factory where engineers are fungible and nobody does deep work or has real ownership. Most people find this kind of environment soul sucking.

Fourth: He's said some stuff on his blogs and on twitter that are either directly racist or misogynistic, or indirectly supportive of other people who have said racist or misogynistic things. I don't know the details, I stopped following or caring about him long before that happened because of all of the technical reasons. In any rate, most people these days seem to see talking about him much as a signal that you agree with his stance on those things, and so people who don't agree with that stance are distancing themselves from him. That said, I think most of the industry realize that his books are still regularly suggested to people who don't know much about him, and so I think it carries as much weight as people assume socially."
2097,AskProgramming,"Where can I learn to be a developer, not just a programmer?","Are you talking about learning things like Agile and the process of planning out the system? Like, the process, and ideas, of software design and architecture? If so, I’ve got some good books we used that I can drop a reference to."
2098,AskProgramming,Why is accessing some random element near the start of an array FASTER than accessing a random element near the end?,"The vector itself has some metadata, such as total extent, bucket size, and an array of said buckets(buffers), and this metadata is allocated near the start of the memory block.  So, you access a vector, it has to touch the metadata (object properties) first, then access the proper place in memory.  Elements near the start are already in the L1 cache since the object header was just accessed.  Elements near the end are on different pages / different places in the RAM bus, the mother board's memory controller typically has a RAM cache too.

TL;DR: Similar place in memory accessed twice is faster than two vastly different pages of memory accessed in succession."
2099,AskProgramming,does anyone else feel like a fake?,"Are you kidding? We, the engineers of computer science, do this all the time. [Key-Value pair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBM_(computing\)) databases existed long before SQL technology was invented. Yet, in the last 15 years, it got ""accidentally"" rediscovered as noSQL database. Google even patented an old idea around iteration by simply naming said old idea to a [new one](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce).

You're not alone.

On a side note, why do I feel like you're promoting your Rust project?"
2100,AskProgramming,ELI5 what is dynamic programming?,"Dynamic programming is a way of breaking problems up into repeated subproblems, then solving the subproblems from the bottom up, reusing any answers that you’ve already figured out. 

Consider a naive recursive Fibonacci function:

```
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```
I’m on mobile so I’ll use notation “fn” to mean `fib(n)`. 

f5 = f4 + f3 

f5 = (f3 + f2) + f3

Now I’ll expand the f3 calls.

f5 = ((f2 + f1) + f2) + (f2 + f1)

Now I’ll expand all the f2 calls. 

f5 = (((f1 + f0) + f1) + (f1 + f0)) + ((f1 + f0) + f1)

Now let’s look at how many times fib got called. 

-	f0: 3 times
-	f1: 5 times
-	f2: 3 times
-	f3: 2 times

For f0 and f1, this isn’t a huge deal. But we had to calculate f2 twice more than necessary and f3 once more than necessary. This is ok for `fib(5)` but it won’t be ok for `fib(100)`.

Since the nth Fibonacci number builds on the last two,  and this logic will unroll all the way down to 1, we should only need to calculate fx once for each x less than n.

```
fib_dynamic(n):
  if n is 1 or 0 return n
  fibs = [0, 1] // fibs[x] represents the xth Fibonacci number
  for i from 2 to n, inclusive:
    fibs[i] = fibs[i - 1] + fibs[i - 2]
  return fibs[i]
```

Try out fib_dynamic(5) on pen and paper and see the difference. 

With this method, we don’t have to repeat any work because we saved the intermediate answers to be used again. 

There exists another technique very similar to dynamic programming, called *memoization* (yes, that’s how you spell it), where you essentially save the results of each function call, then the next time that function is called with the same arguments you can return the saved version. This is often a little bit easier to implement because you don’t have to change your algorithm to go bottom-up, the stack will do it for you.

```
cache = [0, 1]
fib_memo(n):
  if cache[n] exists, return it
  cache[n] = fib_memo(n - 1) + fib_memo(n - 2)
  return cache[n]
```

Try this one out on pen and paper too, see how it compares to the other two."

2103,AskProgramming,Why do programming communities feel so difficult to get involved in?,"> I feel as if I can't contribute anything, even on projects desperately needing help. Only contribution I'm ever able to make it seems is making my own projects using the existing framework as a tool. Get a couple of ""that's cool"" based on how pretty it looks, and my existence is once again ignored.

It's harsh to say it, but just because a project is desperate for contributions it doesn't mean they have to lower their standards. You wouldn't submit gibberish essays to a newspaper that's in desperate need of stories, or a childish drawing to an art gallery in desperate need of paintings\*. 

So why can something be accepted into a project simply because ""it works""? It might be rejected as an issue of style, which can often feel petty, or it might be a  issue of technical debt. Sure, your solution works **now** and therefore fixed a short term problem, but if it sets up multiple long term problems then is it worth taking? The ideal solution fixes the problem and does no harm whilst doing so!

Of course this is a hypothetical. 


As for your comments about pedantry and snark: that kind of thing is rampant on places like stackoverflow, and a bit in Reddit. (Especially in this comment ;)).

 I think it's mostly down to over exposure.and a (perceived?) lack of effort in the questioners part. Do you know how many questions I see in various subreddits each week that are duplicates of each other? Like not even subtle duplicates, but the exact same question with the exact same ""personal story"" attached to them. Examples are;

* How do I start learning language X?
* Does anyone have examples of projects I could complete to practice programming?
* I'm intermediate/advanced and need some help  (usually accompanied by amazingly advanced credentials such as.""I've just learnt while loops"")
* Very obvious copy + pastes of their homework assignments,except.they manage to omit half of the original question and so no one can help them
* Badly formatted code with nonsensical and illiterate requests for help

It's daily. So much so that I don't answer them often, as I wouldn't be able to do so politely. (Hint: the answers are always in the sidebar, or in the other 5 identical.questions asked this week, or available as the first result on Google when entering that exact question or error xode). But OP obviously put no effort into finding them, which feels like a deliberate and personal attack on the time of the people volunteering their time to help a stranger in the internet. If I do feel like answering, perhaps because no one else has, it's often limited to a ""what have you tried?"" or just a link to Google, which never gets a reply.

So it's quite hard to answer the perpetual tide of newbie questions without being worn down by them which results in being rude (either intentionally or unintentionally)

2104,AskProgramming,"Learning C and C++ as a hobbie. Any leads, tips or perhaps tutorials?","If you like music and audio, that could be a fun area to explore.

2106,AskProgramming,What are the most useful mathematical concepts in software?,"Until you get into ""soft"" things like machine learning/data analysis/etc, or things involving media, as far as I can tell the most useful math is basic algebra, statistics, and logic, plus theories that aren't actually number-related that show up in FP.

Every area of programming has different math. I can't remember the last time I ever used anything like calculus, and some people use it daily.

&#x200B;

I have not actually done so, but I suspect learning about proofs would be more useful than most math for typical programmers. Being able to write a comment that explains ""These two functions that use this lock will never deadlock because X"" seems like it's probably related to math proofs somehow.

Are there any free resources specifically aimed at teaching formal reasoning about programs, beyond the usual stuff that most programmers just pick up?"
2107,AskProgramming,"How does the ""AI"" work in old RTS games?","most ais do cheat, but not in the way you are thinking.

for one, most rts ais don't respect ""fog of war"". they know exactly where you are and what you're doing. it's similar to how most fighting game ais actually determine what they are going to do based on your inputs.

they may not have shorter build times or get free resources, but most of them operate at superhuman levels of speed. it might take you half a second to hit a couple hotkeys to queue the production of a unit, or place a building. ais typically do this orders of magnitude more quickly. this advantage just snowballs over the course of a game.

with those two advantages, it's not that hard to develop an ai that's really difficult and seems like it's more advanced than it really is. hard-code a few decisions - if they make x, i make y; favor attacking when they are away from defenses; only attack when i know i have more units - and combine that with more efficient resource management and knowing exactly where you are at all times, and you have something that's hard to beat.

combine that with the sense that most rts game design is slightly advanced rock-paper-scissors, too. there's a lot of surface level complexity with tons of units and such, but most of the time game designers are going ""i need to design a unit that tempers the strength of this other unit"" and so they immediately know strengths and weaknesses to inform ai decisions."
2108,AskProgramming,Why are C API functions are badly named?,"because C was invented in a time and on a machine where memory and computing power was scarce and extremely expensive, so short names made sense. Shorter names meant saving on compile time and memory usage. Also input methods were very clunky back then, that also might be one of the reasons."
2109,AskProgramming,"A lecturer, on a side note, said that if at all possible, always stay as far away from C and C++ and use other tools instead. Does this make any sense?","You should always use tools of the highest abstraction level that allow you to solve your problem within efficiency constraints. This is because many lower level automation mechanisms save you work and include the quality of the overall solution, as you ""build on the shoulders of giants.""

Ideas you can reuse, without building your own:

1) Garbage collection

2) Operating system portability

The reason to choose a lower level interface is to handle two situations:

1) You want to UNDERSTAND the underneath

2) you can not satisfy the operational / efficiency needs at the current level of abstraction.

Just like math, you don't need to understand the fundamental theorem of calculus to measure the speed of a car with a sensor. You don't need to understand assembly to make a webpage. BUT, it is fun and enriching to spend some of your time understanding the deep underneath."

2. Japanese cars use NEC, Hitachi (Renesas) etc.  American cars use US brands, the Germans use European brand like Infineon.
3. In the past all the semconductor companies designed their own CPUs but these days they almost all license ARM cores.
4. Most of the CPUs in current cars are actually 8 and 16-bit and mostly do simple jobs but the overall trend is toward 32-bit ARM processors.
5. It's a massive and growing market so the manufacturers are desperate to get their chips in cars but the software is growing 10x faster so the tools are more important than the CPU - ARM has the biggest tools and engineer base."

2113,AskProgramming,Why has RESTful become the accepted way to handle data rather than stateful?,"REST for example is great when it comes to scalability, because if you do it right, you have no dependencies between your service instances (i.e. all the state you need to handle the request is part of the request), so you can just chuck in new servers without having to worry about a central bottleneck."
2114,AskProgramming,How to explain to managers why 'just copy from how someone else does it' is not necessarily trivial?,"Layman here but let me give it a shot. Building A is them. Building B is you. Building A has a toilet. Your boss wants a toilet for building B. Building A already has all the necessary plumbing to install this full functioning toilet. Building B requires you to tear up the floor, install piping, connect to the main, etc.

So maybe tell your boss that you can put the code in but it won't function and may cause a mound of shit."

2121,AskProgramming,I got fired from my first software dev job due to performance issue. What can I do?,"Based on the context you provided, it simply sounds like they didn't hire enough dev resources to support onboarding a fresh grad. They assumed the lead would be able to support you well enough to begin contributing at a similar level to them in 6 months. That's a big ask for a new grad (and in my experience it's a big ask for most new hires at that level).

My advice is to don't let that discourage you. Being fired sometimes doesn't say as much about you as it does the environment you were in. Take as much time as you can afford to shake it off and start the job hunt again. You are under no obligation to put them on your resume or use them as references if you don't want to. Your career has just started, you've got so much more time to improve."
2122,AskProgramming,Anyone else not impressed with GPT's coding skills?,"I've found it very useful for isolated and easily testable pieces of code. I wouldn't trust it for much more past that in its current state, though."
2123,AskProgramming,Why do so many websites have JS errors all the time?,"> Why don't people, even at such highly-visited sites like google, care about those errors?

> I mean, the site still work

You've answered your own question :)

To answer your other question, try the site with different browsers and you should notice you get different errors, leading to the (valid) conclusion that different browsers (including different versions of the ""same"" browser) interpret JS differently, and getting a site to work with most browsers is hard enough without having to worry about harmless errors.

By way of analogy, if you've ever compiled a Linux program using the standard `sh configure && make && make install`, you'll see dozens of warnings that people normally ignore provided the install ultimately works.

The general rule is ""fix it first, figure out what caused the error later"", except, after you've fixed it, you don't care what caused the error and don't even care if the error still exists."
2124,AskProgramming,Why do people dislike Java?,"Some people don't like how it forces everything into OOP, even when it's not a good fit. Some consider it overly verbose and/or inelegant."
2125,AskProgramming,Will WebAssembly ever achieve mainstream status?,"I think people often incorrectly assume that the way most new technologies will be used is directly by the developer. It hardly ever happens this way.

When Websockets first came out everyone was trying to think how it would affect them, but what we end up with in the end is you install some framework and you enable the websockets option and you're using websockets without having to understand what's going on in the framework.

I think the same thing will happen with WebAssembly, a new framework or IDE will come with a setting somewhere 'Use WebAssembly' and you'll tick the option and you'll have WebAssembly as a deployment option.

Really just have to be patient until that framework comes along."
2126,AskProgramming,"What is ""enterprise"" Java code and how it different from normal Java code?","Depending on the context, could just refer to the overabstraction and massive boilerplate pieces common in large enterprise code bases. 

See enterprise fizzbuzz: https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition"
2127,AskProgramming,How do developers get their UI to look exactly the same on mobile and inside the browser?,"Speaking as a react centric web developer, we'll write the core app once, which takes care of mobile browsers, desktop browsers and desktop apps (via Electron), and then we'll slap a React Native view on top of it for Android and iOS. The react native parts are basically just a thin presentation layer on top of the abstract business logic so it's not horrible to upkeep."
2128,AskProgramming,How can I be ready for competitive programming?,"Competitive programming is less about what languages you know and more about how many data structures and algorithms you have memorized. Study up really hard on that and pick 1 language to get really really intimate with, python or java are great choices."
2129,AskProgramming,Ultimate noob question. Can I program/compile with a shit 150 dollar laptop? Are there online compilers so I can actually run programs?,"Yes, you can. Simple programs are not resource intensive most of the time.

Depending on what math you want to do, it will just take longer or shorter to complete a calculation. But you don't really have anything to worry about, $150 laptop is fine.

Online compilers are a pain in the ass, but they exist."
2130,AskProgramming,Covid causing this field to become oversaturated?,"there's always a ton of people who want to code. a lot can't do it period, and while the majority can do it if they try hard enough, the majority of that group won't make it over the initial difficulty barrier. After that a lot of people, even with cs degrees, end up hating the work and can't stand doing it 40 hours a week. I don't see it becoming overly saturated, I do however see a lot of people ending up with student debt they got nothing from and a ton of bootcamps making good money.  Good programmers, working on harder, lower-level stuff, will never be saturated, that's how I look at it. if you're shooting to be a front end web monkey...things may be different."
2131,AskProgramming,How and why did GitLab suddenly overtake GitHub in popularity (at least for Java developers)?,"GitLab has been dominant in self-hosted territory for ages. Java is a corporation language, and corporations self-host.

add two and two together and boom, GitLab."
2132,AskProgramming,Why is inheritance taught so early and prominently in school?,"I agree that it's out-of-vogue these days, especially b/c it creates some problems.

But things like interfaces--which arose from inheritance--are still incredibly useful.

But inheriting implementation has, indeed, proved to be troublesome, and we have better patterns now.

It's still a good tool for UIs."

2134,AskProgramming,What are the differences between a REST api and other APIs?,"REST stands for REpresentational* State Transfer.

According to Wikipedia

> A RESTful Web service is required to provide an application access to its Web resources in a textual representation and support reading and modification of them with a stateless protocol and a predefined set of operations.

JSON is completely seperate. You can have a RESTful API that exclusively uses xml, or an API using exclusively JSON which is not RESTful.

2135,AskProgramming,I don't feel like I'm getting any experinece ever - is that normal?,Keep a log of everything you've done at every job and update it daily/weekly. This comes in handy when asking for raises as well.

2137,AskProgramming,"With the latest recommendations, why is it a bad idea to use OAuth2 for authentication?

2138,AskProgramming,Is being able to solve an issue *without* using Stack Overflow an important skill?,"Usually the actually interesting problems are not something SO can solve for you, at least in my last job."
2139,AskProgramming,Why is Electron so huge?,"> Electron is headless Chrome/Blink, no? 

It's not headless. Headless means no graphics (or rather, no display).

The thing that make web browsers huge is the html/css renderer and the javascript engine. If you remove that electron is useless."
2140,AskProgramming,Is there any record of a company using the recruiting process to actually scam programmers for free work?,"It happens all the time, but I've never heard of someone successfully suing for this.

Whenever it happens the developer goes over to Glassdoor and writes a furious review of the interview process, only to find numerous other reviews by other, equally cheated developers.

The lesson here is to check Glassdoor before you start the interview process, and avoid such companies like the plague."
2141,AskProgramming,What does it mean to emulate a CPU?,Emulating a cpu could be useful if the hardware isn’t even made yet. A cpu emulator will behave just like the actual hardware in the sense that you feed it instructions and then it performs them.
2142,AskProgramming,How do programs draw to the screen?,"ultimately there is some RAM that represents the content of the screen. It will actually reside on a graphics chip somewhere but the OS memory maps it so it appears to be addressable by the cpu, usually at a fixed address. This portion of memory will be blitted to the sceen 60 times a second or whatever. If you know the address you can read or overwrite any part of what is displayed, and not too long ago if you were making a fullscreen game that is what you would do, and the screen\_base\_address would be part of a public api available for that purpose.

Nowadays, on OSX at least, you really have to be a good citizen and not just go drawing over any part of the display - so there are public api's (not just one.. old, new, different level's of abstraction, hardware accelerated, etc.) that make window buffers available. You draw (i.e. manipulate the memory) into these and the OS will composite those into the (private) screen buffer.

If you want to draw images into there, or polygons, or sprites, or text, or video, or voxels, etc. the OS is going to have an API for that, so you don't have to manipulate the window buffer directly, but you can if you want to."

2144,AskProgramming,"Apart from a degree, what programming certifications are worth getting?",None. Employers don't care about them and often look at it like you don't have any experience. Like you are trying to compensate for not having real experience by getting a certificate. Work on some projects and put them on Github. Show them your Github. Study algorithms to prepare for the technical interview. A lot of employers now a days don't even care if you have CS degree so long as you can code and demonstrate you know what you are doing.
2145,AskProgramming,How are tree structures stored (in databases)?,"A naive approach might have comments stored with a PostID and a ParentId where the ParentId is the unique id of the comment above it. Top level comments would have a parentId of 0 or something. Then when you query for comments, you can grab everything belonging to the post Nd then sort comments based on parentIds. Probably not very great performance wise but it is a way to store tree structures comments"
2146,AskProgramming,"What precisely are terminals/consoles and how are they different from each other?

2147,AskProgramming,Why aren't chat apps able to message other chat apps like we do with email?,"It's a business consideration. If you make your chat app work with some common protocol that anyone can use, there's no reason for anyone to use your app, and you can't make money from it. For example, nobody can make any money from email any more because Gmail is free. Nowadays, phone companies can't really make money from texting because too many networks offer unlimited text.

Facebook Messenger is free because they want people to use it (the user is the product), but they want you to create a Facebook account in order to do so. If you could chat with people on Facebook Messenger from some other chat app, then that undermines the business."

2150,AskProgramming,"Why is '_____Factory' a meme when it comes to criticisms of Java, and not other languages?","Because they are extremely prevalent in some Java frameworks, especially more ""Enterprise"" ones. I've never seen Factories being used all over the place in any other language."

2152,AskProgramming,Why studies say there are more jobs than developers but it's very common to see job postings +1 week old with well over 100 applicants?,"its a really hard question that revolves around mismatch of expectations between developers and employers

Developers have skills, but not the skills the employers want. 

Employers need developers but don't know what they want. 

This leads to what looks like a deficit in skilled labor, but really its a deficit in training. 

Its a hard problem, but if both developers and employers can realize this, then it should work is self out in the long run, thats my two cents."
2153,AskProgramming,Is it weird that the amount of frustration and suffering involved with my job drastically decreased when I stop using C ++?,"Python & C# simply don't have many of the foot guns that C++ does. They're newer languages, C++ is carrying backwards compatibility from the 1980s, where's C# only goes back to the 2000s. I don't find it strange that we managed to learn a thing or two about language design in 20 years."
2154,AskProgramming,"If the ""goto"" statement is such a bad thing, why is it even allowed in many programming languages?","Two things here - most such ""truisms"" are basically reasonable opinions with provisos, often parroted to the point that the original context has been lost. Secondly, most modern mainstream languages do not actually have `goto`. C and C++ have due to historical circumstances. Java doesn't, Python doesn't, JavaScript doesn't, Rust doesn't, Haskell doesn't, Swift doesn't, and so on."
2155,AskProgramming,Why do developers create free apps?,"It's fun to make something that's useful, especially when you have full control over the 'how'. It's also very rewarding to see people use the thing you made.

I've worked with a couple of developers that have had huge ego problems. I don't know what it is about this profession, but it does attract some egos.

You shouldn't be *arguing* with your teammates about what strategies/algorithms to implement. You should thoughtfully consider outside opinions about your work without ego. A lot of developers will get unreasonably defensive if their work is criticized and miss out of improvements that could be had."
2163,AskProgramming,Is programming getting oversaturated?,"Well I'll just say this. We wanted a entry level programmer, able to program and understand some database basics. Took 6 months to find a candidate and actually hire them. We were even using a recruiter to assist us."
2164,AskProgramming,Is it possible to measure spaghettiness of code?,"There might be a quite fitting measure... Cyclomatic complexity, it measures the lineary indepent paths in a module.

2171,AskProgramming,"How do I stay passionate about building high-quality software when strategic, company decisions above me can result in all of my effort being discarded at a moment's notice?","I think one of the most important parts of professional software development is understanding and reconciling that you and the company will always have different goals, sometimes contradictory, and understanding how to balance those. You, as an excellent developer, want to write code that is readable, maintainable, extendable, performant, etc, and the business wants to put out a product that is timely, cost-effective, marketable, etc. Balancing that is all about anticipating where corners need to be cut, where the business *might* pivot in the future, when something is *good enough*, etc.


When I first started, all of that was very frustrating and unmotivating as you describe. But as I've gotten to the point I'm at now (10+ years of experience) and come to have a more realistic understanding of what I described above, the business has become an extension of that programming puzzle that makes it so enjoyable for all of us. It's like an ""art from adversity"" kind of thing: given these constraints (some of which are explicit, and some of which you infer from experience), what is the best piece of software you can make. It's almost like reverse gold-plating: not accounting for every possible thing that might ever happen one day, but anticipating the unforeseen curves in the road and not letting yourself commit too far in one direction lest you make it harder to course correct.


So that's a long-winded way of saying: try to make peace with the fact that you and the business will always value slightly different things, and try to see them as a fun obstacle to work around, rather than as an impediment to working how you would in a complete isolation."

2175,AskProgramming,"In a work environment, is it always ok to use libraries?","For questions like this, ASK YOUR BOSS.  It's not a dumb question.  If your boss treats it like one (belittles you for asking or acts put out that he has to answer it), start looking for a new job.  These are the questions that are a million times better to ask up front then find out your assumption was wrong after the fact (and you wasted all of your development time implementing a solution that can't be used).  If your boss is a good boss, they will not mind answering this question up front but will be rightfully annoyed if you assume it's permitted and go forward without asking and the company policy prevents it.

Anyone who says ""yes, it's always okay"" to your question is flat out wrong.  There is no ""industry standard"".  It is entirely dependent on the industry your software is in and company policies.  While yes, most companies would prefer re-using existing code (e.g. libraries) over re-writing everything from scratch, that doesn't mean it's always permitted.  This can be due to industry regulations, security concerns, or even just legal concerns.

For instance, I work on avionics software covered by DO-178C, DAL B.  That means we have strict guidance we have to follow through development, which almost no third party library will meet.  Because of this, we have to basically write our own versions of everything.  We even had to write our own version of the C++ standard library.   We are unable to use third-party libraries even if we wanted to.  If we identify a common functional need that's not part of our homebrew standard library, we have to create our own version of it so we can get it all certified in the end.

There will be other industries where safety or security plays a factor as well.  In some of those cases, you may be able to use third-party libraries, but they may require strict reviews and approvals prior to integrating it with your code base to ensure the library is not introducing any vulnerabilities nor contains any malware.

In the end, the general guideline that it's better to re-use software when possible will pretty much be the case across the board.  However, this does NOT necessarily translate to ""it is always ok to use libraries"".

And this is all ignoring of course the licensing as others have pointed out.  If a license prohibits commercial use, then you won't legally be permitted to use that library within a product you intend to sell or generate revenue with.  There are almost certainly some companies out there that just say no third party libraries so they don't even run the risk of accidentally violating a library license.

So again, ASK YOUR BOSS."
2176,AskProgramming,Why does my CPP professor force us not to use ide but only gedit and the terminal?,"Because it’ll force you to actually learn what you need to do. IDEs hide a multitude of things. What happens when you hit the ‘build’ button? An IDE builds. A command line forces you to figure out what that means. What do all those buttons in the debugging UI actually do? You’ll know if you have to type the commands yourself.

It’s a portable skillset. Your IDE won’t be there when you ssh in to a server. A command line will, and a debugger.

IDEs are force multipliers, and we love them, but it’s worth learning the basics before something goes wrong in prod at 4am and you need to fix it now and don’t have one."
2177,AskProgramming,Who is actually able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack?,"The weak link is typically the routing layer. So either you compromise the router, and re-route packets as you see fit, or you spoof the router and get users to connect to your machine instead."

2179,AskProgramming,what degree of knowledge should I know before applying for a job?,"As far as projects go, I'd reccomend one pretty large and flashy project, supplimented by a sprinkling of smaller projects if you want to show breadth. A large project demonstrates an ability to plan and follow through that you don't really get in sub-thousand line projects. 

If you're just making them for resume purposes, open sourcing them on GitHub is the way to go. If it's mobile dev work you're doing, publishing might be good move, though the likelyhood of a recruiter actually downloading your app is hit or miss. 

As far as ability level goes, the bare minimum is probably language fluency, that is, given a vague description of a solution, you should be able to relatively painlessly translate it into code. Solving hard problems should be the hard part of developing software."

That's probably why you tend to hear these things. There's nothing that makes Java apps inherently slow or clunky, it all comes down to how you build your app. The main complaint against Java itself is that Swing UIs don't have the greatest styling out of the box and they don't fit in with the native styling of any OS... But that's arguably not a big deal these days since we now have many if not most desktop apps built using electron with styling that doesn't match the OS' standards."
2182,AskProgramming,"Why having too many methods in a class is considered bad practice, yet most libraries have classes with dozens, sometimes even hundreds of methods ?","Having many methods in a single class is often a sign that you should divide it up into smaller modules, but that's not always the case. Think of a \`math\` library in most languages, it's likely it will contains dozens of public methods for sin, cos, tan, exponential, etc., plus public constants for pi, e, and so on. It makes sense to put them all together because the only other option would be to divide them up into separate math libraries, perhaps math\_trig and math\_stats and so on.

If it makes sense for them all to be together, then keep them all together."
2183,AskProgramming,I am a UX designer and UI developer but I don't have any idea about databases and hosting stuff. Where do I start?,"So let's work backwards from REST APIs.

When you query an API, you are making an HTTP request to some type of *application server.* The request goes to a *route* ( e.g. /products/{1} ), which in turn will either return some data, perform some action (e.g. insert new data, update existing data), or both, based on the type of HTTP request (GET, POST, etc.).

Typically, when you have an application like a dating site, you will have multiple types of endpoints (another name for routes) for each *entity* you keep track of (e.g. ""User""). They usually boil down to four main ones: Create (insert new data), Read (get existing data), Update (change existing data), and Delete (delete existing data). You'll likely encounter the acronym *CRUD* somewhere - this is what it's referring to.

Again, the logic for these are all defined on an application server. These are written in a high level programming language, typically using a popular *web framework* for the given language (e.g., Python has Flask, Java has Spring, JavaScript has Express.js, etc.). To actually deploy these servers, you have a lot of ""cloud"" options. Heroku is very popular these days for the hobbyist web application developer, but the big cloud providers (Google, Amazon, etc.) also have options as well. You're looking for a Platform as a Service (PaaS) option - all you have to do is write the API application code, and whatever service you choose will handle the underlying infrastructure. See [this example](https://stackabuse.com/deploying-a-flask-application-to-heroku/) for deploying a simple Python web app to Heroku (note, there is no database in that example).

But now you're probably wondering - if the application server exposes the API endpoints that retrieve or manipulate my data, *where is the actual data*? That is where databases come in. The database is a separate piece of the puzzle that the application server connects to via some sort of connection string and interacts with some via sort of database library designed for both the programming language your server is in, as well as the kind of database you're using (sometimes you can even opt for something called an *Object-Relational Mapper*, or ORM, but I won't go into detail on those). So when you make an HTTP GET request to read data about a user, the application server has logic in the /user/{1} endpoint that uses a library to query the database for the needed information, which is then returned as JSON (usually) back to the client that made the API request. This is then what a frontend would consume to display the information.

As for which kind of database to use, there are many, many options. The biggest decision many developers face these days is the SQL vs. NoSQL question, and there are pros and cons to each. The best choice will depend on more specific application requirements and features, but for a dating app the argument could likely be made for both. If you're completely new to databases and data modeling, the traditionalist would recommend you start learning SQL first - it teaches you a lot about how to think about business problems in terms of *entities* and their *relationships*, which is a skill you'd need for either paradigm but in my opinion is more straightforward when you're first learning SQL (others may disagree but eh  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  ). Data modeling can be tricky and there are entire university classes dedicated to the subject, but understanding how to get data into the 3rd normal form in a relational database is a good start (see [this article](https://medium.com/@kimtnguyen/relational-database-schema-design-overview-70e447ff66f9)).

In either case, there are many different flavors of both SQL and NoSQL, but I would recommend PostgreSQL for SQL or MongoDB for NoSQL. There are plenty of other good options, but these two are widely used, capable, and well documented. Whatever PaaS provider you chose for your application server will very likely also offer a database hosting feature as well, but feel free to mix and match as you desire."
2184,AskProgramming,Is it wrong to have a Brainfuck interpreter in my Github which is on my résumé?,"Not at all. I think you might go so far as to censor the name when you refer to it, e.g. Brainf***, just because the actual word might trip some automated resume software, but especially in a professional context your interviewer isn't likely to care given that's the actual name of the language."
2185,AskProgramming,Do some languages have more mature compilers and therefore produce better binaries?,"Potentially, but not necessarily. Some features of the language give it implicitly more speed. For example, Golang has garbage collection which is inherently slower than manual memory handling like what is done in C.

Sometimes this is a double-edged sword, as Go  makes it easier to do complicated things at scale consistently, whereas having a minor memory issue in C is more likely and it could slow down the application."

2188,AskProgramming,How do large sites generate sitemaps?,"44 million rows isn't that much honestly. Generating a gigantic output file from that should take minutes (on cheap consumer hardware) - not days. That's with a naive solution of ""select \* from myTable"" => all in memory now (doesn't everyone have 32+GB of ram? \^\_\^) => buffered write to a file while reusing a string builder to make big chunks.

&#x200B;

Have you tried using a profiler and finding where the bottleneck is?

&#x200B;

For a fancy idea:

\- divide up the data into sitemap files of \~25k rows each. Name it based off a from/to range of the clustered column index and keep the name static & unchanging. Once it's all split up and stuff it'll make updates to your site map go fast & be parallelizable!

\- when a user deletes or adds a row, regenerate the associated file. If the file grows to \~40k rows or more, split it in half, if it shrinks to \~10k combine it with the next file. Querying the table should be fast because its reading from the clustered index w/ a known range.

\- when someone requests the site map, concatenate multiple chunks together until you have at least 50,000 rows.

Just some random musings. It's basically your 2nd idea w/ the key step of ""concatenate/split till you're happy""."

2190,AskProgramming,What is the easiest type of programming to learn while still being easy to get a job/in demand?,"I think If something is technically easy, everyone can do it, and so making a living from it becomes the challenging part. And that means you have to be good at something else in order to give your work value.

WordPress developers probably have the technically easiest development job. Most of them have a template that they use to generate a 4-page site for a business (e.g. Home, About, Products/Services, Contact), which they run once and they’re done. But they also have to know about copy writing, SEO, design, marketing... and they also have to hustle for work _constantly_. 

The programming involved in data analytics is a total piece of piss. But if you don’t have the maths/stats knowledge to understand how to properly manipulate data, you’re gonna have a bad time. Same with visualisation; the maths isn’t as heavy but you’ll need more visual design chops than probably any other field. 

And then, programming difficulty is subjective anyway. I’m a senior web developer, but I still think AAA console games work by magic. At the same time, a typical games developer could no doubt put a web page together, but they’d struggle to build the kind of apps I work on every day. Don’t get me wrong; I could learn games and the games dev could learn the web, but it’s not what we’re good at right now. 

Asking what’s easiest is the wrong approach. Ask what you’re good at, and how you can put those skills to use as a programmer."

2197,AskProgramming,Is Mac necessary?,No. Not even close. The only reason you'd need a Mac is if you're developing for Apple products.
2198,AskProgramming,What did the programmers unlearn in the last 30 years?,"1. Human Interface Guidelines.

I still refer people to 90's era Apple HIG documentation.  The idea of thinking deeply about how humans interact with complicated systems and making coherent internally consistent user interfaces has been utterly abandoned with the rise of web apps.  The browser is 90% of the UI, and web frameworks drift in and out of trendiness.  Being unique and distinctive is considered a selling point.  Designs like magazine pages have displaced the core ideas from the creation of the web when users were expected to set the global style in their browser settings.  Phone UI's need to be 'slick' and 'fluid' with shiny pixel shader animations, but just being able to have widgets that rescale when you change the size of a window is considered exotic.

2. Just write a computer program.

Not everything needs seventeen EC2 instances in each of seven AZ's to host seven variations of JavaScript for various platforms, etc., that takes 5000 a month to sit idle.  C++ is considered a ""hard"" language compared to a hellscape of simultaneously doing html, css, javascript, kubernetes, ruby, yaml, web servers, magic, and baloney.  But in a hell of a lot of cases just writing a computer program to do a thing is way more useful and simpler than creating an abstract meta architecture framework for distributing...  hey what was it supposed to do again?  Fidddling with some bytes in memory in a computer program can be literally billions of times faster than using a scripting language in a container in a VM to request a bit of data that needs to be serialized into JSON, encrypted over TLS, transferred over a network, decrypted, deserialized, converted from text back to an actual number, etc., and then all of that in reverse to get shipped back to some object storage magic because ""files"" are no longer trendy.

3. Finishing a project.  (And programming as a responsibility.)

Seriously, when was the last time you heard of something being finished?!  This was a huge fundamental philosophical shift that the industry never really came to terms with or noticed.  Historically, there was a notion that some people could look at a spec, implement all of the features on the to do list, and then shake hands and move on to other projects.  Now, we have web apps that are continuously being deployed, etc.  So it's just assumed that it will be actively worked on forever and the notion of something being finished and moved to maintenance mode is dead.

The apps on my phone just sort of...  change all the time.  The Google 2FA app was the one I noticed most recently.  The UI changed completely to a new style.  A while back they seemed to be fiddling with Google Fit all the time.  There are teams that are employed to work on these things, so they work on them, and they change them, and they make them bigger.  Adding more whitespace to the UI so it's less information dense and useful has been an ongoing trend.  Generally speaking, none of this actually makes the app unambiguously better.  Back in the day, a text editor would get a spellcheck feature, and it was actually useful and everybody would agree it was better.  But now most apps hit a point where they get their last useful feature, and people keep working on them for years and years because internal corporate sociopolitical structures make it impossible for something to ever get finished.  People get their favorable job reviews every quarter by demonstrating big project accomplishments, utterly regardless of whether they were necessary!

Tied into this, and probably ought to be a separate bullet point, or maybe a whole book unto itself...  Shipping code is seen as a job or a role, maybe an obligation, but not so much a responsibility.  In ye olde days, it was a big deal to test your software adequately to be ready to press a CD with the gold master.  If it was wrong, you'd cost the company a ton of money, etc.  Now, you are Agile and you get something out there that is minimum viable product as fast as possible.  And it's probably a web app so users never even see most of the backend directly so it can all be terrible.  And if you ship a desktop app that doesn't work for shit, you can always have it autodownload an update tomorrow.  Documentation is dead.  Technical writing is destroyed -- the software is changing too fast to write really thorough documentation about.  And people can just google the topics and watch some youtube videos so you don't need to explain the basics to new users.  It's just a job.

4. Visual ""codeless"" programming tools are quite limited.

This gets forgotten every 10-20 years or so.  Humans use language to express complex ideas.  Even deaf people who never hear spoken languages invent sign languages pretty quickly.  If your attempt to make a system for expressing complex processes doesn't work anything like the way that humans engage with complex ideas, you suck and it won't be useful.

That's not to say node graphs are never useful.  But 99.9% of ""We'll make a visual rules engine thing so non technical employees can do that work that it currently done by devs because reasoning suddenly becomes trivial if you don't use any written jargon words"" results in a shitberg of sadness that idiots think was a big success and a bunch of forgotten devs wind up having to hack config files in an underspecified ad hoc syntax to get it to actually do anything.  And eventually it grows in complexity until it is just a terrible interface for making code with the interface layer being just layers of indirection that make things harder rather than easier."

2201,AskProgramming,Why do people push developing any given program as a web application instead of as a desktop application?,"I really do love the performance of stand-alone apps or desktop apps.

2202,AskProgramming,"Developers/Coders, How is the career path of a developer/coder for those not from engineering backgrounds?","I am ""supposed"" to be a music composer or audio artist, I have a Masters degree in Electronic Music, I am 29 years old.

I started using sockets to get musicians play together without the need of a huge mixer (learned about sockets playing videogames, portforwarding and stuff like that you need to play multiplayer games with friends under a NAT). After that I learned Unity and Multiplayer to get a deeper understanding on net codes and how multiplayer stuff works. Then on a side I started doing adaptive and procedural sound designs for videogames as well, highly relaying on code.

I have been living out of programming full-time basically for the last 3 years, trying to solve problems with musicians interacting on a distance. I think I was lucky to win a couple good scholarships but I think the ace in my sleeve up until today was the music and sound knowledge, surely not of my programming skills (even though I am studying and coding like crazy to get to what I think would be a decent level for who I want to be).

Reading this description, maybe I'm more a designer than a programmer but I don't know, I really like making stuff with code and watch it do something, then try to improve it

EDIT: P.s. My advice would be to learn coding anyway. I am pushing on the tech side of what I do now so that if I eventually have kids or anything, I'll already have the skills for working and getting good jobs and maybe finally focus on music instead in the remaining time"
2203,AskProgramming,"What does ""don't code for the sake of coding"" means?","That's not something I hear really often to be honest.

(Side note: I'm not saying there aren't cases for advanced patterns, just that they are not needed everywhere)

I feel that when coding for fun or for learning, we at least partially ""code for the sake of coding"" and it isn't a problem at all.

2210,AskProgramming,What was so fundamentally wrong about Flash and right about Javascript?,"So..initially flash (which is a platform, not a language, like Js) could do things that JavaScript couldn't. Things like playing video and handling vector graphics and web sockets...

However as JavaScript matured those features were added in, JavaScript was made more lightweight and browsers were built to be natively compatible with it out of the box. 

one of the problems with flash is that it is owned and maintained by a single company Adobe. In fact I believe they stopped supporting it this year.

And JavaScript is based off of ecmascript, which is a programming convention that gets updated regularly by a coalition of companies and individuals. they release the standards with the explicit purpose of promoting cross operability between browsers and operating systems.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript

Actually if you read the history it's a wild ride. the fourth convention was canceled because Yahoo, Microsoft, Google and other big players dissented from the group and formed their own convention.

... Anyways that's just some fun trivia.

In short, after the 5th convention, you could do things in JavaScript that you used to only be able to do in flash, and now it takes only 10% of the memory and is much faster.

JavaScript code runs natively within web browsers and is designed to be light on its feet and super-fast. By comparison, Flash is cumbersome, consumes a huge amount of system resources and has a very real impact on mobile device battery life.

Mobile is fast becoming the computing platform of choice and that means software efficiency has never been more important. Flash is an old technology that simply struggles to make the most of new hardware and coding practices.

You only have to send raw text/code instead of a big compiled flash file.

when you build a website you host your image on a CDN somewhere and then put the link in your website... With flash you can't just store the link you have to store the whole asset,and that makes files bigger the more images and assets you have.

In addition to that there are inherently security concerns when you trust a file from the internet to run on your machine.

With JavaScript it's more or less locked down to the browser only, but the flash player has direct OS access and is well documented to have many bugs that allow people to get password protected data through the flash player on a person's machine.

Flash has a rather unenviable history of bugs, malware and security flaws that have made it a target for nefarious developers and hackers.


Nasty code can be relatively easily injected into Flash applications in order to spread viruses that conduct attacks such as denial-of-service and cross-site scripting.


 Apple’s iOS platform doesn’t support Flash. Think about the many millions of iPhone and iPads in use; if you create a web app in Flash, you’re cutting yourself off from a huge section of the market.

Similarly, Flash isn’t supported on Android, adding yet millions more to the number of users who will be unable to access your hard work.

Google moved all of YouTube's videos from flash to HTML5 in 2015.

Search engines also can't use text from a flash file very easily for searches. That's because of the nature of the flash file

 it is just compiled bytecode nonsense.

 Search engines such as Google may be able to index the text from Flash files, but they’re not particularly keen on doing so. This is largely due to the fact that they’re far more concerned about a website’s ability to be displayed correctly on as many devices as possible.

Google has even taken it upon themselves to warn its users if websites listed within search results are unlikely to work on their device. Would you want your website or web app to have that label applied to it?"
2211,AskProgramming,What are the practical programming implications of Apple switching to ARM for Macs?,">1) I know that Debian and Arch can be run on ARM, does that mean all the *nix utilities and apps can be brought over to the new Macs with just a recompile?

More than likely, keep in mind that sometimes applications are written with the processor targets in mind. That being said, Raspberry PIs have ARM cortex chips and plenty of stuff is already set up to run on raspberry pis. Most of the unix utilities are available already as well within Raspian.

>2) If developers are using Apple frameworks, Xcode, and developing the way Apple suggests it will be pretty easy to bring their apps over to the new system right?

Likely yes, Apple would be stupid not to make sure their entire ecosystem works on ARM processors before releasing an ARM mac.

>3) How difficult will it be for x86 cross platform programs to be ported over?

It depends, it varies from 30 seconds and some testing to hundreds of hours and probably hundreds of thousands of dollars.

>4) I assume that really big software packages like the Adobe suite etc. can have more issues. Are the issues ones that can be solved by throwing resources at them or will they require total rewrites?

They probably don't require full rewrites, but there's probably been hundreds of thousands of testing hours across users, internal testing, etc. Running on an entirely new platform that is untested requires a lot of testing to be confident for a release.

Most deployment servers are also still likely x86, so instead of something you build on your mac being tested on a remote server, you now are building something locally on ARM, and rebuilding it on x86 unless you spring for ARM deployment servers. This is just another complication to account for."
2212,AskProgramming,Is there any realistic way of me learning COBOL and getting a COBOL job?,"If you've got the time and energy to learn such languages as assembly and C, I'm sure you can learn something like COBOL. As others have asked, why you want this pain in your life?"
2213,AskProgramming,Why does everybody make fun of js?,"Brendan Eich's original vision was to embed Scheme (a dialect of Lisp) into NetScape, but that was stopped by executive meddling. What the internet got instead was a chimera of a language with Java syntax and *some* of the functional elements of Scheme, and a compromising mess of a type system. Modern JS development tools and practices are also partly to blame for its reputation. npm's many fiascos come to mind. Lastly, the fact that the JS community is an increasingly fragmented mess of flavor-of-the-month frameworks isn't helping. 

To be frank, from ES6 onward, the language actually isn't that bad. The more I use it the more I think the hate is blown out of proportion, but that's just me."
2214,AskProgramming,What are some good resources to learn Software Design and Architecture?,"as a beginner you're stuck in a position where you want to learn how to do things, but also how to write them. i.e you don't only want to paint a painting, but you also want it to be pretty and admired.

for programming there's a lot of schools of thought on this subject, some guys prefer test-driven development, others domain-driven design.

some think comments outside of method parameters are good coding praxis, others think it's a code-smell because if you have to explain your code you probably wrote it in a way that makes it difficult to understand.

some think patterns are for hipsters, others are of the correct opinion (ahem) that they are standardised solutions for common problems.

all in all, if I could go back in time 15 years when I started programming, I would read the following if they were available at the time:

[https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215)

Domain-Driven Design is the concept of breaking your code into logical real world units and bundling your code around these objects so that it makes sense to program if you understand the real world your program is mirroring. i.e if you're making a fruit shop program, you might have a fruit seller, a register, a fruit warehouse, a process to deal with ordering fruit etc.

[https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)

Clean code talks not so much about the architectural patterns (outside of test-driven development) but rather what's good and bad about code at it's core. i.e

    if(fruitStand.Amount < 5)
    {
        fruitHelper(fruitStand, 3434)
    }
    
    vs
    
    if(fruitStand.Amount < dailySoldAverage)
    {
        OrderNewFruit(fruitStand, wholesaleDiscountCode)
    }

outside of that, I think you'll find a lot more resources by simply researching the concepts these guys talk about. programming is constantly changing, as long as you have the fundamentals in place as these guys talk about you're golden as long as you're willing to learn."
2215,AskProgramming,"What does it mean to be ""Turing Complete"" in really simple words?","The Turing Test and Turing Completeness are completely unrelated concepts, they're just both named after Alan Turing.

Turing Completeness is used to describe what kind of calculations a machine is able to do, and the set of problems that machine is able to solve. Most general purpose computers are considered Turing Complete: if you pretend they have infinite memory and infinite storage space, all these computers can do the same set of tasks. (Although you might need to reprogram them or write separate software for each one.)

You can compare this to a machine designed to do a very specific task, like an old pocket calculator or alarm clock. They have chips that are made to do specific things and can't be made to do something else. These aren't Turing Complete.

This is a bit of an oversimplification, of course. But it gets the idea across."

2217,AskProgramming,What exactly is C#?,"Dotnet Core is open source under the MIT License and is Cross Platform.

https://github.com/dotnet/core

Mono predates Dotnet Core and is an alternative cross platform implementation. I believe it is still used in some places, such as for Web Assembly support.

Dotnet Framework was not cross platform, and while still supported, is essentially discontinued.

The way C# works is very close to the way Java works. You compile to a universal format, which is then executed by the Common Language Runtime (or the Java Virtual Machine). However, the main difference is C# applications will package the CLR in the deployment, vs requiring the user to install the JVM.

You can, of course, do things differently. Dotnet has an experimental AOT compiler implementation.

2219,AskProgramming,"As a web developer, what should I remove from my computer when giving it back to the company I leave?","I dont tend to do much personal stuff on my work laptop. Most of it is done via login through Google if any. So I usually just wipe the internet files. I even go manually cleanup the temp folders. About it. They'll probably wipe in anyways. If you want you can probably wipe it yourself (if you're worried about malicious behavior). However, that action may be met with varied reactions.

2220,AskProgramming,What is a good resource to learn assembly?,"I'd start with a simpler architecture than x86/x86-64.  The vast majority of tooling you'll find for x86-64 is geared towards use in production and not learning.

What you really want is an integrated environment that makes it easier to debug your code.  I like this [course for learning MIPS](https://chortle.ccsu.edu/assemblytutorial/).  The simulator they use makes it simple to step through the code one line at a time and watch the register values change.  That's absolutely crucial for understanding what the hardware is doing."

2222,AskProgramming,How do group video calls work?,"They always use a central server. Audio and video data takes a lot of bandwidth and it's never feasible to upload it more than once at a time. In a technical sense today there's not much difference to Twitch streaming and such, however the main effort goes into compression & encoding tricks and hacks to reduce latency to everyone in the call. 

Before discord, gaming communities had to install their own Mumble or TeamSpeak (and such) servers for easy voice chat. They had separate server software and separate client software that was required to support the specific protocol that particular VoIP variant used, and each variant actually sounded different because they all compressed and encoded the data in a distinct way.

In ye olden days Skype used peer-to-peer, at least to some extent, where all clients in the call spread the data packets around, helping or skipping the server. It's not open source so can't verify, but I don't think they do this anymore, at least in the classical sense. P2P is unreliable and very susceptible to network issues but back then saving server stress was worth it."
2223,AskProgramming,Is Rust actually worthwhile to seriously learn?,"Define worthwhile. What is your goal after maybe having learned Rust?

I did, and learning it in itself was valuable to me because I got some inspiration as to how to design public interfaces of modules and what to look out for to prevent shared mutable state etc. in systems that have been built with other languages (not originally by me, I have never worked on a greenfield, I maintain legacy software).

You can't really expect a language that's around for a few years to be magically used for everything. Hell, there are 40 years old mainframes running on Batch and Cobol and stuff like that."
2224,AskProgramming,"Why does it seem like many drawing-coordinate systems start with 0,0 in the upper left hand corner, rather than what we traditionally learn in grade school with 0,0 being at the bottom left?","The short answer: The electron gun started in the top left of the CRT screen.

The longer answer: Therefore, upper left became pixel zero.  It proceeded across the screen from left to right, then followed a blackened scan-line, back to the left, to begin the next scan-line.  Thus the memory layout was left to right, top to bottom.

OpenGL uses Y=0 X=0 as bottom left in most of its fixed function pipeline matrix setup helper functions.

TL;DR: We write top to bottom and left to right, therefore screens were made to do the same, even if it could have been a different layout."

2227,AskProgramming,What level of tracking is typical on work laptops?,"IT person here - at the company I currently work at, we don't have any specific tracking software installed on workstation computers. I could probably track down what websites people are using just from network logs, but (and this is what I'm assuming would be the case even for a company that installs tracking software) I don't have the time or the desire to look into that.

You could try looking at what programs are installed on your machine and search online for any that you don't recognize. Likely, if they are using tracking software (and aren't military/security as you said), it won't be homegrown so there will be online sources to give you an idea of what they can track.

There's a chance they could be using some form of agentless tracker (agentless just means the program runs on a central source, without needing to install software on the target machine), but I don't think they'd be able to get much information in an agentless architecture. Either way, if you don't find any tracking programs but you still think there might be tracking involved - open the local firewall rules to see what ports are open. That will be a lot more involved, and you might not find anything interesting. But if it is an agentless architecture, they'd have to open up a port through the local machine's firewall.

All this is a lot of work when you could probably just ask if and what the company is tracking."

2231,AskProgramming,What to do if technical debt is so big that an application becomes impossible to maintain?,"Look into [strangler pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html). Basically the idea is that you develop new features/services that are properly isolated, identify points of insertion in your legacy code base, and, once it's established that you're not breaking anything, cut over to them fully and deprecate/remove the old code. This is a low(er)-risk way of chipping away at the legacy codebase while also delivering on new features.

If you haven't already, introduce tools like code quality analysis and static code analysis, so you can start measuring code quality and issues, and making sure you at least aren't making things worse with your new changes. It can also help guide your refactoring efforts to tame at least certain parts of your legacy code.

edit: a word"
2232,AskProgramming,What is the ELI5 for how RegExp works?,"First, that gibberish-looking `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*\s*=\s*\d+\s*;` syntax is just some notation. The regex engine reads this notation and builds its internal representation - a _state machine_.

A state machine is basically a directed graph whose nodes represent questions about the next symbol in the input stream and the edges are the possible answers to these questions _and_ instructions to go to the next question.

For example:
 1. Is the current symbol one of `a-zA-Z_`? If yes, read next character and go to state 2, else _NO MATCH_;
2. Is the current symbol one of `a-zA-Z_0-9`? If yes, read next character and go to state 2, else read next character and go to state 3;
3. Is the current symbol a kind of space (the syntax is `\s`)? If yes, read next character and go to state 3, else read next character and go to state 4;
4. Is the current symbol a literal ""equals"" sign (`=`)? If yes, read next character and go to state 5, else _NO MATCH_;
5. Is the current symbol a kind of space (the syntax is `\s`)? If yes, read next character and go to state 5, else read next character and go to state 6;
6. Is the current symbol a digit? If yes, read next character and go to state 7, else _NO MATCH_;
7. Is the current symbol a digit? If yes, read next character and go to state 7, else read next character and go to state 8;
8. Is the current symbol a kind of space (the syntax is `\s`)? If yes, read next character and go to state 8, else read next character and go to state 9;
9. Is the current symbol a literal semicolon? If yes, __FOUND A MATCH__! Else, _NO MATCH_!

Say, your string is `""abc = 82;""`. You read the first character and go to state `(1)`.

If you arrive at state `(9)` and get a match, this means that, well, the regular expression above matches the string, or, in other words, that string can be generated by the grammar encoded by the regular expression.

If you arrive at `NO MATCH` _anywhere during the execution of the algorithm_ (not necessarily in state `(9)`), you stop and report an error because the regex doesn't match the string.

As you can see, this can be easily implemented with `goto` statements and labels:

```
azAZ_ = ""abcd...xyzABCD...XYZ_"";
azAZ_09 = azAZ_ + ""0123456789"";

START:
 ch = getchar();
 if (ch in azAZ_) goto _2;
 goto ERROR;

_2:
 ch = getchar();
 if (ch in azAZ_09) goto _2;
 goto _3;

_3:
 ch = getchar();
 if (isspace(ch)) goto _3;
 goto _4;

_4:
 ch = getchar();
 if (ch == '=') goto _5;
 goto ERROR;

// and so on...

_9:
 ch = getchar();
 if (ch == ';') goto MATCH;
 goto ERROR;

ERROR:
 printf(""ERROR at character '%c'!\n"", ch);
MATCH:
 puts(""Yeah, everything is OK!"");
```

Now, you wouldn't normally generate that code from the regex string above (although you could). Instead, you'd build some kind of graph (like a linked list, but a graph whose node can link to _any_ other node, including itself), whose nodes will execute some functions that can return, for example, a pointer to the node where the algorithm will jump:

```
node *start; // will be filled up by analyzing the regex string

node *current_node = start;
while (1) {
 current_node = current_node.step(string_to_match);
 
 if (current_node.tag == NODE_ERROR) {
  printf(""ERROR at character '%c'\n"", current_node.character);
  break;
 } else if (current_node.tag == MATCH) {
  puts(""Yeah boiiiiiiiiii!"");
  break;
 }
}
```"

2235,AskProgramming,Am I wrong???,"In cases like this, it can be useful to both provide the answer that you suspect the professor is looking for and also indicate why that answer might not be correct. You're hedging your bets. If it's meant to be a straightforward question, you provide a straightforward answer. If it's meant to be a trick question, you point out the trick."
2236,AskProgramming,Why write unit tests?,"Unit tests let you test a portion of your application without actually having to build and run the whole thing. Having to build your application, run it, trigger the right code path (by visiting a page/menu or pressing some buttons or whatever), and then testing your feature can take quite some time.  
  
Let's say you've written an algorithm whose job is to find and process some data in a folder, but to activate the feature you first have to navigate through a dozen menus and press a button. That takes time, and if you end up having to make a lot of small changes to the algorithm to get it working, that'll get old real fast.  
  
Now if you create unit tests for your algorithm, you can immediately run it by just starting the test through your IDE. If you write your tests properly, you can easily test your algorithm under all sorts of different circumstances and with all kinds of different inputs within seconds (or at least faster than you could do so otherwise).  
  
Unit tests can also be automated using tool like [Codium.ai](https://Codium.ai)  Lets say you've finished your algorithm and it works great for months, but eventually it turns out that a minor change somewhere else in your application caused the algorithm to behave slightly differently but still doesn't an exception. Without unit tests, you wouldn't know about this change until a user starts complaining that the algorithm's results are wrong. With unit tests, you can be alerted the moment the change happens (because if you wrote your tests correctly, they'll start failing) and you can fix it when it happens. The issue wouldn't have even left your development environment."

If this guy has that much trouble, be prepared for lots of emails and calls that ""will only take a minute"" to answer a simple question. I had an old job of mine do that - they had a new guy come in after I left (since they didn't pay me enough, I asked for a raise with evidence of why I deserved it before I told them I took another offer) and they started trying to reach me.

I left documentation, architecture diagrams, everything you SHOULD need. They hired a guy that was immensely underqualified for the job. I told them that my rate was $175/hour for consultation, minimum billable time 1 hour, and I never heard from them again.

Edit: To answer your question on the exit interview, don't burn any bridges. It's a small industry, and I've run into the same people multiple times. If you're being let go, it's very unlikely that your exit interview will change their minds about it. If he's as incompetent as you say, there's a reasonable chance you'll be called in for a new contract (or full time position) in a few months or so."

2251,AskProgramming,Using POST instead of GET for more secure information retrieval?,"> I know that typically POST is used for creating, but is there anything wrong with the way we are doing it?

No, it's pretty common to do this with data that you don't want to have end up in access logs. You can also of course just disable the logging of information in the path of GET request. That's another option.

But doing it in a POST is not 'wrong' at all. POST is used for search a lot anyway."
2252,AskProgramming,"When java appeared, did it suffer any resistance to be used?",Oh sure. There were loads of people who felt Perl was a better language :) There are always people who resist change. It's human nature. But it's also not bad at all to be skeptical of hypes. All software goes through a [hype cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle).
2253,AskProgramming,"In languages that need "";"" at the end of lines, what does "";"" really do?",">hey bro the code of this line ends here

That's not a good description. Most languages that use semi-colons (every one that I know) don't care about *lines*. This is valid Java code

    public static void main(String[] args) { foo();bar(); }

Semi-colons delimit statements. Nothing more, nothing less.

In some languages there are ambiguities when semi-colons are not used. Consider this JavaScript example

    foo() 
    (1+2).toString()

To a human it may look obvious what the intent is here (call foo, then call toString() on the number 3) but to a parser it's less obvious. It could be (and in JavaScript *is*) interpreted like

    foo()(1+2).toString()

i.e.

1. call foo()
2. get a *function* that foo returned
3. invoke that function with the argument 3
4. call toString on the result.

This interpretation is likely to cause issues. In our code (as written to 2 lines), it looks overwhelmingly like foo() probably does not return a function, so trying to invoke it would throw an exception.

The only way to solve this issue in JavaScript is to add the semi-colon on end of the first line.

Languages which enforce semi-colons do so at least partially at avoid ambiguities like this."
2254,AskProgramming,should I learn python then C++?,"Hmmm, I'm struggling to come up with a good analogy but here's the truth.

Python (as designed) hides away some of the tougher aspects of programming behind lots of convenient code. This helps people code faster, but it also means you don't understand what's happening as well.

So when you learn Python, you think coding works a certain way, but C++ requires you to understand a lot deeper. 

Going from easy to hard is hard, where C is much harder than Python. 

If you learn C++ first, then C++ becomes your ""easy"" eventually, and Python is super easy relative to C++.

Hopefully that makes sense!"

2256,AskProgramming,People say that programming is all about problem solving and working through something to find a solution. How do I know if **I'm** a problem solver and would be good at programming?,"Critical thinking is a skill like any other. Problem solving is a skill like any other. These are skills you can learn and develop over time. First, you need to learn the tools (programming language, algorithms, etc.). Then to need to learn how to apply the tools (libraries, design patterns, dev ops, source control, etc.). Then you need to learn where and why to apply the tools (designing solutions for business problems). The problem is, most people want to do the first part and stop. Because the other things you must learn are not as straightforward. They're also things that are very difficult to learn outside of a team with mentoring. It's actually relatively easy to learn to write code. Myriad programmers go on about how anyone can code, but they fail to impart that the true difficulty in their craft is design, not implementation.

The issue is, there are a lot of analogies about programming tools being like hammers and screwdrivers and the like. And those are fine for illustrating a certain point. But the reality is, you can model machines of infinite complexity using these tools. Where do you even start?

If you have an interest in programming, that's enough to get started. Learn to code. Do Code Academy. Do Coding Game or whatever it's called. Then follow tutorials on creating games or websites or apps or whatever you want to make. Don't be silly and do your own thing, actually learn what they're teaching. Then join a team, find people who know more than you. Read open source stuff, consider contributing. Read the problems they're trying to solve, and look at how other people are solving them.

These are skills and they only get better with practice, and you're never going to feel ready. I've been programming as my career for almost 7 years and I still don't feel ready half the time."

The only thing holding me back is whether it could be a development machine without many headaches."
2268,AskProgramming,How does a computer know how to interpret binary?,"It does not. 

At the hardware level, the computer has no idea if a series of bits form an ASCII character, a UTF character, a number, a pixel, a signal level, an instruction code or any other type of data. They're just binary digits that the CPU manipulates as it executes instructions.

The program code (""software"") running on the computer gives meaning to those bits from the user perspective, as defined by the programmer. The computer has various components for graphics, sound etc. that can interpret bits appropriately, but the software is 100% responsible for which bits go where.

If there is an error in the program that makes the CPU try to execute, say, image data as instruction codes, it will merrily try to do so. If the image was specially crafted to actually contain a valid set of instructions, the CPU could even succeed rather than just perform nonsensical operations until an error occurs."
2269,AskProgramming,Is it okay to use somebody else's Bootstrap template for my Software Engineer portfolio?,"It depends what kind of position you're applying for, really.

If I'm hiring a junior dev, then part of their job will almost certainly be modifying larger frameworks and code-bases (whether written in-house or not), so something like this in your portfolio is probably not going to hurt you as long as you're up-front about what it is and why it's there. The ability to make decent changes to other people's code is most definitely a skill that employers look for.

If, however, you're applying for a senior position, I'd expect to see more in the way of your own, original code; minor tweaks to existing code will not set you apart unless you're solving difficult bugs / problems, creating new features or providing support for different languages / other frameworks etc.

Don't forget: employers don't like spending more time than necessary on any task. The ability to integrate 3rd party frameworks and libraries is so fundamental to basically any major development project that it's unlikely to hurt your prospects *as long as you're honest* about it. Don't pass off work as your own, credit original authors, and make sure you document your modifications."

2275,AskProgramming,Why is 32 bit called x86 while 64 bit called x64?,"> Why is 32 bit called x86

Strictly speaking it is not. A specific 32 bit instruction set is called x86: the one introduced by the Intel x86 processor line (80186 to 80486 after which intel changed their naming schemes). There are other 32 bit instruction sets around as well, like former ARM generations (todays ARM iirc is also 64bit)

> while 64 bit called x64

because it is actually called x86-64. The 64 bit extension of the x86 instruction set. But writing x86-64 all the time sucks so it was shortened to x64.

PS: because someone just posted a comment that ""amd64 is the more proper name"" and I already typed out my response when they deleted it again I'll just add my reply here ...

> I think x86-64 is the better name though. It makes it clear that we are talking about an extension to x86 in contrast to ""amd64"" which would suggest a completely separate architecture.

2276,AskProgramming,"I am no programmer by any means, but I was simply wondering: with todays knowledge of optimizing graphics how well could someone make a Playstation 1 game look even with its same hardware? Would there be any improvements on optimizing graphics if someone tried to develop on a PS1 right now?","On the same hardware? Unlikely. Early consoles had to do a lot with very little, so their optimization was usually already _ridiculous_. [And I mean ridiculous](https://www.quora.com/How-did-game-developers-pack-entire-games-into-so-little-memory-twenty-five-years-ago/answer/Dave-Baggett?srid=z9ZA&share=1). The fancy graphics of modern games are not mainly due to better optimization. Instead, they are due to a few factors:

**(1) Smaller, faster, more power efficient circuitry.** This is fairly self-explanatory: when you have more power/space available, you can do more stuff. This applies to CPUs, graphics cards, base chipsets... anything, really.

**(2) New software ""tricks"", plus the hardware/firmware to back them.** Certain specific use cases are implemented in special hardware/drivers. One example is Nvidia PhysX, which is a driver feature that enables using circuits built for graphics calculations for physics instead. That means that physics effects can be rendered for [many more objects](https://youtu.be/EWFkDrKvBRU?t=52) at the same time.

This sort of tactic can't be ""back-ported"" to a PS1 since it lacks both the hardware and the drivers. Hell, PhysX can't even be ""ported"" to AMD graphics cards. _grumble grumble_


**(3) Ironically, _unoptimization_.** Consider a scene where a character is looking out on a landscape from a balcony. The ""optimized"" way to do it is to create a detailed but static 2D skybox. At best, maybe give it a repeated animation. That means that all the work to draw the image, calculate shadows/movement, etc can be done only once; players' systems then only have to draw the pre-rendered image. 

Modern games could do that too, and even at higher resolutions, that would look better and be _blazing fast_. However, since the hardware exists to do something fancier while still being fast enough the eye can't notice the difference, why not render an entire [custom scene](http://i.imgur.com/MirqTir.jpg), featuring physically simulated rivers and wind, a ""time-of-day"" dependent light source, and long render distances so you can see a deer run across a hill a mile away?

When developers, game designers, and artists don't have to spend their time optimizing stuff bit by bit and byte by byte, that leaves more time and manpower to make cooler stuff. Could more of the recent stuff be manually bit-optimized the way PS1 (and earlier) games were? Sure, but it would take *years* to do. By that point the next graphics card would be released and the optimization will have been a waste of time. The benefits of optimization aren't forgotten though: there are a ton of computer scientists working on teaching computers how to [automatically optimize this stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimizing_compiler), to get the best of both worlds -- developers who can code with abandon, and code that is snappier than it has any business being.

---

That said, there are _some_ optimization tricks that have evolved over the years. Off the top of my head, a good example is [tesselation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation_\(computer_graphics\)), where an object can gain/lose 3D detail based on distance from the camera (so a complex object can be simplified at distances where you can't tell the difference). However, like many other such optimizations, it can't quite be ported back to a PS1 because:

1. A PS1 can't render things that are complex enough in the first place to even benefit from it.

2. The ""buy-in"" requirement to even run these advanced algorithms is tens, if not hundreds of MB of RAM (preferably, video RAM). A PS1 has 2 MB. That isn't even enough to run the most basic ""[hello world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)"" program in many current-day languages.

---

**tl;dr**: It's very hard to say. Current-day graphics are more inefficient than ever because we have more powerful hardware than ever, and whatever optimizations they use are beyond something a PS1 can handle at all.

It's kind of akin to asking ""how much more could Shakespeare write today, with the workflow streamlining abilities of computers?"" Probably less, actually, since he'd be distracted by cat gifs or video games. ;)"

If you want to be hired in a year, make a hard commitment. For example, maybe spend 8 hours studying and programming each day or whatever amount of time you have.

You have to write a lot of code. When John purcell tells you to play aroud with the code, test changes and make it break and fix it, DO IT. Don't just sit there and imagined you learned stuff.

Programming is a craft so just like a carpenter, only reading and watching will not make you a programmer. You must practice a lot and make things or you will end up feeling like you know nothing after a year.

If you have no ideas at all, check out sites like https://www.codewars.com/ to get some tasks to try to solve.

Make a github account and put your code there. Partially it will teach you version systems. You will also see your progress and perhaps have some projects you can show an employer.

2283,AskProgramming,Advice to become a faster (& more robust) developer?,"I'll give you some advice without actually knowing what you mean by ""faster"", since you might not actually be as slow as you think, as long as the quality of your output is good.

I think in general, the one thing to really focus on is the size of your PRs. In most cases when people are early in their careers the PRs they write are very long and much more complex than they need to be. You have to write an endpoint that validates the input, writes to the database and paginates the results returned? Great. That's at least 3 separate PRs, 1 for the endpoint and input validation + tests, 1 for the DB writes + tests and finally 1 for pagination + integration tests, even though it might seem like 1 is sufficient.

Doing this will do wonders for your speed and I would argue quality. Unless you \_really\_ need to make that in a single PR always split it into separate smaller ones. This will do a few things:

\- Make it much more manageable for you to think about the problem

\- Make it much easier for others to review your code

\- Make it much more likely that there won't be thousands of comments to address in your code since there's not much code to begin with.

I'm sure that a part of you thinking that you're being slow isn't just that you take a long time to solve a problem, but also might be that it takes you a long time to write a solution, then refactor it to make it presentable, then write all the tests, then address the comments etc. I think most of those problems can be solved by following the advice above."
2284,AskProgramming,How does single server with single app deployed handle multiple requests?,"What you gotta realize that yes while the server is going to be doing a lot, it is not going to be doing everything needed for that webpage. You can think of a server coming under the broad category of two things, querying and searching for some stuff in a database and serving you the results, or the server being used as a control server for something else like a dashboard. In terms of web apps almost 90% of the websites needs only these functions. It is different if say you are doing some actual processing on the cloud in which case you'd mostly be assigned a flexible compute unit based on your needs.

Now you need to see that per request generally the server needs to only respond a couple times and it's done, the remaining processing is don't at client side. So unless you are streaming music or movies the server is needed only when making a request. TCP is the actual communication protocol in the transport layer over which this happens (it's not the only one tho). And what used to happen before, each new request would be given a new process, today we may prefer to use threads. While the core would actually do only one thing at a time, the time needed to do that one thing however is VERY small. Can you run Windows or Linux on a single core machine??? Yes! But how are you being able to run multiple apps on a single core?? It's just that like someone else said, the core keeps switching between the different processes, but it is so fast that to a human it would look as if things are happening at the same time. And the thing is today's computers are FAST. A server CPU would have a butt load of cores. And each core is perfectly capable of handling multiple thousands of requests.

Now if you are thinking about how companies like Google and Netflix Do this then it's basically due to money. They can afford to have multiple servers that stores the same info, have a lot of load balancers, and a lot of optimization wrt network infrastructure to be able to do this.

Here is a video that may help from Gary explains: https://youtu.be/Tn0u-IIBmtc

Have you timed it?  It is entirely reasonable that a dozen-line script is taking 50 ms if a few of those lines have to go out to a hardware device and do some serial communication.  In general when chasing down timing problems if you haven't measured it then it's a bad idea to guess how long something takes.

As another commenter suggested, cron is probably the right solution here.  It allows you to schedule the task with some period *and* if the task crashes in one iteration then that won't stop the next iteration from running.  That can make it a more robust solution.

The other option is to shift from the ""sleep for"" paradigm to the ""sleep until"" paradigm.  The simplest way of doing this is to note the time at the start, then each loop increment that time by one period (e.g. one minute in your case).  At the end of each loop calculate the remaining time until when the next period should start and sleep for that duration.  I'm not that familiar with python, but it would appear that importing `pause` and `datetime` allows something to the effect of:

    time = datetime.now()
    delta = datetime.timedelta(1, 0)
    while True:

If you're really feeling motivated add a tailored sentence or 2 in a cover letter that explains why you're good for THAT position.

But you don't want to be annoying. Whoever is reviewing resumes will likely pick up on that. And if you're spamming the reviewer will say to themselves ""man, this person is annoying"" and will ignore anything with your name on it. Reviewers are people, often told by their boss to review hundreds of resumes. They're looking for the right experience with respectable presentation and a polite interaction to determine if they want that person to be around in their organization every day for years.

You can also write the SW to run within a programming environment on the phone. For example Pythonista you can write apps in and use all the features on the phone, it’s just not as clean as a native app, but it’s pretty flexible if you need access to the camera etc. 

But an easier solution would be a web based solution. As long as your not using any features like the camera on the phone. You can host the website internally from a laptop since you probably only need access while at work. No need for a hosting company. If you need access outside of work set up a vpn on the laptop."

2337,AskProgramming,"I remember times when we all eagerly played Flash games, my PC at those times (mid-end) did not start coolers or eat too much RAM for those games and websites. Now any light html5 canvas rendering seems to send my PC to space mission, due to the sound of the coolers. What has changed?","WebGL happened. You can actually get at the graphics card through a standard web api now, hence games can be a lot more graphics intensive. There's also a lot of game engines for the web now (Unity for example) that makes it easier for developers to make games, especially if it's just Joe Shmoe in his free time. The downside is you get a lot of extra things that the specific game in question may not need, leading to extra computations eating up your computer.

Some combination of those things, along with websites, in general, being more heavyweight now will add to those problems."

Im assuming TLS in this case does not mean transport layer security but, an acronym for something else or they have some specific interpretation for this use case that isn’t what you think it is without context.

Or it depends on the programming language and the way incrementing is implemented low-level?,"It does depend, but in a sensible language it shouldn't, most languages it won't, certainly not any mainstream C compiler. 

That said, addition is extremely cheap and is very rarely going to be the bottleneck in your application. 

""Premature optimization is the root of all evil"" - Donald Knuth

It's much more important to write working code, and then second to write modular code. Once you've done that, if you notice your application not being fast enough, then you can make it faster. 

There are some exceptions, but these are generally ""best practices"". So for example if you have an enormous list of things and you want to check if something is in that list, that list had better be a hash table (dict/vector etc.). Anyway--computers are fast, don't worry about small stuff like that for now."
2344,AskProgramming,how common is it for programmers to be able to work remotely with flexible hours in a low pressure environment?,"I'd say its pretty frequent. Happens to me and I work in a bank.

2345,AskProgramming,What is the future of Stack Overflow?,"I could write about this at length but, in short, I believe Stack Overflow grew too quickly.

The whole model just doesn't really scale, and they seem unwilling to make any drastic changes.

Nowadays the question quality is terrible, and most new users are not interested in answering other people's questions. It's a negative feedback loop where established users leave because they're sick of the lack of quality, and the quality drops further.

I don't believe the company know how to address the problems. They are putting a lot of effort developing their enterprise product, which seems pretty useless. Our company would never use it. What they don't seem to grasp is that Stack Overflow's most valuable (and practically only) asset is the community. The software is average and could be easily copied. They don't own any of the content. 

The website will continue to be a valuable resource that you find through Google but I'd say there is very little reason for anyone to participate any more. 

I predict that it will gradually die and be replaced with something else. An unscrupulous competitor could rip all the good content and skim off the crap, since the content is all licensed under creative commons."
2346,AskProgramming,How do I start up with GPU programming?,"I recommend looking into [OpenCL](https://opencl.org/). There's a neat [Python wrapper](https://documen.tician.de/pyopencl/) that saves you from much of the C drudgery to build and link stuff to make it run on your GPU. The only C you need to write is whatever actually runs in a distributed manner.

I found it easy to use for giving myself a primer. It even supports running single-thread or just on the CPU, for debugging purposes or if your GPU is incompatible.

Good luck!"
2347,AskProgramming,How does one start to learn programming?,"Personally I think one tip is to have some kind of goal. Do you have some interests in mind? Do you have a hobby? Do you have a child?

2348,AskProgramming,What are Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ?,"Basically, they're servers that handle all the details of sending messages between other services. In a simple Server A talks to Server B scenario, it would probably suffice to use a simple TCP connection. But what if I've got 5 Servers, A-E, that all want to be alerted to an event produced by Server F? Or I've got a bunch of servers that all do the same thing, for distributing computationally intensive tasks? What about if I need a queue, so that when Server B is working on some long running task, it can have a backlog of events to handle once it's done? Etc, etc.

Basically, they handle the details around message passing."
2349,AskProgramming,What is the difference between VM based languages and those without VM?,"Not much from the user perspective. Its possible that a VM language is more similar to a native language over another VM language.

2352,AskProgramming,any learning material on the logic of OOP?,"> I do study logic

If you mean mathematics, involving predicates and truth tables, deduction and proofs, etc. then I think you will not find quite that sort of formal description of object-oriented programming.

OOP is a little bit more subjective and philosophical, with varoius principles and guidelines. It is not a rigorous topic, generally speaking. For a period of time it was mostly a buzzword, even.

The term has been used, re-used, and abused quite a lot over the years, by different people.
Alan Kay invented the term in the 60s, and said of C++: ""I invented the term Object-Oriented, and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind.""
Yet, many people call C++ and its ilk (eg: Java) ""object oriented."" So, even if there *was* a rigorous definition, the term has been rather perveted over time.

Here's [Kay himself on a Quora question on this topic](https://www.quora.com/What-did-Alan-Kay-mean-by-I-made-up-the-term-object-oriented-and-I-can-tell-you-I-did-not-have-C++-in-mind).

Various people have tried to take a somewhat more rigorous approach, but it is more attempts at cataloging techniques (eg: the Gang of Four book) than a real formal mathematical basis."
2353,AskProgramming,"Is there anything that works in C, but not in C++?","There are plenty of things that are valid C but not valid C++.

2354,AskProgramming,How to type 𝕌𝕟𝕚𝕔𝕠𝕕𝕖 in real-time?,"It's called a Compose key or an AltGr key.

They are similar in concept, but different in execution. AltGr is a lot like a shift. In some systems, AltGr, short for Alternate Graphics/Grapheme, can be stroked and released before the target key is stroked, i.e. AltGr - C. In others, it is truly like a shift where it must be held down while the target key is stroked, i.e. AltGr + C. Just as the Shift modifier gives alphabetical keys a different case, i.e. C instead of c, the AltGr gives all keys a different symbol, like numeric keys, though usually related to the base key. Depending on keyboard mapping, AltGr - C might be © or ç or some other key. Because Shift + 4 = $, AltGr + 4 is usually € or £ or some other currency symbol common in the user's locale.

The Compose key works differently. While some implementations of the AltGr modifier makes it a deadkey, a key that appears to do nothing when stroked, all implementations of the Compose key are deadkey implementations, with most of them allowing Shift-like hold-and-stroke functionality. The way the Compose key works is by stacking multiple keystrokes to attempt to approximate the underlying glyph/grapheme/symbol/character you're after. For instance, the section symbol, §, looks like two S letters intertwined, so the section symbol might be achieved with Compose-S-S. Unfortunately, the German letter ersatz es, ß, is also conceptually two S letters back to back, so the section symbol is instead implemented with Compose-S-O. The Japanese Yen currency symbol, ¥, can be Compose-Y-=, etc. On my Arch Linux system, the available ""standardized"" Compose key combinations are found in /usr/share/X11/locale/en\_US.UTF-8/Compose. It's so bloated because you usually don't care about the case of the base keys, or their order, so Compose-C-O for the copyright symbol, ©, is also encoded there as Compose-C-o, -O-c, -O-C, -o-c, -o-C, just to cover all the bases. The usual use for the Compose key is for what Unicode refers to as combining diacritics. The reason -c-O and -c-o are not listed above as creating the copyright symbol is because they are used to generate the upper and lower case O with a breve accent above, Ǒ & ǒ. Personally, I would have combined keys with the left paren to get those, but I didn't write the standard Compose configuration file. But that's alright, because I can just create my own \~/.XCompose, that's a hidden file in my own home directory, if you're not familiar with UNIX-isms. In there, I can add my own compose key sequences to give alternate sequences to existing symbols, or give new sequences to symbols that aren't encoded yet. That last part is the only tricky bit, because it will require you to do an ""Insert Special Character"" in some app in order to be able to copy-paste the character code into your .XCompose file, but the glory of it is, that will be the last time you have to use that technique to get at that symbol.

If you're shackled to a non-FOSS OS like Microsoft, there are implementations of the Compose key for various versions of Windows. Pick one, download it, build it, whether with their closed source compiler Visual Studio, or by installing a binary of GCC, and go to town. I'm sure Apple has their own similar system, but it would likely be different than any of the ones I've detailed here, though since I don't use MacOS, I wouldn't know.

Most symbols encoded using AltGr and Compose are just alternate forms of punctuation and accented letters. I use Compose-period-period to get an ellipsis, …, and Compose-dash-dash-dash to get an em dash, —, quite a lot. A writer in Spanish would use Compose-question mark-question mark to get the inverted question mark, ¿. For all the CJK block, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, characters, if writing in those languages, I'm sure there are ways to latch in alternate keyboard mappings in your user environment. Because I use GNOME/Wayland, I can take advantage of the Keyboard Layout feature and have installed an extension which lives in my top panel to switch between US English, Russian, German, Greek, Hebrew, and Cherokee layouts. Even without the extension I don't have to break stride while typing across any of those alphabets, because I can stroke Alt-Caps Lock to cycle through those keyboard mappings and while in any one of them, Ι ψαν ξθστ τυπε ᎵᎢᎸᎡ ᎢᏔ ᎳᎠᏍ ᎾᎣᏛᏅᎠᎵ… ahem. I can just type like it was normal. This doesn't magicly gift my key caps with the symbols, however, so I have to develop a touch typing skill set anew for each alphabet.

As for all of the bullets and wing-dings and whatever else you young people are into typing these days, that's up to you. My suggestion would be if the ones you want to use are not already in the system you choose, find out how that system allows you to add symbols to it and encode them yourself.

2365,AskProgramming,What are the pros and cons of container technology?,"Containers are relatively lightweight, meaning each developer can run the whole stack on their laptop and work in an isolated environment, even if a VM-based solution like Vagrant might crash the same machine.

Dockerfiles or compose files can become a maintenance burden all their own.

You can't assume that your container environment will be identical to your production environment, unless your production environment itself is containerized. 

Easy and safe access to the running app can drastically speed up code-test-iterate cycles.

With decent tooling, managing the containers can be painless. The trade-off is that setting up the tooling is an up-front pain in the ass. `docker-compose` and `make` are your best friends."

You hear the success stories because they are exceptional.  

Now, coding is like construction: there are lots of tools and techniques - and every company has their preferred set of them. The important point is not actually the tools you know, it’s how deeply you understand the underlying concepts - avoiding bugs and .  It’s also how fast you can learn and solve unexpected problems.

So, how does it sound now?  Just like construction, start with a job that’s building simple things in a high quality way - like setting up websites, or writing macros for Excel sheets, or using public APIs to access data.  The goal is to build high quality outcomes. Your question about deep vs wide “skills” is something you’ll find comes as a consequence of doing your job well.

2376,AskProgramming,ELI5: How do computers perform computations so quickly?,"Computer engineer here.

The answer to your question starts with the propogation speed of an applied voltage on a circuit. It occurs within pico- to nanoseconds depending on what the wire is made of. If I apply a voltage to one end* of a really long wire, I can observe that voltage on the other end nearly instantly. The flow of electrons through the wire is wire slow, but there's a difference between current and potential (voltage).

Next, the ""wires"" inside a computer are very small circuits -- complete with semiconductors. These semiconductors are built to be transistors. Tldr, transistors send a signal when voltage conditions are just right. If you stack those transistors in the right order, you can make logic gates. Those gates are the basic ""brains"" of your processor, just simple circuits consisting of a few transistors that only emit a signal if input conditions are right. So when you stack these gates, and eventually more complicated logic circuits, you do introduce something called propogation delay into your machine. These are measurable and must be accounted for when designing some processor. 

Regardless of this delay, that voltage signal is passing through the line at a ridiculous speed. Your processor doesn't use all billion+ transistors sequentially for one calculation. There are dedicated paths and hardware that get turned on or off depending on what operation is being performed. And with each transistor operating at near- picosecond speed, you're still only talking about something on the order of nanoseconds for 1000 transistors, and microseconds for 100,000 transistors.

Edit: end, not and"
2377,AskProgramming,Do some machine instructions create more heat than others?,"Yes.

Most electrical watts degenerate into heat watts.  Discrete components consume watts (such as transistors, resistors, capacitors).  Some instructions make use of more discrete components than others.

AFAIK, compiler developers only care about resource usage (CPU, memory), not heat.  However, lower CPU usage will generally lower power consumption and therefore heat.

However, I am not an expert.   In college I took computer architecture and compiler design classes, and I've only done business systems since graduating."
2378,AskProgramming,Can someone who is good (or even mediocre) at programming explain why a game can’t just constantly save?,"I'm going to go against the grain here, I don't think there is an inherent technical problem. While it would be inefficient to perform a regular save operation every short time frame, asynchronously keeping a log would not be that bad for most games. You don't need to save all the state all the time, just the difference and only those differences that follow from user input (as the rest can be recomputed). Doing this asynchronously you don't need to wait for the disk, that happens in the background.

I think the real issue is that it would be hard to specify for the user exactly what point they want to return to. Obviously returning to the last state is rarely useful (unless perhaps the computer suddenly crashed) so the gamer needs to specify a point in the past. Discrete points the user recognizes is generally going to be more convenient than having to pick a point from a continuous timeline. Moreover, many games would become too easy if you did that."
2379,AskProgramming,Do people/teams at big companies whose programming resulted in major exploits get fired?,"No, because these people probably won't make the same mistake again, so firing them is pointless.

2380,AskProgramming,ELI5 - What is an API?,"Your confusion is probably stemming from the fact that ""API"" is really a description of ""how"", and to some extent ""why"", rather than any specific ""what"".

For example, if you're familiar with the concept of a class, you're probably also familiar with the idea that a class can have public methods and properties which other classes can access, and it can also have private fields which other classes can't see. In an abstract sense, the public methods and properties are the ""API"" for the class.

We can then go up a level and talk about a whole compiled assembly, like a library. A library will have a bunch of code that nothing can directly touch. It's all private. But it will also expose certain useful methods to people who want to use that library. That set of publicly accessible points is the ""API"" for the library.

Up another level, and you might talk about a webservice. The webservice will have a bunch of code that runs on the back end, that consumers (or clients) will never really know about. You can change how it works, and clients don't care. But there will also be the ""service endpoints"" which is what clients can actually use. Those endpoints are the API for the webservice.

The ""why"" of API's is one of the foundational principles of good design: We use API's in order to separate interfaces from implementations. If you google ""separation of interface from implementation"" or ""separation of concerns"" you'll get *lots* more information about this!

So when someone uses the term ""API"" in a conversation, they'll always be using it to mean ""some well defined set of interfaces that I can consume if I want to, as opposed to the ""guts"" which are hidden but make it all work"". But exactly ""what"" kind of thing they're talking about depends on the context of the conversation."
2381,AskProgramming,How important is regex in real world applications?,"It's used constantly. People are often faced with little, tiny parsing tasks here and there, and it's easier to write a short, simple regex than work your way through a string in some other way. It's already there in most popular modern languages, anyway.  

That being said, most people I know don't do the kind of hardcore regex you might see online. They just pick up bits and pieces as they need it."
2382,AskProgramming,Does anyone ever spend a whole day writing code and feel like they get very little done?,"I doubt you're actually bad, you are putting too much pressure on yourself for using a product you're not yet familiar with.

2388,AskProgramming,"How do people see ""bad code""? What do they mean when they say ""oh, this code is garbage""?","Look at some of the entries in [https://thedailywtf.com/](https://thedailywtf.com/)

A is the most true, recognizing bad code comes mostly with experience. 

B is subjective: readable code is *often* better and unreadable code is *usually* worse, but it's quite possible to write perfectly readable and clear code which is nonetheless a horrendous way to solve the problem (see the Daily WTF for examples). 

C has very little to do with it, yes there are some (usually older) languages which almost force you to use practices which would be considered 'bad' in other languages, but bad code typically transcends language. It's usually about the underlying concept, not the language.

D sometimes it can be subjective, but (again see the Daily WTF) in general there is a pretty universal feel for 'bad' vs 'good' code.

As for the books, yes, there are still useful things to be learned from those books, they are for the most part about principles which still hold true."
2389,AskProgramming,does programmers from developing countries/third world countries have a chance on this field?,"If you have internet you can learn to code and contribute to code from anywhere in the world. It might be hard to find a traditional-pay job from Sudan but there are lots of ways to make money on things like bug bounties or project work.

The real power comes from learning how to program and have knowledge in another area. So study medicine and then be a doctor or make software for doctors.

Short answer is ""yes you have a chance"". You might have to hustle some. That's life."
2390,AskProgramming,How does a server “listen”?,"Two main ways that I know of.

The simple one is called polling. Basically the server will keep on checking if anyone has called it. This kind of sucks, there's a delay between these checks and it wastes CPU.

The other option is interrupts. The server (specifically whatever process is running the server) essentially does nothing/sleeps until it's woken up by an interrupt. The interrupt is issued by a network request (that part doesn't sleep). Beyond that idk the details but I think it's something low level in OS of the machine hosting the server.

Google those terms for more info as this isn't in much detail."
2391,AskProgramming,is this normal for a computer science programming job? should I stick around?,"4 months for basic hiring paperwork is not normal. They're jerking you around. Why give you full benefits and pay if you're willing to continue working without them? I'd bet my kidney that if you put in your 2 weeks that paperwork would suddenly go through. If that happens do not take it, its a bad precedent for how you'll be treated."
2392,AskProgramming,How do I know my code runs on different machines?,"It's not just the instruction set alone. For example, every operating system provides different system call interfaces. They differ in the kind of services provided by the system calls (like reading/writing files). And the convention how a system call in the operating system is invoked from the assembly differs as well.

That's one of the reasons that you need to compile separately for each ISA/OS combination whenever a program runs on the CPU's instruction set directly. (ISA = instruction set architecture)

If you want to compile only once and have it run on all platforms, you need something like Java that compiles to CPU independent bytecode. But then, you need a virtual machine to run those Java programs. And that virtual machine again is compiled separately for each ISA/OS combination.

For C, you need to compile your code with a compiler that's configured to produce code for your target ISA/OS combination. If you install a gcc on your development system, it's typically set up to produce code for your development system's ISA/OS combination. If you are developing on an x86 Windows but want to create your binaries for a Linux running on an ARM CPU, you need to install a cross-compiler that targets Linux for ARM.

You still need to be careful about writing your code in a portable manner, like using libraries that are available across your target systems. And your C code itself must be portable. For example, your code should not have any silent assumptions about the target architecture, like the size of a pointer.

Hope that helps."
2393,AskProgramming,How does CheatEngine work?,"Most operating systems have some way to read and/or write other processes memory. For instance, in Windows there is [ReadProcessMemory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-readprocessmemory) and [WriteProcessMemory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory) that allows any process (with a handle that allows it) to read and write in the target process memory."
2394,AskProgramming,Why most new programming languages use postfix type definitions?,"because that's the way it's done in ML (Meta Language, not Machine Learning) languages, which are the current mining fields for language features. the main feature that affects this discussion is type inference.

the reason those languages use postfix is because you can give a list of types. if x could be a string, int, or object,

    string | int | object: x

versus

    x: string | int | object

the second way is easier to tell where the variable name is. it also makes it easier to leave off the types and let the inference engine do its thing. if you have

    let x = 5

is x supposed to be the type and that's a syntax error? or is x a variable with inferred type? Java and c#, for example, introduced the var keyword for inference because it's a syntax error to not have something in the type position."
2395,AskProgramming,How do applications request for RAM from the CPU?,"> and NOT the theoretical CompArch/ OS answer

Then you're not going to get an answer, since a way for applications to request the RAM they need is a facility provided by the operating system. It's really got nothing to do with the CPU. The CPU will ensure an application cannot use RAM to which the OS has not granted access, but that's not _requesting_ the RAM in the first place."

2404,AskProgramming,How are object oriented programming languages implemented?,"(note: v-table = virtual table)

So C++ is written in C, the classes are structs with v-tables. They are dictionaries for functions. When you inherit a class, you get their base v-table, all those entries. If someone who inherits it wants to override it, they can and instead of the base class getting an entry in the v-table, it is the derived class. 

As the language evolved, we keep a bigger v-table, so that if you wanted to, you could cast a derived as the base, call the base function and the v-table knows where that function is located.

2407,AskProgramming,"Currently, is there anything a mobile (Android/iOS) app can do that a website can't?","Yes, native apps, besides being written for a native UX (assuming developers take advantage of native development workflows and patterns, rather than shipping an Electron / React Native app), can use native APIs which result in better apps, both in terms of developer productivity, and app capabilities and features.

For example, on Android, a wealth of APIs are available through Google Play Services and the Android OS:

- Powerful location APIs
- SafetyNet / Play Integrity APIs
- Android Keystore
- Native authentication APIs, including biometric
- Ability to register intents, handlers, app actions (e.g., to allow integration with voice assistant) + run in the background
- Much more powerful notifications that users can interact with
- The granular permissions model of the OS, which enables access to all these

- Ability to provide widgets
- ML Kit, providing on-device, performant APIs to run common ML workflows like vision, natural language processing, etc. that's actually performant and won't kill your battery
- gRPC

iOS has its own suite of capable APIs that native apps can integrate with.

> And most websites now offer the choice to add a web shortcut to one's mobile home screen - which functions similarly to an app, in that when you tap on it, it opens the website in question.

That's called a progressive web app, and they're not at all the same in terms of performance or capabilities."
2408,AskProgramming,Is it possible to write an API such that a GET request deletes things and a DELETE request gets things?,"Something you might run into if you misuse HTTP verbs is that if you put a cache like a CDN in front of your web app, that might make assumptions about your endpoints, like whether they are idempotent or not."
2409,AskProgramming,What's up with Ruby? Why is no one talking about it?,"Python grew out of C and Unix culture, and so a lot of the standard library was immediately familiar to experienced users.

2410,AskProgramming,Biggest difference between college and professional programming?,"My first job in 2008 was working on a decade-old C++ system, with support for half-a-dozen OS families, built out of about 10,000 different files.

So, a few key differences:

- The software was built by dozens of people, some no longer at the company
- The software was built over the course of years, with a lot of the layering of cruft that you'd imagine
- Many version branches of the software, with a sliding window of support from the company
- The software received professional support of already-released versions, sometimes with fixes back-ported from later versions and supplied to customers as ""hot fixes""

I'd categorize those as differences in scale, and in longevity. Most of what I did in college was maybe a couple thousand lines (often much less), usually solo but sometimes of a team of up to 4 people. Dev time measured in weeks to a month, perhaps (not full-time work either). No use of a significant build system, revision control, etc. No real testing (aside from bare-bones ""does this work for the expected inputs""). And once the project was graded, it could usually be cast aside."

2416,AskProgramming,What is Functional Programming ? What other kinds of programming are out there ?,"Functional programming is a programming paradigm. In functional programming, the problem is solved by applying and composing functions. In practice, this means that functions  are first class entities, they can be assigned to identifiers (more or less variables), they can be passed as parameters etc. 

Other common programming paradigms are: 

* procedural programming - the code is split into variables and functions
* object-oriented programming - the code is split into objects that have both attributes (a concept similar to variables) and methods (a concept similar to functions)

More exotic programming paradigms are: 

* logic 
* mathematical
* reactive"

They are shoehorned into Java and they simulate functional programming by creating anonymous classes under the hood.

Java can't accept functions as parameters so to do that it basically creates a new class with just that method and calls it.

I am really a fan of functional programming but when writing Java i tend to avoid it at all costs. It's not worth it unless is not a performance critical part of the program AND the code is replacing is much more messy and complex."

2429,AskProgramming,Is it better to learn a low level language or high level language after learning Python?,"What to learn next is always a good question but the answer is not necessarily a new language. Because on some level they are all the same. And you won't learn anything if you stay on that level with each new language you pick up. So, when you really wanna look at another language, I think you should pick one that is in some way very different.

Given the choices Java and C, that's C, because you'll have to think about resources all the time, especially memory. As a challenge you could rewrite some Python code in one of your projects in C and [call it from Python](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#api-mode-calling-c-sources-instead-of-a-compiled-library).

Java is really not that different on many levels. It's object-oriented, it has a garbage collector, it has the same control flow mechanisms, and it uses exceptions for error handling.

All that being said, I'd actually question how proficient you really are, as in, there are probably a lot of things you don't know you don't know (as opposed to the things you know you don't know). So, what is it you know about Python, what makes you think you're proficient? My guess is that you know the syntax very well and how to put things into classes and functions. But do you really know why that's a good thing and how to do it in a way to keep code maintainable and extendible? Can you name, explain and implement any programming pattern? Because that's really the next level and you can do it all in Python. And once learned you can take it to almost any other language, and it'll make it even easier to learn other languages."

2431,AskProgramming,"How are the most ""low level"" dll's made?","A binary application is an executable file. A DLL is just a compiled library. In broad sense, the main difference between a binary and a library is a binary has a ""main"" function and a library just has a public API an application (or other library) can use.

You make a library by compiling your code into one, and when you compile applications, there is a portion of the process, called linking, that links the binary to these libraries.

To answer your question about how to connect to the webcam, that really depends on the webcam. If the manufacturer uses a custom API, you'll have to interface with that. I'm pretty sure that's unlikely this day and age so the more likely scenario is you'll have to use the Windows API to do it. 

I'm not a Windows developer so my information may not be exactly accurate, but I believe the solution these days is to use the Microsoft Media Foundation API.  Microsoft has an article how to do that [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation).

If you look at this article, look at **Step 1** under ""Enumerate Capture Devices"". If you follow the link to the MFCreateAttributes function it gives you information about it. Down at the bottom of that page there is a requirements and it says ""Header"", ""Library"", and ""DLL"". This is the information you need to include with your compiler to use the API. You'll see it uses Mfplat.dll.

The short answer is yes, there is a font cache of rendered glyphs, there is no reason to keep them in GPU memory though. Once you have the cache it's trivial to assemble glyphs CPU-side.

If the glyph size isn't in the cache and the platform supports GPU-accelerated text rendering, the it works like any other GPU application. You extract the information from the font file, process it into a set of vertices, and send it to the GPU to be rendered."

2436,AskProgramming,"Conceptually, is a Struct just a dumbed down object?","This is language specific, but It is roughly a contiguous block of memory that has well defined delimiters (from a code reader perspective) and which can be padded to align to the memory grid. The concept predates objects and classes."
2437,AskProgramming,What exactly are hash tables?,"Imagine you have a mapping of usernames to user information like this:

* johndoe1 → (name: ""John"", email: ""johndoe@example.com"")
* alice → (name: ""Alice"", email: ""alice@example.com"")
* etc.

You want to be able to do a *lookup* of a particular user using their username. The username, being unique for every user, is called a *key*.

If you were to store this information naively, as an array for example, then a lookup would require you to go through the list one-by-one and compare the username to the the requested username for each entry. So in the worst case (if it's the last one) you'll need to go through the entire list until you hit the user you're looking for.

A hash table is a data structure that allow you to do lookups much more quickly. You create an array of a certain predetermined size (let's say 256). And then you ""hash"" the username to some index between 0-255. So ""johndoe1"" might hash to 132, ""alice"" to 42, etc. And you store the user information at the corresponding location in the array. There are many possible hash functions, a good hash function will be as random as possible but will always hash each input to a fixed hash.

Now, if you want to do a lookup of ""alice"", you just hash that username to get 42, and then you go straight to the corresponding array index: `users[42]` is your user entry.

A problem here is, since there's only 256 possible ""slots"", what do you do if you get clashes (for example if there are more than 256 users there must be at least one clash). This is called a hash collision, and there are multiple ways to solve it. Most commonly you will just gather all the users with the same hash in a list, and then go through that list the ""naive"" way."
2438,AskProgramming,How do I stop being a mediocre software developer?,"I think you should try not to use too many new things for a given project.

I’d say set a clear plan of what technologies/frameworks you want to use for a project, and then execute it with those. If you want to change it, you can do it afterwards. 

One big problem with personal projects for me is that I expand the scope too far when I’m starting and then once the novelty wears off I don’t want to do it anymore because there’s too much to do. If I had set clear boundaries at the beginning, I could at least get to a minimum viable product."
2439,AskProgramming,Is any software ever truly complete?,"Research UNIX 7th Edition's version of /bin/true has the unique distinction of being a complete implementation of the original feature specification, but being perfectly efficient in implementation and having no bugs or warts to be removed or cleaned up in later iterations.  Every later implementation was equivalent or strictly worse.

2440,AskProgramming,"Is it normal for programmers to have ""Language Amnesia""?","Yes, 100%. It's a lot of information to keep track of. Also you sometimes get your wires crossed and try to use syntax from the wrong language. What matters most is your ability to solve abstract programming problems. You can just google the forgotten syntax in like 5 seconds."
2441,AskProgramming,How does being good at math help with programming?,"I believe the biggest thing in common between Maths and programming is Logic ! in other words, the way you solve your problems. 

Being good in math can for example help you with iterative loops as it is very similar to math series, with dealing with lists ..."
2442,AskProgramming,How does the OS decide when to use different cores?,"The OS's scheduler decides what threads to run. Each process has at least one thread, and only one thread can run per core. So at face value, on a 12 core CPU you can only do 12 things.

The OS decides what thread will run on what core, and it rotates the running threads based on a set of rules and priorities to allow each program to advance a bit.

I'm not sure how e and p cores are decided on, I'm sure if you operate at a low enough level there will be an Intel library to allow you to influence that sort of thing. I imagine it is simply done based on the type of instruction being executed (complex on the performance, basic on the effecient)."

2444,AskProgramming,"Difference between ""from A import B"" and ""import A.B"" in python?","From the [Python glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html):

>	**module**
>	
>	An object that serves as an organizational unit of Python code. Modules have a namespace containing arbitrary Python objects. Modules are loaded into Python by the process of [importing](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-importing).
>	
>	See also [package](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-package).

>	**package**
>	
>	A Python [module](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-module) which can contain submodules or recursively, subpackages. Technically, a package is a Python module with an `__path__` attribute.
>	
>	See also [regular package](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-regular-package) and [namespace package](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-namespace-package).

When you think of a package, you're almost always thinking of a regular package which is define as follows:

>	**regular package**
>	
>	A traditional [package](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-package), such as a directory containing an `__init__.py` file.
>	
>	See also [namespace package](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-namespace-package).

The term “library” technically has no Python-specific meaning but can refer to any module.

I feel that the definition of “subpackage” should be obvious. It's just a package within a package.

The term “distribution” refers to a different but related topic. You don't need to know anything about it unless you want to share a package with others.

In short, a module is simply a collective unit of other Python objects. A module can be a file or a directory. A library is the same thing as a module. A package is a module, usually containing an `__init__.py` file.

As for your titular question, the main difference between the two examples is the name that they get imported as. The first makes the imported object accessible as `B`. The second makes the imported object accessible as `A.B`."
2445,AskProgramming,How do compilers run in our system?,"This is called [bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_\(compilers\)).

Although a modern C compiler might itself be written in C, at some point in time there must have been some C compiler that was written in a different, earlier language. If you follow the history back far enough, you'll eventually get to a point where somebody manually produced the machine code for a basic assembler and fed it into a computer somehow, perhaps with punched cards or tape, or perhaps literally by toggling it in through the computer's front panel."
2446,AskProgramming,Licensing Related Question: Where do I credit the 3rd party libraries that I used?,"I add a data-license=“” attribute to the script tag and insert the url of the library’s README or other page describing the library and its terms of use.

I would consider it unprofessional to have a “credits” page thanking them and the Academy for the Oscar, although I have seen all manner of such nonsense in the humans.txt file, so if I felt I absolutely had to make a show of my acknowledgment, it would be an easter egg for those who cared to look.

The only exception would be open street maps or something that requires a one-line credit at the bottom of any page using their APIs."
2447,AskProgramming,What's the difference?,"A large part of why you would choose a language is the ecosystem.

For example, if I wanted to create an ML model, I would likely use Python, as it has TensorFlow. If I wanted to write code for a microcontroller I'd likely use C, as most microcontrollers have SDKs for C.

After that, it's largely preference. I prefer C# over Java for building web apis, but you can also consider using python or javascript."
2448,AskProgramming,Looking for someone to code review my C# application?,"I'm just chiming in to say ""good for you"", in more ways than one.

First, it's great that you're actively seeking constructive criticism/code review on a personal project.  You'd be surprised how many people I work with that think that code review is a formality or ""company requirement"", and wouldn't bother seeking one out if they didn't have to.

Second, after just glancing through the code - it's obvious that you've put a lot of effort into doing things ""right"".  It's structured and written in more professional manner than what I see sometimes in my job (in a company of 58K people).  I see things like some dependency injection, which is a great step.

I'm not sure if I have time for a thorough review - one thing I'll say is that it might help us review if you can provide some info around what this is intended for: what it does, how it does it (generally speaking), what the use-case is, etc.  I didn't see that anywhere in the Github repo (although I apologize if I missed it).

Finally - one thing I did notice - it's using quite a bit of in-line SQL, some of it fairly extensive.  In general, this isn't a great practice, for a number of reasons - the risk of SQL injection, for example; lack of transparency, the need to recompile the app if something has to change in the database, and security are all other reasons to use stored procedures.  I would consider this."
2449,AskProgramming,How difficult would this project be?,"Definitely not hard, you can use something like an arduino (a small programamable microcontroller) to control a pump through a relay and then have it be triggered whenever you'd like to. You can find guides for arduino controlled pumps all over the place. The hardest thing might just be having connecting it to a steady water source, but the programming itself will be incredibly simple"
2450,AskProgramming,How exactly does a random function work ?,"Generally, there are two types of randomness: true (cryptographic) randomness and pseudorandomness (sometimes these are used in conjunction to generate large amounts of mostly cryptographically secure randomness).

Most programs (where cryptographically secure randomness isn't needed) use pseudorandom algorithms, which generally take a seed and generate a seemingly random pattern using it. One of the more commonly used implementations is the mersenne twister algorithm.

In these algorithms, there is usually a hidden state, which is mutated after getting every value (the value is derived from the state, but usually isn't the state itself).

Cryptographically secure randomness is usually influenced by some non-easily-derivable / -influenceable source, such as electric noise."
2451,AskProgramming,Hardware noob. Arduino or rasbery pi?,"Raspberry is a computer, Arduino is a micro-controller. Which one to get entirely depends on your needs."
2452,AskProgramming,Does any language have syntax for X is equal to EITHER Y or Z ?,"Python I believe has:

    x in {y, z}"
2453,AskProgramming,How can I make atomic commits when working on a new project?,"I think one thing to realize is that you don't need to get the atomic commits right first time, and can rework things until the point you share your work with other people. So when you realize halfway through working on something that you need some other feature first, you can create a temporary commit, maybe on a new branch to get it out of the way, and then later when you want to come back to this you can cherry pick the commit, or `rebase -i` etc as appropriate, to rework this commit and get the code and commit message into the state you want. You can do this as much as you want  until something's been shared, to try and get history in a good state for when you do share it.

On the other hand, especially when you're just scoping things out in the early stages of a project, you might decide this is too much work. Eventually not a single line you write early on might be in the final codebase, so you might decide in the interest of moving faster and experimenting that you keep your commits slightly less atomic early on, and just include several things you worked on in each. How you strike this balance depends on the project, how much you care about this early history, and your judgement."
2454,AskProgramming,How to facilitate teen?,"I think you could be overestimating his skills a tiny bit. I started programming in middle school and was praised similarly in high school. Breezed through the first year of college because there was no challenges. Smacked straight into a wall second year and have been continuously challenged to learn more ever since - I'll be entering my senior year after this summer.

For example, you mention he's programmed his own OS. That's an insane feat, if true - an OS would typically take something like 10 years to be functional. What is much more likely is that he's installed and customized a Linux distribution - certainly not unimpressive, but far from writing an OS. In fact I *you* could probably do it in less than a day if you tried.

There's also a massive difference between writing code, and knowing how to develop software. I'd be willing to bet he knows absolutely nothing about graph theory or set theory. If I were to guess, there are approximately 12 credits I've taken that he might pass without seriously studying in the course.

I'd strongly recommend getting him into a club of some sort. Communication skills are actually *more important* in the software world than software skills. Being able to write code as an individual is great, but basically every company will have you working in a team with other developers. College courses also lean heavily on group projects. I had two entire courses that were 4 person group projects. Like, the entire course had 1 grade, and that group project was it."
2455,AskProgramming,Is Assembly or C faster in practice?,"For 99.9% of developers, compiled C code will be faster because most people don't have the skills to extract high performance out of assembly. Hell, most developers don't have the skills to extract high performance out of C. 

For those 1/1000 developers, it is possible to write some key portions of the code in assembly and get higher performance. It's really important to know that this usually isn't because the human is ""better"" at assembly programming. A human can make assumptions about how the program will be used that enables optimizations. Things like valid arguments, ranges of inputs, etc."
2456,AskProgramming,Why pointers?,"> Why pointers?

If you have a big chunk of data you need to pass to a function, would you like to create a copy of all that data and pass it (i.e. passing by value), or just pass the address of it (i.e. passing by pointer)?"
2457,AskProgramming,Why is there a lack of tooling that helps understand large codebases?,"I just don't think it's possible to \`extract\` that kind of meaning. i.e. here's 1million lines of code in 50,000 modules -> click a button -> ""ok what we have here is basically 8 subsystems arranged in three layers that communicate using these protocols. One of them appears to be a rubbish home-rolled implementation of a relational database"". it's a fantasy. However, it's such a nice fantasy that I would love to start a project that documents, at a high level, the components of important open source software. Firefox has 3 million lines of code?...

2459,AskProgramming,"What is the relevance of either java or .net, as far as companies that use them and what they use them for?","Both are pretty excellent skills to have. While smaller web companies might prefer the quick wins you get from building back-end services in Node or Python, larger companies tend to prefer static languages like Java and C# (.NET is just a C# framework). In my experience, Java is more widely used in the financial sector, .NET more widely used in commerce and retail. I'm sure there's exceptions to that, and I can only speak for my little bubble anyway. But that's my experience.

Both are also still really widely used in desktop and mobile development. Java isn't used so much in game development anymore (Minecraft being a pretty huge exception) but the Unity Engine runs on C#, so it's definitely still relevant."
2460,AskProgramming,How do I get productive while programming?,"Why do you open your IDE if you don't know what you're going to do?

Really the most effective approach here is to scratch an itch. But you need to have an itch first. It might be stupid small but that's enough to trick your brain into throwing an over-engineered solution at it."

2465,AskProgramming,What’s up with the dislike toward OOP?,"One of the common arguments, usually coming from a fan of functional programming, is that OOP is messy because you've got little puddles of state hiding throughout the program. What is the output of some function? Hard to say, since its output relies on inputs besides the directly-supplied parameters (i.e. the state within some object will change the output of a method defined in that object's class). That's a property that makes the code harder to test, and harder to reason about.

The argument concerning performance that I know tends to come from C programmers, who feel that things like destructors, exceptions, and garbage collection suck because they're code that implicitly runs at often-unpredictable times. Dynamic dispatch sucks because there's an extra layer of indirection that hurts performance, but *also* because you don't know what code's going to run when you make the call. Programmers of a certain background are uncomfortable with both of those points.

IME, some use of object orientation can be a benefit in structuring a program, but it can certainly be overdone (deep inheritance hierarchies, ""God objects"" that are basically bastions of global state, and it *can* be hard to diagnose performance issues in some cases). Mostly, OOP provides more benefit than detriment...but then, I'm not trying to use a bunch of dynamic allocation and exception-heavy code on a microcontroller or something."
2466,AskProgramming,What is Linux's appeal to devs?,"Honestly, no one should feel compelled either way. Use what you like. 

I'm old, and historically, you operated a Unix system by thinking like a programmer rather than by thinking like a user, and when you're a programmer, that's powerful. If you need to rename a thousand files according to some pattern, a Windows user would try to find some piece of shareware that specifically was meant to rename files. A Unix user would more like throw together some quick shell pipeline that employed general-purpose file and text manipulation tools like `find` and `sed`. The latter is a transferable skill in a way that finding the right shareware really isn't. The more you do with these tools, the more of your computing life you *can* use them for, and that breeds a lot of efficiencies.

This is much less true today. You have WSL, Powershell, etc., that are all capable ways of doing whatever you'd want to do. I use Linux or other unix-ish systems today because they're what I'm familiar with. Linux has gotten a bit less ""just edit some text files"" for configuration, and Windows has gotten more usable, so kind of whatever."
2467,AskProgramming,Why are JS errors haunting most websites these days?,"There can be a lot of scripts loaded for third-party vendors for analytics and tracking purposes. These scripts might even be managed by the business instead of the engineers.

2468,AskProgramming,Was the LAMP stack popular in 2003/2004 back when Zuckerberg used it to build the first version of facebook?,"Back then, using the lamp stack was about the only way to do actual web application development for free, and the barrier to entry for us was very low."
2469,AskProgramming,Why are so many people trying to scare new aspiring developers away from this field with ChatGPT?,">Lately, I noticed a lot of posts all over the internet, claiming that ChatGPT/AIs will replace all web/software developers within the next 3-5 years.

Are people actually saying that? ffs 🙄 Bunch of morons that don't know what they're on about.  
    
I've noticed it too, it's usually the novices that have just entered programming that try to shut the door behind them. Just try to spread the world that they should be ignored.  
  
These college grads hear a buzzword like ChatGPT and hear how it is able to say ""hello"" and parrot a couple lines of code (that was written by humans on the internet) and think it's the end of human programming. 🤦‍♂️"
2470,AskProgramming,How useful is regex? Is it more convenient or time/space efficient than using regular string operations?,"It's extremely convenient for parsing quite cumbersome inputs without writing a gazillion lines of code. Especially when that, simple programming, far exceeds the need for speed. And it's not that super-inefficient that one might think.

That being said, should you use it everywhere? No.

And also, don't try to use it for where it's not intended, like for advanced nesting parses, or parses where you switch algorithm mid through based on previous parse state. It just gets ugly, fast."
2471,AskProgramming,Are operating systems normally designed for one person?,"It used to be that computers were expensive and dumb terminals were used to connect to them - i.e. they were a shared resource.

This has not changed, the sharing is done differently, but can be done the same way - just less common because dumb terminals are replaced with cheap powerful personal systemns.

For example, consider putty - pretty much any number (within reason) people can connect to a central linux system and work at the command line.

Don't like the command line? Look at VNC (or probably a better example X-windows and associated desktops), multiple people can connect to a Linux system and get a graphical desktop - they are all doing their own thing.

Don't like Linux, look at Remote Desktop - multiple people can connect to a central windows computer and do their own thing.

These days, that type of thing is usually done for security / admin, but it is still a thing.

But the multi-user aspect your asking about is still being done - just in a different way.

If you think about it in the ""dumb terminal"" days, these weren't completely dumb, the central server could send the terminal commands beyond ""display this character"". It could deal with escape sequences (e.g. clear screen, locate cursor, set underline, some could even do set colour). These were primitive directives, but still leveraged some basic intelligence in the terminal.

As things progressed, these ""dumb terminals"" became more and more capable until present day when they are full blown computers - i.e. ""terminals"" that can do their own thing (e.g. fancy graphics, complex presentations, animations/videos etc) using data received from even larger more powerful higher capacity central server(s) that they connect to.

For example, I have several Linux systems (including Pi). None of them have a monitor permanently attached, so I VNC or putty into them, often I will have multiple sessions active due to the way that I use them - so I am one person, but as far as the host is concerned these are all distinct sessions that could be from multiple different people.

One thing that I have noted in IT over several decades is that things change rapidly and are very different to what they were each decade prior. But equally, the more things change, the more you can see the same basic principles.

I hope that makes some sense.

BTW - it is fun/annoying to secretly plug a second mouse / keyboard into a ""victims"" computer and very infrequently just move the mouse just a little or hit a random key.  
BTW2 - Don't do that - unless you are willing to receive a punch on the nose for accidently hitting a key/moving the mouse at just the wrong time resulting in an accidental disaster (e.g. accidentally deleting a huge amount of work).

Great question BTW."
2472,AskProgramming,Which coding language would be best for this purpose?,"IMO Python will prob be the best bet (easy to work with, good for beginners, good with data manipulation).

2473,AskProgramming,What does HTML Email Developer do?,"The HTML in HTML emails is a tightly restricted subset of HTML since it can only be what's safe enough to embed in a webmail client.

2477,AskProgramming,How do I get back into full-stack web development as a hobby in 2021?,"Hey. Imo nodejs fits your needs almost perfectly, js as a language is quite simple but not as performant as compiled ones but you have really nice bonus on top: same language on fe and be. And as you've mentioned you already know js... So maybe just learn some new ecma standards and look forward to nestjs, nextjs, Koa, express for backend and react for frontend. Last one, imo, can provide very fast dev speed (especially if used with ui libraries like material ui).

As for dev/local prod/prod stages, basically, docker and k8s can give you almost everything (Nana does very good tutor videos about that).

My company uses react and Koa for fast idea prototyping and mvp (we even had our pre-built templates with common features as login and users). And it's quite good imo.

If you had any other questions - please feel free to ask"
2478,AskProgramming,Wanting to create an in-house software dev department. Not sure where to start?,"> Now we aren't exactly sure how to begin, how many people to hire, who to hire, how to manage the team, the budget to put in.
 
I think a good starting point would be to hire somebody senior who has experience building a technical team.
 
Someone who can advise you on how to organize structure things, how to build a hiring process for developers, etc. There is a lot of groundwork which needs to be done in terms of organization, process etc, and you need an expert to help you make those kinds of decisions and budget for all of this.
 
Without that kind of technical leadership background, I don't think it makes sense to try to hire and manage an entire software department yourself.
 
Ideally you can find somebody willing not just to manage this, but to get their hands dirty and personally tackle some of the initial technical stuff themselves."

If the answer is nothing, no one is going to assume that risk. The only way this is an attractive proposition for someone is - idea aside - you continue to add comparable value to them. They'll be responsible for realising the entire product. You'd better be damn good at what you do to be able to compete with that.

Maybe you're an expert salesman and you already have some orders lined up with contacts or something. Maybe you have access to huge capital. Unless they *need* you on board to succeed, a relationship like that will never work out. They'll either do it without you or become resentful of you."

2482,AskProgramming,"Why is ""zero dependencies"" seen as a good thing in software? Isn't that violating the very important principle of ""reuse code""?","Dependencies tend to have dependencies that have dependencies ad infinitum. All of those need to be kept up to date in case of security vulnerabilities, and sometimes you get a mess of dependencies to multiple versions of the same library. That's why, for a small library, not having dependencies can be a feature. 

As for contributing upstream, who has time for that. Customer pays for work on their product and wants it done now."
2483,AskProgramming,Why is double free() an error? Why couldn't the OS check during freeing memory if it's already free?,"Freeing free memory isn't a big deal, but memory isn't just free forever to go live in peace on a farm. It gets reused. If you accidentally free memory that belongs to someone else now, that can cause some issues. Warning you that you double-freed something actually helps you out a lot."
2484,AskProgramming,How do I develop smarter as a lone wolf?,"I would suggest you start revising all your scripts and check what exactly they do, how they all interact and how you could change the data flow.

2485,AskProgramming,Is Java even usable without an IDE?,">How do you import stuff from .jar?

Not really sure what you mean by this because Python always requires imports. Maybe you're asking how to manage dependencies. Maven or Gradle.

>How do you compile?

Most projects will use Maven or Gradle. They are build tools which delegate to javac, among other things. For simple projects with no dependencies, I've seen people use a Makefile which calls javac but that's quite unusual.

>Are there people who code in Java without an IDE?

Probably. Are there many? No.

Use IntelliJ. The community edition is free and has all the features you need. It's an amazing product, head and shoulders above everything else.

As primarily a Java developer, I'm continually surprised at how weak the IDE game is for other languages, and that people continue to use glorified text editors. A good IDE is not necessary to write Java code but it's necessary to maximize your productivity."
