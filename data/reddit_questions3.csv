0,AskAcademia,How about we stop working for free?,"I'm getting pretty sick of writing papers for free. For my PhD and postdoc I've worked on other people's big projects. Every time they strategically keep me in the lab for the entire duration of the fellowship with no time to write, knowing full well that I have to write papers to get a job, and that I'll do it for free when the fellowship is over just to try to keep up."
1,AskAcademia,Is it love or is it codependency?,"There's another piece to this worth considering--you offer a very rich and thoughtful description of something real here, but it goes beyond individual temperaments and it goes beyond the specific problems of academic habitus. 

It's true that academics are encouraged to love their work or have a mission or sense of vocation in ways that have always tempted them to lose track of the boundaries between work and life, notoriously so. (Hence the figure of the absent-minded professor, the obsessed literary critic who is always focused with the same interpretative intensity even while reading Goodnight Moon to their year-old child, the scientist who works 15 hours in the lab every day, and so on.) We identify with our scholarship and we are identified by others with our institutions.

There are other professions that have long been considered to have a sense of mission as well--it's why doctors get asked to do a diagnosis at a dinner party. But professors have historically intermingled self and work in powerful ways, sometimes beneficial, often not.

The extra dimension I'm thinking of, however, is that something has happened to all professional work in the United States (and to a lesser extent elsewhere, particularly in the UK) in the last thirty years. Namely, the demands that professionals show more and more and more dedication to their job, let their job intrude more and more on their lives, produce more and more value or outputs while working, and so on have happened across all of professional labor, at the same time that professionals have lost most of the autonomy and authority that used to be the hallmark of their working experience. Doctors are expected to work longer hours in more demanding circumstances and are more and more subject to the authority of non-medical management and insurers, and their places of work have been mostly consolidated into large-scale corporate systems, both profit and non-profit. Psychiatrists and psychologists the same. Lawyers are less and less likely to make senior partner in the old sense, their firms are getting bigger and more corporate and significantly more aggressive about enforcing the maximization of paid hours with clients--and if you want to make senior partner you'll not only bring in the money but you'll show that you're the person willing to work the longest hours with the fewest complaints. If you want to make it in Goldman Sachs and other firms, you'll work 18 hours and sleep on a cot and answer emails at 2am. Want to make it as a Congressional aide or be a White House political appointee? Get ready for ridiculous hours, ridiculous demands, and a complete blurring of the boundaries between your life and the job. 

So of course this has happened to many academics too, and for many, it's been as it has elsewhere--not a sudden sharp shock from a hostile takeover but millions of frogs boiling slowly to death. It's happened because of widening income inequality and thus more competition for the shrinking places at the top of the meritocracy, because of how ideologies of austerity and neoliberal management got rid of associate lawyers and tenure-track faculty and so on (while finding a place for more neoliberal managers to practice more austerity), because email and computers made it possible to do more in less time in new ways, and because work became a substitute for lives that were seeming less meaningful or satisfying or stable. 

It's important that we keep this in mind, because what's happening to us is not just happening to us--and that might be the beginnings of an answer beyond ""protect your work-life balance"". There are genuinely reasons why that's not good advice for many people in the current environment even if it would be a good goal for changing the current environment."
2,AskAcademia,Why did I pursue a PhD if it has not led to any opportunities?,"Sorry to hear this. As someone who nope-d out of academia pretty much after defending, I have mixed feelings about this, but they're mostly positive.

There's a part of me that wishes that academia was what I dreamt it was, and a part of me that wishes I had succeeded, despite it being not what I had hoped.

But I don't regret anything. I went to grad school because I loved science - not for the money (lol), or the prestige, but because I loved it as a way of acquiring knowledge and learning about the world. That's still true today, and it will probably be true my whole life. 

For me, that realization helped me overcome what I think a lot of people fear when they think about leaving academia: ""Will I ever be able to love something as much as this?""

And just like the ending of a bad relationship, despite my feelings to the contrary at the time, the answer is yes. But more importantly, it doesn't matter even if the answer is ""no"", because from what you describe, it doesn't matter how much you love academia, academia does not love you back."
3,AskAcademia,What to do about a situation where my professor wrote a negative letter of rec for grad school?,"You can try talking to her, but that will likely not accomplish anything.

Stop using that letter of recommendation."
4,AskAcademia,Does anybody feel like academic publication pressure is becoming unsustainable?,"YES!! It’s now at the point in my field that if you don’t have a science or nature paper AND a prestigious post doc, you’re basically SOL for any faculty positions.  

I have worked on meta analyses and publication bias favouring positive outcomes is completely skewing our ability to synthesis and understand actual patterns in ecological data. Which in turn is limiting our ability to apply this information accurately to evidence based policy. 

The business side of academia is ruining the actual utility of science."
5,AskAcademia,Is misogyny the only problem with the WSJ op-ed on asking Jill Biden to not use 'Dr.'?,I stopped reading the article after “kiddo”
6,AskAcademia,Anyone else fantasise about starting a brewery? Or becoming a plumber? Anyone done this?,"I call these ""escapist fantasies"". Almost everyone I know has one. They all involve starting a new life with a job that involves working with our hands and (at least in the fantasy) rarely being on a computer/behind a desk. Mine is being a florist, even though I have a black thumb and know nothing about plants."
7,AskAcademia,"""40% of Ph.D. students in the UK at high risk of suicide"". I knew Ph.D. life can be really testing, but not to this level!! How can we make the process more emotionally sustainable?","I agree with the other comment about funding, but I'd also add that I feel like a contract of some kind would be so useful. Some places already do this, and there's no reason that everywhere can't adopt this. 

A huge amount of my PhD stress came from being in this weird in-between not-a-student-not-staff liminal space. I needed credits to graduate but couldn't enroll in modules because I wasn't a student. I was teaching and responsible for printing assessment and exams but couldn't use the staff printers (for free) because I'm not staff. 

I, too, constantly had a barrage of admin screw ups often because they didn't know what to do with me. I'm not staff so I can't be enrolled with HR, but because I can't be enrolled with HR I can't receive payslips or payment, which meant I couldn't be paid for teaching. But I was teaching. It took nearly a month to get payment going but I was still not staff and still not able to get payslips. 

A contract outlining expectations and entitlements, and also just generally clarifying our role for administration would be incredibly useful."
8,AskAcademia,Does anyone else get really sleepy about 20 minutes into any Zoom call?,"Not all calls, but many. You’re not alone."
9,AskAcademia,Does anyone else feel bad for taking days off?,"Yeah, I used to do this all the time, trying to do extra studies to get more papers out, planning side businesses etc.

Ended up working myself into the ground, then catching a virus that made me weirdly tired.. Which got progressively worse and turned into severe ME/CFS. I've now been housebound, mostly lying down and unable to do pretty much anything for almost 2 years.

Definitely has given me a lot of time to reflect on my stupid decisions in the past and to think about how much health and family are the most important things in life.

Please take care of yourself. I also didn't think that anything bad could happen and was quite proud of my great work ethic. Things can change pretty quickly when some small mysterious piece stops working properly."
10,AskAcademia,"If I have 6 hours of Zoom meetings everyday, can I really be expected to get anything else done?",You have 15 projects to co supervise??? WTF??? It’s time to have a serious talk to your PI about expectations
11,AskAcademia,Do former professors miss students the way we miss them?,"I think it's less so. An individual professor or 2 can make a real difference in the life of a student as they help the student learn, change perspectives, and maybe make a life-changing decision. It happened in my life and here I am 48 years later, with a career that I can really trace to an individual professor (who remains my friend) for helping me determine. It's very powerful stuff as a student.

For a professor, this is what we do and I think many of us hear about life-changing classes and experiences on a regular, but uncommon basis. But, we're not typically intimately involved in those thought processes and decisions. I think that when we hear about them, we're gratified. And we do often hear about individual successes from individual students. Heck, I hired a TT faculty member who had taken my Intro Psych class years before who became a psychologist, he said, because of me! But, the students who I think of fondly I don't miss. I am much more interested in their successes as they move on to bigger and better things!"
12,AskAcademia,Is it weird to be the only student with the cam on?,">Is it weird if I am the only other person with a camera on besides the teacher?

You will be the beacon of hope in your professor's day (I am not even joking, that would be super kind of you). You might also start a movement."
13,AskAcademia,Has anyone here been roasted at a conference Q/A before?,"There is often one of those people. Just ignore them. While at the time it feels like you are incompetent and that people will leave thinking poorly of you, the reality is that people will leave remembering what a jerk the audience member is and thinking poorly of him."
14,AskAcademia,How to be happy for getting accepted in PhD when it seems like family and friends can't relate?,"Similar sociodemographics here…

I haven’t started my doc program yet but I spent about a decade climbing a pretty lucrative corporate ladder that moved us from dirt poor to upper middle class, so I sort of get the idea of living a separate life from family. One thing that I’d say is that graduate school, just like any other career move is an individual endeavor and no one is really going to cheerlead you every step of the way, save maybe your spouse or children. I suspect that your family is very proud of you and if you are looking for support and ask for it, they’ll be more than willing. With that said, I would hope that you are equally involved in their lives, their accomplishments, etc. and celebrate them, even if they aren’t quite “at the top”, as you say."
15,AskAcademia,Anyone so frustrated they literally start to cry?,"YES. I think it's pretty normal, especially when you throw a pandemic in the mix.

Some things that help me:

I play white noise through my noise cancelling headphones to drown out most noise and help me concentrate. I've also started making a point of asking people not to interrupt me when working with headphones on.

If I can't concentrate or start getting overwhelmed, taking a short break sometimes helps. Just getting a cup of tea of a walk around the block.

Sometimes nothing I do helps, and I could spend literal days staring at my computer doing nothing. I've found now the best way to deal with this is to give myself permission to take a day or two off just to recharge my batteries. It's more efficient to do that and come back feeling 100% than sitting at my desk all week achieving nothing.

Don't be too harsh on yourself, you're working under really difficult circumstances."
16,AskAcademia,Is this postdoc killing me? What should I do?,"I will forever beat the drum that scientists need to work less and develop some class consciousness. This is exactly what I mean. Really, you need to just fucking stop it. No meetings, no discussions, just stop it. Work 9-5 and be *hard* on yourself about that. What’s the fucking worst thing that will really happen? Maybe this psycho doesn’t renew your contract. Oh no, heaven forbid, you don’t get to work with this guy for *another* 3 years? Jesus Christ, please give yourself a shake. Your time is *valuable*. You are not in some Bangladeshi factory, you won’t be beaten or insta-fired if you decide to work human hours. 

Let me tell you this: whatever scary thing you are afraid will happen if you start acting like a normal person, it’s not worse than what will happen if you keep this up. I lost two years of my life to a mental breakdown in the middle of my first attempt at a PhD that I ended up quitting on the worst possible of terms. If I could go back in time I’d beat myself senseless until I agreed to stop drinking the Kool-Aid. Stop drinking the Kool-Aid! You don’t have to do this, you have agency. I will never side with these exploitative scumbags but at a certain point it is on you for letting yourself be completely steamrolled without standing up for your own fucking interests, because of what, peer pressure?

Join a club that starts at 6. Maybe a martial art, something that lasts more than an hour. Get a dog. Get a hobby and hold yourself to doing it. Do not set up experiments that will keep you past 5 or on the weekends. Become one of those obsessive clock watchers. Embody Stanley from The Office. *Nothing will fucking happen.*

Your PI might say they are concerned. They might say they are disappointed in you, they might give you a lecture about how science must be your hobby and vocation rather than a job. They are your enemy, ignore them. If you step back and think about it, it’s a bit laughable that you are honestly considering not availing yourself of your legal right to holidays because your PI said it would be “inconvenient”. At that point you’re just letting yourself get dommed by your literal class enemy.

You should know something that is basically a universal rule in work: The more you give, the more they take. You keep working like a slave, they will keep expecting that output and be disappointed when you falter. What you need to do now is *recalibrate their expectations* by simply stopping. No work after 5! And that includes emails. 

I insist that you develop a life and personality outside the lab. There are libraries filled with books that you may never read, how can you tolerate it? How can you tolerate staring a lab/computer when there is so much to experience in this world? And it’s yours to experience if you get a grip. Stop underestimating your value and your leverage because your coworkers do. Stop being so affected by your boss saying the kinds of things bosses always say. Step off the hamster wheel, and stop believing the bullshit.  Science is a job, not a calling. If someone out there has a comfortable life with secure employment and maybe a nice traditional nuclear family with a traditional housewife cooking and cleaning at home, so that they can consider science a “hobby” or a “passion” that’s nice for them. The rest of us are being exploited by them breaking our bodies and spirits to help them solve their little intellectual puzzles and pad their trophy shelf. 

Just stop now, it’s on you and no one else at this point."
17,AskAcademia,Would Dr. Ross Geller survive in today's academic environment?,">And yet, Dr. Geller achieved tenure in a prestigious institution at a relatively young age. How would Dr. Geller fare today?

Tbh mostly it amazes me that Dr. Geller managed to get tenure without ever being tenure track. He's hired on as a visiting professor and then 4 (?) seasons later is granted tenure without ever apparently being hired full time."
18,AskAcademia,How do I help my spouse understand that avoiding diminishing PhD hurts the entire family?,"You've pretty much got it here in the post in my opinion.

""Hey, honey, you just need to do these things, and it's really taking a toll on me being the sole income for the household."""
19,AskAcademia,How to politely say no to an important professor?,"My supervisor once sat me down to talk about drawing boundaries in academia especially in the early formative years because this is when big name academics will try and make the new entrants work/co-opt their research, authority and space. 

For a PhD student in Law it would be very acceptable to politely decline because you don’t have the time. I’ve done this already and it sounds harder than it is. Big names don’t bat an eye and it all goes away in a second. 

Another very important thing he mentioned was the power dynamics. More often than we’d like, Big Names are hungry for power and clout. Avoid scenarios where you could potentially put yourself in their sway or incur an obligation (because trust me, the BigName would see making you a co-author as a favour he is doing to you). Since job committees prefer sole authored articles over co-authored articles, it’s better to focus on getting your research out rather than teaming up with someone.
 
You’ll be fine. :) good luck!"
20,AskAcademia,"I feel like an asshole asking, but is it wrong to feel like I shouldn't get MORE work than my colleagues with children just because I haven't got children yet?","I think everyone is being expected to do more than they were previously. To take an in person course and convert it to an online one in a matter of a week or two weeks (in the case of my school) is an impossible task. Most online teachers have months to prepare the syllabus, recorded lectures and learn how to teach from a distance. For colleges there are a lot of resources, canvas, blackboard, licensed Zoom etc. My mother is a highschool ESL teacher and she's expected to flip her class online in a matter of a week with maybe a quarter of the resources and technological understanding. Luckily, her kids are grown and are good with technology lol. 

I think and know your feelings are valid, it sucks seeing others do less than you and sacrificing for them. As a parent I know they appreciate it. Educators, that are also parents are dealing with having to flip their classroom and trying to be there for their children, who are also experiencing great change and uncertainty. I know they feel as if they are failing in both areas. 

I think we need to cut everyone slack, this is unprecedented and there is so much uncertainty and not everything will go smoothly, and to expect it to it is unfair to both students and educators.

I'm just an non-traditional undergrad student with three kids suddenly home with the same schedule of coursework. Two of my classes were labs (biochemistry and ecology) and I'm pissed that I won't get to have the same education that I paid for because of this pandemic. I'm also angry at myself and the situation because my oldest is scared and lonely without school and that I can't be there for her because I have so much to do, all the time. 

Everything just sucks right now and it's okay to be upset or angry. But don't take it out on other people, communicate your feelings and let people know what you can do and cannot do. You may have to suck up some but don't take on too much that it makes you bitter toward your colleagues."
21,AskAcademia,Does anyone else think that there should be more restrictions on anything calling itself a university or college?,Universities should not be allowed to be businesses
22,AskAcademia,Why is academia so TOXIC?,"So a lot of the answers here are ""competition"" but the situations in which I have seen toxicity are generally not about people stabbing each other in the back or being resentful over the jobs or opportunities of others. The truly toxic people are usually those who don't have any direct competition, can get away with behavior that would get them in trouble in a different environment, and often have long-set grievances that may have nothing to do with the academic environment directly (e.g., their now-deceased parents didn't respect them enough) but somehow get expressed well in it.

My own experience is that among professors there is a fair percentage of unchecked narcissists. I don't know if the absolute percentage of narcissists is higher than baseline (I could imagine why the academic selection system would favor narcissists, but this is just a pet theory), but I do think that they are more unchecked than you'd get at a lot of places. Even without tenure there is a high tolerance of awful behavior towards colleagues if your research is good, and certainly tenure can insulate people. I suspect you also get knock-off effects by what gets normalized at the ""top"" of fields and institutions; it is clear that some disciplines consider being nasty and aggressive to be a sign of ""brilliance"" and it is rewarded rather than shunned. 

I don't particularly think it is about there being too much competition or too little resources. My sense is that academia could be pretty toxic even before those kinds of conditions existed. The most toxic places I have seen have been those that are very close to the ""top,"" where resources are relatively abundant and nobody is competing in a serious way anymore.

To put it another way, in my experience, competition does lead to anxiety and that obviously can lead to some minor bad behavior and resentment. Certainly people who are actively on the job market and stressed about it can be ungenerous and difficult to be around, especially if they see their immediate peers doing well. I certainly was; I tried to just isolate myself from others when I felt particularly gloomy, because I had seen how some good colleagues who had a few months in which they temporarily unbearable when they were in that situation, but then they came out of it when they got a better sense of what their future might look like, even if it was just temporary (it's the uncertainty that is the anxiety-producer, that lack of control). But that kind of anxiety is not what I associate with ""toxicity"" — the toxic people are the people who have the solid jobs already, in my experience, but are bitter about the institution (for reasons justified or not), their colleagues (ditto), or their unattained goals (which may or may not be reasonable). More importantly, they are enabled to act on this bitterness, because their behavior is essentially unchecked.

I would just note that this is one of those ""be the change you want in the world"" sorts of situations as well. I try to do a lot to be non-toxic, to be the very opposite of it. In some departments, the toxicity is just the defining aspect of it, and it self-perpetuates in terms of who they hire and how they act, but in some the toxicity can be isolated and minimized. Cultures can change, though. I have been sometimes impressed by the power of small attempts to improve things — even with regards to the toxic people themselves, who are used to their toxicity being reflected back at them in some way, and are sometimes quite disarmed by unexpected kindness as a result (your mileage may vary)."
23,AskAcademia,The university that I teach at (NYU) has gone remote because of the coronivirus. I teach two classes of over 100 students and give multiple choice exams. Is there any possible way to stop them from cheating on the exams?,"You can't stop it but you can minimize it. Assuming you will offer exams on your LMS (e.g. Blackboard):

1. Set the time for the exam in such way that it is 35-45 seconds per question. This makes it harder to Google or look up the answers. Advanced: Google your questions to make sure the answers are not readily available. If they are, restructure the question.
2. Make questions appear one at a time (not the entire exam). This makes it harder for one student to print out the exam and have others work on it.
3. Randomize the order of how questions appear so there is no way to create a solutions key with question numbers.
4. Make the exam available only at the same time as the on-campus exam time so everyone takes it at the same time.
5. Do not provide the correct answers or the student score immediately, you can release those after everyone has taken the exam.

Hope this helps, good luck!"
24,AskAcademia,Consequences for plagiarism by professors?,"OP while I agree with everyone who's saying to report this, I'm assuming you're still taking this course. Wait for the semester to end, and for your grade to be locked in. I'm saying this because it's entirely possible for the professor to retaliate to a complaint. And while you could potentially get that sorted out, there's no guarantees of that and it's still a sword hanging over your head. Meanwhile if you report after your grade is locked in (and if you aren't taking any more courses with this Prof) then he can't exactly do much directly to you.

So while you should definitely report this, my advice would be to keep it quiet for a little while until you've completed the semester. Also definitely don't gossip about this. If your professor finds out, they could start thinking of ways to discredit you before you report. The system is geared to give greater weight to the instructor complaining about a student than the other way round."
25,AskAcademia,How can we ethically justify training graduate students?,"This is a very serious question and I don't think it has an easy answer. 

I think that in the short term, mentors can aim to provide PhD students better salaries and stability during their time so at least when viewed as a 4-to-6-year job, it isn't a completely unreasonable one. Practically this might mean not taking students unless you can guarantee good, ample, stable funding, health insurance, vacation time, etc for them. 

I think that some European institutions have done good work in this direction.

In the long term, I don't know what kind of reforms are needed."
26,AskAcademia,Paper editorially rejected by 5 lower-impact journals and accepted in a high-impact journal: What to take away here?,"Your story reminds me why we [ shouldn't use the impact factor of a journal to assess the quality of a publication](https://sfdora.org/read/). Not to say that there's anything bad about your paper, but editorial decisions are so biased and idiosyncratic that it's hard to know how good a paper is until you read it."
27,AskAcademia,Serious question - do admins really think people are excited to read their regular 20 paragraph emails?,"Slight modification:

> Serious question - do admins really think people ~~are excited to~~ read their regular 20 paragraph emails?"
28,AskAcademia,What do academics in humanities and social sciences wish their colleagues in STEM knew?,"I’m in physics (obviously STEM), and there is a funny thing that happens where established physicists get kind  of bored with their discipline and all of a sudden start becoming self-proclaimed experts in psychology / philosophy / history / linguistics. It seems that when people are really good at one thing, they often overestimate their abilities at everything else. PhD students do this too to some extent."
29,AskAcademia,How stop seeing my professors as parental figures?,">I'm in therapy but progress is so slow

Keep at it. Address your concerns (e.g. about the rate of progress) with your therapist."
30,AskAcademia,Is it emotionally valid to steer away from academia due to its lack of empathy and compassion?,"Just to be clear OP, the grass isn't greener on the other side. Institutions (public, corporate) are not human. Humans are humans and so prepared to be disappointed. My recommendation would be to search for people who are empathetic."
31,AskAcademia,Anyone else depressed about defending their thesis online because of COVID?,"I was in the same boat as you, but I actually loved defending my thesis online. There were like 60 people watching the stream, and I had relatives and friends watching that wouldn’t have been able to otherwise. You’ll be able to celebrate with your friends and family in person next year, and you have a job lined up which is awesome. Just be proud of your accomplishment, and make sure you practice your talk beforehand to get used to the format. When I did my presentation, I just got into a nice zone of focusing in on my slides and talk and not worrying about the audience. Anyways, at least in our department, most people end up scuttling off to their meetings and to do work afterwards anyways, and we just have an awkward celebration after."
32,AskAcademia,Any thoughts on the UC academic workers' strike?,I’m tired of all my friends being homeless so
33,AskAcademia,Why are American public universities run like businesses?,"Money, dude. It's money."
34,AskAcademia,Just got my PhD. Now what?,"Don’t try to find meaning in your work, find meaning in your life. Find something that pays well enough with a better work-life balance…for me this year it meant going from a post doc to a government job."
35,AskAcademia,Why do professors feel the need to tell students they aren't cut out for certain careers or them to pursue something else?,"Professors have this weird role (and, yes, I think weird is the right adjective) with regards to undergraduates and career and academic advice. On one hand, professors should be nurturing and always encouraging (almost like a good parent or academic advisor). On the other hand, professors should also be able to treat their students as adults and be able to be honest about potential career and academic prospects. The latter is especially relevant because professors are *very* cognizant how difficult the job market is, especially the academic and non-profit job markets.

I guess my question for you is: why do you want to pursue this particular minor? If you're doing it for your own self-edification, that's great! There should be no downside to it at all. Chalk it off as a flippant remark. 

But if you're trying to make a career out of your major/minor combination, then do realize that this professor is trying to warn you about the difficult road ahead. Unless your professor is a **real** curmudgeon, I am sure they did not mean ill will towards you and was trying to be helpful. 

That being said, I find most successful people I know have a habit of ignoring what other people evaluate their aptitudes and abilities to be but this is, of course, a self-selecting group."
36,AskAcademia,"There are so many people complaining about academia, being overworked and underpaid, not having work-life balance,... Why do people actually want to work in academia?","Departmental culture has a loooot to do with it. I'm at an R1. It's hard. I work hard. I'm 50/50 research/teaching and I looove my job. 

I love the flexibility, creative freedom, and interactions with students. I couldn't imagine myself doing any other job. 

I am 9 mo. I think the 9 mo pay is the most clever guise to get 12 mo out of someone while paying only 9 (pretenure). Many studies can't just stop over the summer. I can't quit turning around r&rs just because I'm not getting a paycheck, lest my chances at publications suffer.  

It's a tradeoff. I work my tail off, but I also can leave work whenever needed to get doctor's appointments, take a quick mental health walk, visit with a friend over lunch, etc. as long as it doesn't conflict with meetings or class. 

I guess like any other job... you've got to love what you do. That being said, I don't eat/sleep/breathe my job. I did the first two years (TT fear of tenure is REAL) but I've learned that I can't keep up that pace and stay sane. 

I enjoyed grad school too though. I feel like my job js like my PhD on steroids with more authority and a better paycheck. 

The politics suck. I won't lie. I hate hate hate them, but most (all?) jobs come with shitty politics."
37,AskAcademia,my name sounds like a racial slur will it affect my academic experience?,"I've chaired several hiring committees during my career (I'm in the US) and the only thing I might do differently with regard to your name is ask you for clarification on how to pronounce it and then practice it a several times before introducing you during your job talk. I looked up the pronunciation and I don't think it's close enough to cause you any trouble. If it was very similar to the slur then it might be worth using a nickname (I wouldn't legally change your name or anything that drastic). But again, I don't think it's close enough to be an issue. it's a nice name!"
38,AskAcademia,Gift Ideas for PhD Care Package?,"Wow you are the nicest person ever! How thoughtful. 

Maybe something that will help encourage them to go outside and get fresh air/exercise even when they have a ton of work to do. You could also write a note for each week or month or something for them to open up and read on a regular basis to keep them motivated and positive!"
39,AskAcademia,How to tell a struggling PhD student who wants to stay in academia that it's time to look for other jobs?,"Research scientist is a legit academic career, but it is not TT. In the absence of a post-doc, they should be applying for these positions."
40,AskAcademia,Is there any talk of scaling back PhD programs in light of the higher ed bubble collapsing/demographic cliff?,"I hope to see them start saying the quiet part out loud: most grads never go into academia, and it's been that case for some time.

And programs start putting far more focus on helping students build pathways via the translatable skills they acquire."
41,AskAcademia,E-mail sign-off rude?,"Ignore it. Like the majority of petty nonsense bullshit in academia.

Take Care,

TerriblePop"
42,AskAcademia,Does anyone else feel traumatized by their academic experience?,"I didn't have such strong negative feelings about my Bachelor's, Masters not even the PhD but now I'm doing my post doc and the atmosphere is terrible and I'm in constant stress."
43,AskAcademia,"People who hire faculty and postdocs, out of the “200 applicants for 1 position” how many were never serious contenders to begin with?","In my experience, it's usually 1/3. We usually have some random people submitting apps, like medical doctors that think they should now be a professor in a completely unrelated field. The next 1/3 is usually missing something big, like pubs or teaching experience. The last 1/3 are where most of the attention is focused, and the difference between those applicants is usually quite nuanced."
44,AskAcademia,The examiner was surprisingly ... cruel to me during my thesis defense?,You passed. The examiner was a dick. Forget them. You passed. Celebrate and don't let them undermine your success. Congrads.
45,AskAcademia,How do I tell my friend that they can't tell people they've published in Nature?,"I've heard people say they've published in ""Nature"" when they've actually only published in Sci Reports many times (and Sci Reports is a notorious rag for my field). *shrug* Yes it does look bad and it makes them look bad, but if you've already bluntly told them that then there's not really much more you can do."
46,AskAcademia,Why am I slacking off days even in my post-PhD life?,"""other 30 year olds in other fields working their ass of 10 -12hours a day for a living, with a serious work ethic""

This is an unrealistic expectation of work ethic. 

Academia sets us up for outrageous burnout. The fact that you are 'cycling' in your ability to focus is actually a symptom of chronic burnout. 

I have moved from academia to industry, and am noticing a stark difference in the way people protect their off-work time. I work 7.5 hours a day, monday to friday, no more, no less (and if more,  claim overtime) and am far more effective day after day than I was in academia pulling 12-16 hr days. 

As is a constant theme in these subreddits and I'm sure you know - A lot of aspects of academia are extremely toxic. I think a way to 'turn it around' is to realize that the expectations are unreasonable and that it's okay if it doesn't work for you. Work for a few isolated hours a day. Build those up if you can. If you can't but are still productive, that's fine. Lower the bar to something reasonable for you, because you are your own worst critic."
47,AskAcademia,Just saw that the research paper I have been working on for a year is published by someone else. Whats should I do?,You should talk to your university's legal department. They might be able to help.
48,AskAcademia,UPDATE: LWIFU. How did I recover?,Now you know why that higher higher up has that job.  Be sure to send him a nice note of thanks.  And don’t be embarrassed to reach out for help.  Good people help each other in times of need.
49,AskAcademia,Misled about funding. What now?,"That really sucks.  I'm sorry that you were put in that position.  If you cannot transfer, it sounds like quitting and getting a job where you can support your family might be the best bet. 

You could totally escalate it to the dean, but what do you expect to come from that? They never promised you something in writing, so although what they did was gross, they did not do anything illegal.  It is hard to see anyone higher up doing anything for you.  If you think it will be cathartic to go through the process of escalating despite the expected outcome, then go for it.  But if you want to focus on your exit plan, then you might want to do just that."
50,AskAcademia,What are some websites every researcher should know?,Connectedpapers
51,AskAcademia,Why has college become so expensive over the last 40 years?,"1. Steadily less state funding in UK and US
2. Ever-increasing administrative strata
3. Increased pay and benefits for executive class
4. Massive infrastructure investment to attract and accommodate ever-increasing intake"
52,AskAcademia,do people really read all the papers they cite?,"Looking at papers that cite mine, there are many where it’s clear they have only read the title and misinterpreted it."
53,AskAcademia,Why are academics paid so little?,"Idealism and only indirect commercial value, similar problem as nurses and teachers. You're not making massive profits for some corporation and you're (too) likely to stick around at a low-paying job with quite possibly (lots of variation - some people have cushy positions) bad conditions for emotional, psychological reasons."
54,AskAcademia,Off the Clock: Should I Have Told my Uber Driver he was Wrong?,"I would have spent my time on my cell phone, occasionally going, ""mmmm."""
55,AskAcademia,Should I Speak up About Homophobia in Research Center?,"I am an older lesbian working in higher education admin.  Here's my take:its not you responsibility to tank your life o er this situation. Survival is key.

If it were me, I would probably tough it out while building a case to submit to the institution and government agency after I left. I mean daily documentation of dates and times and actors and passive observers of each incident  in the notes in my phone that I would transcribe to a document.

Then the hot second I either found a better environment or finished and left off it would go to both of those entities. I'd also find out how to get representation through the aclu and or glaad  or whomever. Then I'd go on about my damn life and let those folks Duke it out. At that point you have essentially provided a dossier and insulated yourself from repercussion.

But again. You are under no obligation to take any action which threatens your safety or well being if it goes against who you are to do so."
56,AskAcademia,During my PhD study I had supervised a Masters Student. I have doubts regarding the validity of his data - on one of his graphs I am confident it is not possible to get the result he described. I asked for raw data but he stated his USB was stolen. Was I wrong not to pursue it any further?,"Your name is on it as an author. A second author directly after this student, nonetheless. I worry that it will seem like you are benefiting from this. If you have doubts about the validity of the data (and don’t want to mention this issue to the other authors), I would suggest trying to get your name off of it.

Edit: As others have mentioned. You don’t have to accuse anyone of wrongdoing. Just say you’re not comfortable publishing it under your name since the data aren’t available for reanalysis."
57,AskAcademia,A paper that took me 3 years to write just got rejected by a journal after 9 months of review. Should I spend another few years trying to improve the paper or move on with my life?,"There's no reason you can't just submit this manuscript with light revisions to a different journal. But let's just zoom out for a minute, because it sounds like your question is about more than a paper manuscript. 

You want your research to matter, and to contribute to science more broadly. Just to state the obvious, publishing a paper isn't a measure of your life's worth. 

Honestly, getting a PhD while working full-time just so you can finish an article is a terrible idea. Just as I understand it, a PhD in computer science is mainly for people professionally going into academia (they want to become a CS/CE/etc. professor). I'd only get a PhD if it advances your career. If it doesn't, and you want to contribute to science, could you do that within your current job, or find a new position?"
58,AskAcademia,I don't give a sh*t about my thesis anymore because I'm likely terminally ill - advice?,"I’ve officially had six months left to live for the better part of a decade, due to illness. My advice: 

You’re on here, posting about it, so you obviously want to get it completed. 

It sounds like your medical issue is compounded by burnout. (Which is not only common, but more than reasonable.) Find someone to talk with about it. Gradschool is a precarious position for mental health in its own right, and staring down this kind of news is the same. They multiply each other. You may need to go through a few counselors before finding a fit that works.  

Then, take a weekend to sit down. Make a list of what your priorities really are. Dedicate your remaining life to attacking them, in order. 

Also, remember that even the ghastly sorts of diagnosis (mine…) sometimes pan out unexpectedly. A bit more than ten years ago, I was in a coma, after my brain was cooked and bashed in. When I woke up, the use of whole sentences was a goal. A few years later, looking at my scans, the top researchers of the world agreed that I’d be dead soon. Being alive and functional today was impossible, but happened."
59,AskAcademia,PhD boyfriend has no time for me. What do I do?,"Yeah, no. Academia is a time suck and will suck as much time out of you as possible if you let it but that's the key, if you let it. Either this guys is interested enough to make time for you or he's not that interested. Draw the line where you would in any other relationship. If he's like this only 2 months in its not going to get better."
60,AskAcademia,I have manipulated data in my research paper and it is killing me from inside. What should I do?,"> I honestly had no intent of deceiving anyone, I didn't realize it at all at that time and it was out of my inexperience 

You are kinda saying two things: On the one hand you did it unknowingly (the only way if you didn't intend to deceive anyone); while on the other hand you call it ""data-manipulation"" and unethical, which would be very much intentionally deceiving people. 

If it was because you mis-understood the methods, or your data analysis was flawed, then you have nothing much to fear. You were an undergrad and were still learning how to do research; so mistakes do happen - which is one of the reasons it's unusual that an undergraduate paper get's all the way to publication. If you go to your advisor and say ""in hindsight, and with more experience, I think this and this is wrong"" you should be absolutely fine - much better to find this now instead of during the peer review process. 

If you intentionally changed your data then I can't help you."
61,AskAcademia,Is it OK to email the author of a journal article to ask for the article?,People asking for PDFs articles of mine makes my day - it's honestly the opposite of rude but do be patient. You'll either get a reply immediately or in three weeks.
62,AskAcademia,Reviewing the n-th paper about an overdone topic. What should I say?,"This reminds me of [this](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.9b00184) beautiful article titled ""Will Any Crap We Put into Graphene Increase Its Electrocatalytic Effect?"". I do not want to spoil the fun read."
63,AskAcademia,I feel obliterated. Will I pass my PhD? Should I even bother?,"That is a shit situation.  You were assaulted and harassed by the person you relied on while you were in vulnerable position.  It's no wonder you feel worthless now.

You need to devise a realistic plan for graduating.  Find someone--a dean, a professor, an ombudsman--who you trust and who understands the situation.  Work with them to find out what your options are.  There may be possibilities you haven't thought of.

Also, start seeing a therapist.  The panic attack you describe sounds a lot like ptsd.  You will not be able to do your best work without dealing with it.  And you can deal with it.  It will get better with therapy.

You are not stupid or worthless.  Your writing is clear.  You're in a really hard place right now, but you have reason to be hopeful.  You can be hopeful because you have resources available to you that can lead you out of this situation.  The most important of those resources is your own ability.  Your ability to perform in your field and your ability to find support from the people around you."
64,AskAcademia,What are some uncomfortable truths in academia?,Your PhD advisor can make or break your academic career. If you get roped in by a bad one you're done before you even begin.
65,AskAcademia,Would it be weird to send an email to a professor who's book I loved?,This isn't weird—it's a rare academic author who wouldn't be delighted to receive such an email. Consider describing what aspect of their style or content you especially enjoyed. Don't feel bad if you don't hear back. It's also a rare academic author who devotes much time for correspondence.
66,AskAcademia,By this time next year I plan to resign from my TT position and relocate back to my hometown. I'm embarking on a new career path in search of newer opportunities that don't place me in a position of severe economic impoverishment and overwork. How do I resign without sabotaging my reputation?,"Don't over think it. I was in a similar position, knowing for almost a year that I was going to leave. You can avoid most long term commitments if you just tell people that your plate is too full to take on new projects. You don't owe the department anything beyond professional courtesy - that means do your best to ensure a smooth transition of your responsibilities. But the will be loose ends, and that's just the nature of leaving a job.

Regarding your resignation, all you need to do is give them the amount of notice your contract specifies, and your resignation letter just needs to say that you're leaving to pursue other opportunities. It's a formality, not a chance to express your feelings."
67,AskAcademia,"How did universities do hiring, promotion, and tenure before “publish or perish”?","I've heard one senior faculty at a top school brag he's never had to apply to a single job in his life. Back in his day, he was just recommended to jobs by his seniors, who were extremely respected scientists"
68,AskAcademia,Friend outsourced her thesis portfolio for MFA. Should I keep quiet?,You're worried about her academic career? It's not even hers.
69,AskAcademia,"I’m a fourth-semester PhD student, and my advisor passed away suddenly on Sunday less than two months before I’m due to defend my thesis proposal. What now?","I'm so sorry you've lost your friend and mentor. For the practical stuff like the grant, ask the director of your grad program to get into the funding issue."
70,AskAcademia,How to talk to a grad student about productivity issues?,"Setting up tasks and keeping an eye on the progress is totally fair, just make sure that you realistically estimate the time those tasks need. Sorting out a package installation can take the whole day. Fixing convergence issues can take a week. On top of that, everything takes \*much\* longer for a student who is doing this for the first time. Maybe you should first see if she is actually putting in approximately a full time's worth of work, or if it's a motivation problem."
71,AskAcademia,Anyone Else Sick of Shitty Online Applications?,"I applied to a job at Princeton (which I won't get, but hey). The application website is one page. No login or account. Just put in name and email info; upload the cover letter, CV, and work sample; write down the names and emails of references; and check the various demographic boxes. Couldn't have taken more than five minutes. 

It really made me appreciate just how bad every other one of these is. Particularly CUNY's. CUNY's is terrible."
72,AskAcademia,Is it ever okay to exclude a co-supervisor from a PhD thesis acknowledgments?,"I was in a similar situation where I struggled/laughed with the absurdity of thanking one of my advisors. I searched long and hard and surprisingly came up with a genuine acknowledgment of things he did that I benefited from. If there's any chance at all that you can do this--and you may have to go really far back--I'd recommend it. 

In academia, knowing how to be diplomatic despite your displeasure/boredom/rage is a core skill. I'd look at this as an opportunity to hone that. What could be more challenging for you, right now, at this stage? It will be great to cut your teeth on. Good luck!"
73,AskAcademia,Is it even realistic/feasible to become a professor anymore?,"If your goal is to be a research professor at a R01 then it is a long and arduous journey. If you prefer teaching, then smaller schools that emphasize teaching are less competitive. Many open positions will even allow applications to professor positions from ABD (all but dissertation) grad students.

The catch-22 of this is that teaching is not part of your dissertation so it doesn't help you graduate. Me and a friend in my cohort both were teaching four classes a semester while working on our dissertations and we both were able to go straight to assistant professor positions at smaller schools after graduating. 

If you have any follow up questions, I am happy to help."
74,AskAcademia,Why do academics seem to loath their profession?,"The thing that gnawed on my advisor was that If he had a losing streak on grants for a few years where he was ONLY in the top 85 percent and not top 90 percent, he would have to fire his staff and destroy the career trajectory of his students and postdocs.  And it would be his fault for failing to run a successful lab."
75,AskAcademia,Why does it seem that students who have a science background or are more science-minded tend to do quite well in arts subjects but not vice versa?,"I think part of it is the prerequisite knowledge. For an introductory college humanities class, you need to be able to read, write, and think critically. For even a remedial math class, you need all of the above plus all the math you’ve learned up to that point. Someone who is good at math already has the skills to do well in other fields. They just have to learn domain-specific information. 

Regardless of your major, everyone will show up to an intro philosophy class with almost no philosophy background. You can’t show up to a calculus class with good critical thinking skills and no math knowledge expecting it to go well. 

The cumulative nature of math also explains the existence of courses like “calculus for social sciences”. A standard calculus track is teaching you some math you’ll use in your field but also preparing you for more math which is usually the hardest part. If someone doesn’t need more math, they’re better off just learning what they’ll actually need."
76,AskAcademia,Does anyone else feel like they aren't doing enough towards their PhD?,I think you’ve hit the nail on the head with the fact that you can work from home. Lab based students have to fit all their reading etc in around time in the lab so that gives you more undirected hours. Is there any writing you can start on now that will save you time at the end? Like a draft literature review or methods chapter. It will need updating before your submit but could be something to get on with while you have spare time.
77,AskAcademia,Am I the only one who can't see how physical distancing is feasible in classrooms?,"Last week I spent Monday morning planning out a seminar for my class in September. We're doing hybrid teaching, so we're going to have one cohort who's taking the class online and half (if we're lucky) who are actually in the building. So, I'm planning the class and I want to have them interview each other to identify an entrepreneurial opportunity and then reflect on how they observed it. 

Online, as you say, it's easy enough. Breakout rooms, shared whiteboards, easy peasy. 

But then I realised I Can't Do That In Person. 2 meters distance! I'm in Scotland so the guidance is ""leave room for a hairy coo"". How are we supposed to have in-person seminars people need to shout at each other from across the room to think, pair, share? 

Frankly, I think the underlying assumption to any in-person teaching plans is that by September we're going to ignore a lot of social distancing guidelines. Either formally as the regulations get changed or informally because that's just the way things have to be for it to work. There is no solution for making teaching work in a Covid world. We're just pretending there is in order to preserve some sense of normality and ensure there is some sort of teaching income."
78,AskAcademia,My advisor was sexually inappropriate - how can I get around a letter of recommendation from him for PhD applications?,"Advice/commentary I got from a professor on the graduate committee at my university. If you don't have a letter of recommendation from you undergrad thesis supervisor it will raise questions, but if you tell them why it won't be an issue. He had some applicants in similar boats, one he mentioned had turned in their advisor for fraudulent data in their research, and if there is a good reason then it won't be an issue. You just need to get 3 letters for must universities so you'll need to find someone else to write one."
79,AskAcademia,TIFU. How do I recover?,"Wait, so they expected you to just eat it on the expenses you had already paid for to attend the conference?"
80,AskAcademia,Is it Inappropriate to Attend Thesis Defenses as an Undergraduate?,"not inappropriate at all, at least not in my experience. But you're discovering a common truth about thesis defenses: nobody goes to them, haha. Its one of the most difficult things to digest as a PhD student that what you've just spent years of your life absolutely pouring yourself into, is probably not going to draw in more than a handful of audience members. This goes for academic conferences, too: i've spent months preparing for a conference talk that maybe 7 people ended up actually attending, lol. Just kind of a fact of the job ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

I attended one of my good friends' defenses the other day--she's not my friend from school and i have no real familiarity with her STEM-related field (i'm in English), but because shes in a pretty flashy, well-funded area of STEM i expected a healthy attendance. I was the only person there outside of her dissertation committee, even though like you've said it was a completely open invitation to anyone affiliated with this person/school."
81,AskAcademia,My publication was entirely plagerized in another journal. What are next steps?,Thank you all for the replies. It seems this Longdom journal is a predatory journal and has done this before. I will reach out to Elsevier who own the copyright to my article and to warn them about this fraud author.
82,AskAcademia,I'm getting controversial advice: Is the publishing process really racist or are my advisors tripping?,">I hate my parents for not changing my name when I was 1 year old

This is unrelated, but you can still change your name as an adult if you hate it."
83,AskAcademia,Dating struggles as an older phd student...to date or not to date?,"You're not faculty, so I see no issue."
84,AskAcademia,Fired?,"In this situation, it might really be something for you to talk to with a lawyer before making any decisions / signing anything; especially the part where it sounds like someone demonstrably lied about you and you have proof.

\>  I asked him if he saw changing me to another project as an option (so  basically me not working with the other supervisor). He told me that he  does not see it as an option because ""that is too easy and you have to  learn to work with different kind of people"", which is kind of true (i  guess). 

This is very unfair and kind of cheap - there are vast differences in people and in the ability to deal with them given power relationships and resources, and a bad PhD supervisor isn't necessarily someone you can ""learn to work with"". I wonder whether there might not be more wriggle room here if it really comes to it, but you might need to bring in someone else with more authority. Possibly the university has some kind of ombudsman or grad student director to talk to and get involved before actually mentioning a lawyer (which is the nuclear and high-risk option of course - but you can talk to one without telling them).

\> Just to be clear during the interviews I was only told ""you will have to work with organs and biological samples"". 

This also seems like quite a serious issue, if you took the job and made all the associated arrangements based on a misleading job description.

Wish the best in any case - something will work out and things might be a blessing in disguise, you never know. But I'd really mainly get that advice and support if at all possible so they can't bully you in the shadows so easily at least. And keep your own notes in any case, and maybe recordings (you might have to tell them you're making your own if they are, depending on local laws)."
85,AskAcademia,Really embarrassed after being denied an extension... Don't know how to stay on my professor's good graces?,"You don't owe the professor anything.  It's not disrespectful to ask when you have genuine need, as you clearly do. 

I missed a major course deadline in the first year of my PhD due to mental health issues and ended up with a C in the course; the instructor let me do \[a significant quantity of\] make-up work afterwards to get it into the B range. (I was thinking about fellowship apps, but if you aren't looking to apply for another degree or fellowship, it probably isn't worth the extra work for you and for the instructor.)  

But – if you find your grade is significantly impacted by this assignment and you have concerns about it for future goals, it may be worth reaching out with a little more info (you were caring for your sick grandparents) and asking whether there is other work you could do to make it up afterwards."
86,AskAcademia,Why are US faculty job applications so tedious?,It's a test. U.S. universities need to make sure you are prepared to handle a future full of bureaucracy and tedious paperwork.
87,AskAcademia,Should I make a Google Scholar account?,I like counting the citations as they come in. It's fun.
88,AskAcademia,Should I have to edit my PhD students dissertation for basic grammar?,Does your university have a writing center? They can make a few appointments for grammar help.
89,AskAcademia,Why are scientists always portrayed as bad guys/cowardly villains/arrogant/etc in movies/media?,Or how scientists act completely unscientific. Remember Prometheus? Most unbelievable scientific characters I can think of.
90,AskAcademia,Is it appropriate to email a professor asking for a digital copy of their article?,Yes. You should feel free to send this kind of e-mail. Professors don't make money off of their journal articles and they want people to read their work so they should normally be happy to send them to people. 
91,AskAcademia,What’s life like Post-PhD? Does one feels less dumb?,"No it’s great. On days when I’m lounging around being a useless lump, I catch myself and I’m like “damn I’m a doctor!” And then I feel fancy and validated as I uselessly lump around."
92,AskAcademia,Prospective Grad student- what are good questions to ask the current students of a prospective advisor?,"""Are you happy?"""
93,AskAcademia,Research Funding is the worst thing about academia. How to make academia more financially secure?,"Yeah the funding is the pits. I’m a fifth year PI running on fumes, and myself and all my peers are talking to each other about how we’re going to make graceful exits from this horrible career path we’re on… whether by choice or otherwise."
94,AskAcademia,I’m suicidal should I tell my PI?,"There is only one right answer to this.

You should immediately get mental health crisis counseling and that qualified, trained person should advise you based on your specific circumstances and diagnosis how to safely proceed.

Any other random person on reddit who thinks that 2 lines is enough to give someone not only good advice, but advice that may not cause more harm than good is delusional at best."
95,AskAcademia,Grad students making our plan Bs - is there space for people like us in academia?,">is there space in academia anymore for people who want to work reasonable hours (I mean like 9-6 M-F most of the time)?

As I understand it, this \*used\* to be a reasonable option, you just had to lower your expectations from getting a TT job at an R1 to something else: a teaching-focused liberal arts college, community college, etc. 

But, yeah, the academic arms race has gotten so competitive (^(because while jobs have been drying up for YEARS, departments refusing to stop pumping out students. Don't let the easy out of COVID distract you from the fact that this is not a new trend)), that even these jobs are filled with recent PhDs from top10 programs and they have insane productivity expectations if they want tenure. 

So, honestly, I don't think so. I am 100% planning to get out, and I don't view it as a shame by any means. But that's just me, because I also know, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that I \*need\* my life to go back to having a 9-to-5 job where I don't spend 18 hours a day either doing -- or thinking about -- my research. I have too damn many skills and other interests to run on that hamster wheel for any longer than is strictly necessary."
96,AskAcademia,"As a student, should we challenge our textbooks when they contain bullshit and where is the onus for the bullshit?","Who is responsible? All of the above. I explicitly tell my students to question what they are taught, and challenge when they think something doesn’t add up. I point out when I disagree with something in a textbook. You should have been taught to critically think in high school, and you should absolutely be doing that in college. 

The publisher should be fact checking their authors before they publish. As faculty, I try to read all of any book I require or recommend, but I skim some and could miss something even when I read thoroughly."
97,AskAcademia,"What are some obvious issues in academia, nobody wants to talk about?","Expectations that a single academic will do everything - teach, do cutting edge research, manage people, do admin work, write papers, communicate science to general public, service equipment and so on. No support staff, no division of work between people, you need to do everything and be excellent in every aspect."
98,AskAcademia,Found my masters dissertation was plagiarised. Where to go from here?,"Don't ever let someone take credit for your work. A PhD is a title given to those who have earned it through hard work, dedication, and novel insights to their field. If they can't do their own lit review, they don't get a PhD. 

It's a disservice to you, your field and really that person. How long did it take to write that? How long does it take to copy someone else's ideas and words into a document? You deserve recognition for your work. 

Don't email the chair saying this was plagiarized. send both documents,, direct the chair to the plagiarized parts, say you've noticed many similarities and ask him to come to his own conclusions."
99,AskAcademia,Can we explicitly state that some statement is about American academia when it is exclusively about American academia?,I feel like all posts should explain the location and region just because each area is very different.
100,AskAcademia,Is it wrong that I feel resentful towards my PI making me work on a weekends/university holiday (MLK day) and that he was unappreciative of it?,"My advisor was similar and I still resent her for some things to this day. Just submit it and then take the next day off in lieu of not taking off MLK day. My advisor often had me working during Christmas, so I would just take random days off during the semester to compensate for it. My advice to you is to not look at their perceived ""disappointment"" as a failure, and realize that they're probably an asshole and will mostly likely continue to be an asshole regardless of when you get it done."
101,AskAcademia,Why are all geology professors so nice?,"In order to be a geologist, you have to be a gneiss person, have no faults, and be out standing in the field."
102,AskAcademia,Why are some US grad students on food stamps?,"Funding levels differ dramatically; at some institutions they are adequate to support a grad student, and possibly even minimally support children of a grad student, but at other institutions the pay is absurdly low. It's a real mess and (imo) a disgrace on academia."
103,AskAcademia,For Ph.D. students that used to work out consistently during college. Is it possible to do it during a Ph.D.?,Yes. And you should. You will do better in the your Ph.D. program if you keep it up.
104,AskAcademia,My PhD is R&D for my profs start-up?,"Hi, I'm a postdoc working on a project that is being commercialized by my advisor's startup. My postdoc is academic with public funding sources routed through the university.  The startup is privately funded.  I knew about the startup before I came on board because I was a potential future hire, and have since joined the startup as a consultant-- but before I joined the project there was a strict separation of information between me in the postdoc and the startup team using our work in commercial applications. This wall was specifically put up to prevent conflicts of interest. 

When I joined the startup, I worked with my university on a coi plan and advising contract to make sure that my postdoc time was not overridden by the startup. Some, but not most, universities have policies in place to protect grad students, postdocs, and technicians from potential conflicts with their supervisor's startups. You can check with your postdoc office on this.

In general, startups are usually pretty secretive in the early stages until funding is secure and the hiring team is expanding. It is not surprising that you didn't know about it.  It is also not surprising that you have no stake in this-- your advisor and their company, and maybe the university, own the IP here.

EDIT: I'll add another note here. Before my postdoc, I did my PhD on the development of an oceanographic sensor. I was essentially the only one with hands on this sensor for 5.5 years and had made many leaps in the design. The sensor was an improvement on an earlier version for which my advisor had a patent, which was filed through his institution.

With that in mind, I published my thesis describing my work on the sensor, and will shortly be publishing a paper on that. But I don't own any IP here-- it's owned by the university/institution and my advisor. If he filed for an updated patent that explicitly used something I came up with, I may be eligible to be a co-author and would be at least credited in the description. But if he decided to build a startup to commercialize this sensor? I would have no claim to it, even though I built the thing. That's the nature of university relationships around IP-- I signed documents at the beginning of my PhD program acknowledging the IP was owned by my employer. To keep a good collaborative environment it is likely I could strike a deal with my advisor/ institution for licensing or purchasing these sensors at reduced costs, but I would not expect more than that. I think this is really important for students and early career academics to understand-- you probably don't own much of anything you ever work on in a university, and even less if you build something with external funding."
105,AskAcademia,Is it common to fail to get a PhD after 10 years of being in the program?,Common? No. Unheard of? Also no.
106,AskAcademia,My undergraduate students suck at writing essays. How do I even grade them fairly?,"Rubrics. Clear, overly detailed, consistently used rubrics.

Edit: OP, I should also note that I am currently grading assignments for our Media Writing course (so inverted pyramid style, as opposed to what they're taught in English courses). And I'm on my second 24 oz. glass of 12% beer. It doesn't improve their writing, but it does improve my ability to cope with it. Highly recommend."
107,AskAcademia,Should social ethics be a required curriculum component for scientists/pre-health professionals?,"I'd like to see some sources for the ""most professors believe..."" section of your post, since I have not heard a single colleague espouse that view over my time at multiple institutions. 

In fact, most of us think it's a critical component of the curriculum...."
108,AskAcademia,Academia is toxic. Why?,"I am very disillusioned and bitter about my current job search so I will just comment on the PhD environment. 

When I first started, i was thinking people will be friendly and I would just find my fellow nerds super enthusiastic about our common area. In reality, especially in big departments with lots of competition, you will come across toxic people. My department is famous for being toxic, maybe 30% of the people were normal and the rest was just extremely gossipy, competitive and aggressive. They say one thing, do something completely different in front of professors, steal ideas, compete for and try to take over any teaching, marking or admin duties you might want, try to take all credit for shared projects and conferences. I even know some people that spread rumours about sexual orientation, pregnancy, aids, mental problems about fellow phds, just out of spite.

So how did I survive? Well, I did not. My name is not on three of the conferences I co-organised. I lost 2 different modules because someone told the professor I was too busy to do it so they can do it instead and I only found out after my contract was delayed. Lots of people think I am extremely cold because i kept my distance. Some of them think I am a lesbian. Its not worth tracking the source of that because I don't find it insulting. I am just glad to be done with my PhD.
(Not sure if my comment above reads like I left the phd, i still completed it)"
109,AskAcademia,Leave Academia at 30?,"I just want to advise, you need to stop thinking there is a wrong choice. All of your choices can be good choices, you also have a lot of skills to fall back on. Whatever you do you’ll be fine. I don’t think the human brain is really set up to have so many good choices and it has a tendency to stall people when it happens. I bet you’ll know more about this than me!"
110,AskAcademia,I was offered a PhD position. Would it be weird if I asked to talk to a PhD student I would work with before deciding to accept?,Nope! Not at all. I think that's expected. It's a big commitment. I've done it myself and I've spoke to incoming PhD students.
111,AskAcademia,Is it normal to accomplish effectively nothing in a summer internship?,Absolutely!!!!! I had several internships during which I accomplished fuck all scientifically. The overall experience is what matters.
112,AskAcademia,My university seems to have put zero thought into prepping for me coming to campus (TT)?,"Maybe it depends on the institution, but this sounds exactly like my experience and everyone else in my universities experience (pre-COVID). My office and lab were both unusable (full of asbestos floor tiles that were partially damaged, a non-functioning fume hood, someones sample collection, a leaking sink, etc) when I arrived. My spaces were not prepared until 1.5 years after my arrival (it took 6 months for facilities to schedule me an appointment to talk to me to *start* the bid process), my furniture wasn't procured for another 6 months, so I didn't really ""move in"" to my office until 2 years after the start of my position (so I spent the first 2 years in some random space filled with weird objects collected over the career of an emeritus faculty member who never bothered to clean out his junk). No one asked (and there appeared to be no way) for me to order anything in advance, so my computers didn't show up till about 2-3 months in to my work. There was no training on how to do anything, I basically just showed up at the doorsteps of colleagues like ""Hi, can you explain the procurement/travel/grant management/etc system to me?"" I got one day of training from HR on benefit elections, etc, but nothing about the grant submission system, the payroll system, or really anything else. My startup account is constantly being shifted so the account numbers change, so half the time when I submit a purchase order it gets bounced back because that account number no longer works. So, I guess welcome to academia?

EDIT: Oh, and since desk chairs were mentioned, I had to find a desk chair myself. There was a random semi-functional one in a hallway for a few days, I just stole it when I figured it was just waiting to be surplussed. It was ungodly uncomfortable and I relished putting it back in the hallway 2 years later when my furniture was finally delivered. The chair was gone two days later, the circle of life continues.

EDIT 2: 5 years in I still don't have a whiteboard, because my attempts to order one keeping being declined because it's somehow suppose to be routed through facilities and purchasing, but nobody will tell me how."
113,AskAcademia,Should I contact my previous advisor to see how they are doing?,"Yes, let them know."
114,AskAcademia,Is it fine to email a Professor at a different university to ask about their work?,"I'm a professor and would be happy to receive such an email (if it was polite and informed, of course).  Don't make the ask very big (as profs don't have much time).  Also, don't ask for something that you could find for yourself through searching your library database or Google. 

I have done this several times when I was a student and will let you know that maybe only 1 or 2 replied."
115,AskAcademia,My PI is asking me to falsify data. What is my recourse?,"Before you report anything, I would advise that you very carefully think through what exactly was said and asked of you. 

If you were specifically and explicitly asked to falsify anything, then yes, immediately report it and forward any and all information to the appropriate people. 

But... most PIs are smarter than this, and to be fair, a lot of papers and grant applications sadly attempt to work in a grey zone that blurs the line between rigorous science and salesmanship. For the sake of academic survival, many researchers try to forge a very positive and optimistic interpretation of what the have or plan to achieve. No one will fund you if you fairly disclose that your methods and data are questionable... but this doesn't excuse overselling ""bad"" science. 

It's also important to consider whether the 2nd person in that mtg will side with the PI and claim that you grossly misunderstood the conversation. So I strongly suggest that you follow up with an email or documented conversation that can be read by a 3rd party and objectively conclude that they were asking you to do something clearly
unethical.  

And beware: Universities from any country will always act on blatant law breaking...but when it comes to the grey zone of ethics, they will most often give the PI the benefit of the doubt. As leaders in their own field and research niche, administrators often consider the ""expert"" in deciding what is okay and what is not to be the PI. Unless there is documented evidence, paper trails, or direct proof, I would expect the university to chalk your situation up to a simple miscommunication. 

I encourage you to do the right thing, but also to tread carefully. Consider another serious conversation with the PI and ask for clarification. Make your concerns clear and then decide what to do based on their response. A premature jump to reporting them can do more harm to you than to them, and it could get you ""blacklisted"" in terms of your professional career if this person is truly unethical but able to escape justice. 

Good luck, OP!"
116,AskAcademia,When did the publishing model become so effed up?,Well maybe if we allowed scholarly activities that aren’t published articles to count for tenure then this problem would disappear.
117,AskAcademia,How to deal with students coming to me at the end of the semester to tell me they had mental health issues during the semester and would like some leniency in the grading?,"If I have a student who has not communicated with me throughout the semester and comes to me at the end of the semester to tell me that they have had health issues during the semester that made them under-perform, I assist them with finding the petition for a medical withdraw.

I know some are lying and some genuinely have had issues. Regardless, without communication throughout the semester, I am largely unable to assist them. There is no way to create an action plan for success at the end of the semester.

As you pointed out, it is also helpful to point them to the counseling and medical resources on campus."
118,AskAcademia,Why don't the scientists themselves relay their research to the public?,"In my case, there isn't a large audience for blind beamforming of non-gaussian signals in MIMO systems. And the small audience that enjoys this content reads my journal articles."
119,AskAcademia,"I really enjoyed my course and as it’s ending, is it okay to take a coffee for my professor as I meet him for final office hours?","that’s a very nice gesture, although an email thanking them for the class and explaining what you enjoyed about it would probably be even more appreciated"
120,AskAcademia,“College isn’t for everyone”. Is it really that simple?,"Higher education in a college format doesnt help everyones path. Education and new skills, sure, but my cousin wasted years at college before going to a vocational school and loving his trade. He was miserable in classrooms. Hands on, lecture, asynchronous, doesnt matter. He just wanted to learn to do a job and did."
121,AskAcademia,"No matter what I do, I keep feeling the pull back to higher ed. I'm 28 and will probably apply for a PhD next year but feel like I'm too old and the market is too volatile. Thoughts?","28 definitely isn't too old. As to the volatility of the market, it would help to know your specific field."
122,AskAcademia,Was fired for having a criminal record. Am I barred from academia forever?,"Were you fired for having a criminal record or failing to disclouse the whole truth about your criminal record? (I appreciate that you didn't understand the distinction between the resisting charges, but the rationale for your firing could make a difference). The main reason I ask is I wonder whether the 'violence' is the root of the problem, as I'd be surprised if a university was bothered about a criminal record per se (though I know the UK and US have rather different attitudes), and then 'lying' on an application is usually a sacking offense no matter what the lie actually is."
123,AskAcademia,Is anyone unemployed after PhD?,">Has anyone ever been unable to find a faculty position?

I'm pretty sure this describes the majority of people post PhD."
124,AskAcademia,How do people publish 200+ papers?,"By having a lot of people working under them, and delegating everything but the big ideas."
125,AskAcademia,"Is ""bullshit"" a legitimate research area and is it supposed to be tongue-in-cheek or am I just immature?","Yes, it's a legitimate area of study. Bullshitting is trying to pass off vacuous or epistemically fuzzy content as truth. It involves an intentional state of an actor and a presupposed state of receptivity by an other. The recipient of the claim likely has to engage in some type of reasoning process to accept or reject the bullshit. For these reasons bullshitting is a complex process that may yield insights into how specific operations or processes (such as reasoning or evaluation of a claim) may operate.

Edit: here's an example of a bullshit study in a decent journal http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.html"
126,AskAcademia,Am I still a scientist if I don’t currently hold a job as one?,"> Can I still call myself a scientist on my resume, or am I living a lie?

I would think that ""Scientist"" is a bit too broad of a category to be particularly useful. If you're making a resume/CV, I think it would be better to list your degree and the job title/duties.

Edit to add:

In more informal settings, then yes I'd say call yourself a scientist, based on your education and experience. Even if you aren't actively working on scientific research, you were still trained as a scientist. That, in my view, is what is relevant."
127,AskAcademia,How important was being around campus as a PhD student?,"I have a PhD in psychology (social/personality) and I found that people tended to take notice of who was on campus and who was not. I was able to get involved on a few projects largely because I was around. Then, as people learned I was reliable, I was able to get involved in a lot more collaborations. Some people couldn’t care less if students are around or not, but for those that do care about it, showing up can do a lot for their perception of you. 

As much as networking at conferences was invaluable, I think the networking within my department gave me a good jumping off point for when I networked elsewhere. Academic communities are small and people talk to each other more than you might think. Sometimes impressing a professor in an adjacent field can mean that people at conferences have already heard good things about you.

I also found that being around was helpful whenever I needed another perspective or some help on my work. Sometimes I would explain my reasoning to other grad students just to have them poke holes in it. Overall, I think those perspectives made my thesis stronger and helped prepare me for my defense."
128,AskAcademia,Is the Tenure-Track Job Era Over?,"The jobs are...out there...but I think the direction universities have been going in is definitely one of the gig economy, hiring on a per class basis. That is and will be the case for the majority of people.

Meanwhile, they will hire TT positions for a handful of slots in order to have people around they can advertise to donors and people applying for grad programs. This is already the case.

In short: unless you're a rockstar, it's already over."
129,AskAcademia,My advisor was sexually inappropriate - how can I get around a letter of recommendation from him for PhD applications?,"First of all, sorry about what you've had to go through OP. That's extremely serious and it's unacceptable that the department refuses to acknowledge it. There is no place for sexism in academia/science, period.

Now on to the matter at hand, e-mail your old professors with a document containing your CV/accomplishments and let them know that you are interested in applying to graduate school, maybe add a photo to your email profile so they'll remember you. Worst-case scenario, they toss the email. Best case, you get a LOR. Tbh, the LOR probably will not be as strong since it's not from someone who advised you but it's better than nothing and if you have a good CV the professor can still put in a good word for you.

If anyone asks about your PI during your PhD interview process, I think it's fine to be honest and say that you have broken contact with them due to numerous instances of sexual harassment towards you. If they are understanding, they'll be quick to drop it. If they blacklist you for it, that person was shitty to begin with and you'll probably dodge a few bullets in the long-run."
130,AskAcademia,How can I stay professional and calm while meeting with my toxic Ph.D. supervisor after I've graduated?,"It sounds like you would need to travel to attend? So I would just tell PI I cannot travel at that time, but I appreciate the invitation and wish I could come as he’s a big part of how I got to this point in my career and wish him the best. Something that’s a no, but still makes a narcissist feel good so next time I ask for a favor he has positive feelings"
131,AskAcademia,Reporting departmental abuse?,i dont know wby this is a live chat or how to turn it off
132,AskAcademia,Can I tweet at researcher to ask for a copy of a paper?,"Not sure about tweeting etiquette but...have you tried using scihub? [Current link](https://sci.hubbza.co.za/): it changes from time to time because it's, uhh, a pirating website for scientific papers. It works really well...not that I use it, of course, pirating is something nobody should ever do, especially broke students."
133,AskAcademia,Has anyone had funding stolen? or even heard of that happening?,"If you mean misappropriation of funds or embezzlement it happens. You could try reporting it, but this is the problem in organisations that accept donor funds without proper processes and governance in place. Really the donor and your organisation should be requiring accounts not just pictures that could be from anything and if there's no proper agreement in place then arguably nothing untoward has happened even if morally it's corrupt."
134,AskAcademia,Why aren’t phd students paid more?,"Also NIH grant funding levels have stagnated for decades, so the spending power is continually less than it used to be. Leaves little room to pay grad students more when PIs are having to tighten their belts every year as it is. 

https://drugmonkey.scientopia.org/2020/12/16/updating-the-erosion-of-the-purchase-power-of-the-modular-nih-r01/"
135,AskAcademia,How to start giving more f**ks so that I'm motivated enough to be disciplined?,Discipline is all well and good but the problem is people are often totally unrealistic about what's possible. Don't set yourself a goal of doing 8h. Set yourself a goal of 2h in the morning a long lunch and then maybe 1h in the afternoon. 3h of solid work is so much better than 8h of pissing about. You'll probably find you build up to more.
136,AskAcademia,"Embarrassing question but... what does it mean to ""present a paper, "" exactly?","This differs by field a bit as well.

In our field it's normally oral vs poster presentation, with oral being a talk (with powerpoint slides) that describes a substantial piece of work that either exists as a paper or you intend to publish as a paper."
137,AskAcademia,Is it okay to cold email a professor to ask for a paper that has been accepted for publication but not published yet? And how to word it?,"I’ve done this maybe a dozen times. Most times they sent me the paper happily, sometimes along with other related papers they thought I might enjoy. 

The worst thing that happened was once I didn’t get a response, and another time I was asking about a manuscript for something they weren’t ready to share. 

I can’t imagine a professor being [insert negative emotion] that someone was interested in their work and working with them.

Just send a polite email asking what you want to ask."
138,AskAcademia,Grad student wants to switch advisors b/c his advisor was mocking his religious beliefs. Suggestions as to what I should do?,"I am Jewish, and this sounds both unpleasant and hard to deal with (from your perspective). It seems reasonable to switch advisers if someone else has a compatible research focus."
139,AskAcademia,Do I (“professor”) tell students about my health issues?,"I was/am in a similar boat. During my masters, I also got extremely sick. They thought leukemia, and I did let my professors know but not my students. It turns out I have an autoimmune disease, so will have this my whole life, but am currently doing ok. I will not tell my students unless something absolutely has to be told due to my health, but my faculty know in case of emergencies."
140,AskAcademia,Why is everything so slow at the universities?,"If working with a state institution, often multiple levels of bureaucracy to do with hiring and major purchases (approvals, forms, checks against regulations etc.).  Even *if* the people involved were ultra efficient, it would be slow....when they arent......"
141,AskAcademia,Are Ivy league universities worth it? Do they have that much higher quality education than less famous universities? Does the reputation do justice to these uni's education or the main reason they are famous is because of their history?,"Went to MIT, which isn't a traditional Ivy, but close. Some of the comments are partially right that these schools get access to a much better candidate pools, so even the lower grade students are still pretty good (I was below average there, but got the highest grades in all my PhD classes at a lower ranking university). 


However, this is changing recently. When I got in, back in 2008, acceptance rate was about 16%. And the super bright students usually went to top schools. These days acceptance rates for MIT and other similar schools is about 4%. So many universities are filled with super bright kids (maybe you can distinguish the top 20% of an applicant pool, but after that you might as well setup a lottery to select the top 4%). So I expect the traditional top schools will slowly lose some of their shine, when companies realize that their great candidates are coming from all schools. 

The other note about quality of teaching is also partially true only. While these institutes will have generally smaller class sizes and easier to choose classes (at MIT I almost never had to worry about a class filling up or me not being able to get into one I wanted/needed), however the quality of teachers is not likely any better at any other school. And that's because none of your actual professors are hired, evaluated, or compensated for teaching. They are hired, promoted, evaluated, and retained for their research. To most of them teaching is a nuisance. So they get it done/out of the way with minimal effort required not to bomb their evals.


One last thing that isn't mentioned is that the cutting edge research being done at top rank schools is actually a very good reason to attend them. I worked in labs for 3 out of my 4 undergrad years. And the amount of resources these labs have is immense. So a great part of my education, which is how to conduct research and plan/execute experiments would have not been the same at a much lower ranked university."
142,AskAcademia,Why is it so difficult to get a job in academia?,"The job market, especially in anglo countries, is essentially global.

You apply for a job, and 50-400 other people do too, all of whom are essentially perfect for the position.  So ... you need a fair bit of luck."
143,AskAcademia,How do institutions handle cognitive decline in faculty?,We promote them to dean and don't give them any responsibilities.
144,AskAcademia,"My advisor showed me his LoR and asked me what I thought. He mentioned my poor undergrad grades but ""put a positive spin"" on them. Should I ask him to remove it?","Part of the purpose of LoR is to address things on your CV that an admissions committee might find questionable, such as poor undergraduate performance. It’s good that your advisor brought it up and - this is key - said how it did not negatively impact your higher-level academic success."
145,AskAcademia,How to deal with failure or massive fuck ups?,"Fuck up aside, i hope you realise you have a great professor. He sound like he really care about your wellbeing. And do take his advice"
146,AskAcademia,How to say no in Academia?,"I'd love to, but it would affect my ability to deliver **more important sounding task** to **more senior person**. Let's circle back on it at **time after their latest possible delivery date**?"
147,AskAcademia,When can I use the Dr. Title?,"In my field, it’s common to go by Dr. after you have successfully defended your dissertation. I do not think it would be inappropriate, but actually appropriate, to go by Dr."
148,AskAcademia,What are common misconceptions about academia?,"We get paid for our publications

We get paid summers off

We are all wealthy elites"
149,AskAcademia,Took a postdoc after PhD but I want out. How to transition successfully into industry?,"Just apply for jobs. There are plenty of jobs with a PhD as either a job requirement, or listed under “preferred qualifications.” There’s not necessarily a need to explain why you’re leaving academia; in general, only academics care about that"
150,AskAcademia,PhD advisor accused me of misconduct...???,"The idea is yours. It doesn't matter that you were working with your advisor when you generated it. Given this unfounded accusation and the fact that your advisor stole your idea and gave it to a visiting postdoc, I recommend that you contact the Research Integrity Officer (RIO)  for your university (if you are in the US, or the equivalent if you are not). I am the RIO for my university and your advisor is 100% in the wrong."
151,AskAcademia,How do people subscribed to Science and Nature find the time and energy to read all the papers not on their topic?,They don't.
152,AskAcademia,Blackballed by department for reporting gender bias to the chair... should I stay or should I go?,"The Title IX office should eat the first department alive for their egregious behavior. Given the loss of publications, you have material damages.

Are you sure everyone in the first department agreed with the decisions pushed by the chair? You may come out fine if it's just the old misogynistic bullies that are against you"
153,AskAcademia,How do some professors (in the US) earn half a million dollars?,"Soft money positions can make a lot more. I know some soft money professors at UCLA make 500k+ because they pull in so many grants. Also, industries that pay a lot (e.g., econ, medicine) have some departments that pay their top-tier professors a lot because they want those professors, and those professors could get a lot of money working in industry. Competing offers are always the best way to raise salary."
154,AskAcademia,Positives and benefits of a life in academia?,"I’d say this sub is heavily R1 biased, so I’ll comment about SLAC/PUI.

I don’t have the stress of applying for huge grants. I have a small start up (tiny to most) that lets me spend money ensuring my undergrads do their projects for me. If I want grants? Sure, I can apply. But my success is not directly tied to others’ successes - the one fear I had throughout my grad career - not being able to support other PhDs.

Teaching is a blast. Kids are dumb as rocks, and they’ll complain about a lot, but they’re also adults and for the most part are reasonable. Plus, I’ve found that the ones who are good are the ones who approach you, leading to quick self selection, where I have five brilliant students working with me on stuff. Are they slower than I’d be on my own? Fuck yes. I can run a study in a week, takes them all semester. But, my job isn’t dependent on me publishing - it will be determined how well these five motivated students do.

This summer, I’m writing a (wide range given) 24,000-52,000 word (about 100 pages) brief book. To just sit and write all day - the scary part is thinking of the profs who push out 300 page books a year (my advisor). I don’t have that big of an ego. But still, to write all day has been immensely pleasurable. My research continues slowly, and I keep so many different projects in the air at one time that I can task switch out if I’m bored.

I answer to mostly me. I did a non ac post doc, and having a true boss was unideal. My work was great; but I didn’t like having someone checking on me on how it was going, or getting approval.

I have an amazing and supportive spouse who is changing her career based on our move. The pandemic changed the change plans, but also bought her a year of work-from-home life that made her realize she wanted a career change. She also has equal power to pull the plug at any moment, which helps keep me motivated in my own research, since I’m not focused on my tenure packet (They’ve told us if we want it we’ll get it and research doesn’t matter) but for the job market, which is both insane but gives me something to fight for.

Basically, I pursue projects I like, with smart students and students who want a chance, with no true worries on grants, and have a spouse who is my rock."
155,AskAcademia,Appropriate to a wine bottle as a undergrad research assistant?,I think it's totally fine.
156,AskAcademia,What are office politics like in academia?,"Compared to the corporate world, there are three unpleasant things about academic politics. One is that there is no clear common goal. In the corporate world at any moment of time usually there's a well defined goal (profit, saving, market expansion, sales, loss reduction etc.), and if something doesn't work, it least in theory, you can always stand up and ask the team to relate back to the goal. Look, we are not doing ourselves any good by getting involved in THIS, because it does not move us towards our main goal for this year. And then supposedly everybody readjust.

In academia, large-scale goals are almost never articulated, so every person comes up with goals of their own, and there is no clear way to figure out what do we want as a team. Basically, except in situations of emergency, we never want anything collectively, as a team. Sometimes the majority of people happen to have their goals aligned, but it always happens spontaneously, not because we are explicitly required, or want to work together. I guess the whole mythology about tenure and academic freedom does not help here as well. People are so proud of the concept of academic freedom that they basically flip out every time somebody tells them what to do. It's very much a ""don't tread on me"" mentality. How dare you tell me how to teach! What speakers to invite! How to do research! People are very protective of their freedom, which is great, but it makes things harder in so many cases, as they may become protective of their freedom ""just in case"", preemptively, before any actual conflict arises.

Another, related complication, is that there is no culture of escalation and arbitrage. In the corporate world if you say ""do it"", and another person or function says ""don't do it"", you can always escalate to the management, have a meeting, and agree on the priorities. There is typically a procedure for resolving conflicts, and there is a clear power, so when sales and IT have a conflict, they just calculate the costs, have a meeting, put these costs together, and delegate the decision up. In academia the structure is much flatter, the responsibilities are less clear, and there is no culture of escalation. If you would write to the dean about a conflict with another faculty, it would be perceived as an insult and open war, not as a working moment that happens literally every other week. Which means that pretty much conflicts of interest can sit there for years without ever being resolved.

Finally, the last issue is that academics really like to think, analyze, and look into details, and really don't like making decisions. Which is the exact opposite of the corporate world: there people usually work against a pressure of time, so they know (or are taught the hard way) that in many cases it's more important to make _a_ decision, any decision, than over-analyze and procrastinate. So, at least in my experience, in the corporate world when you call a meeting, present your analysis, and no obvious red flags are identified, typically people vote for a ""go"" decision, and immediately send a proposal to the management. In academia typically nobody would believe your analysis, because they will feel that they need to do it themselves (not that they have the time of course), and then several hypothetical reservations will be voiced, and ""what if"" scenarios will be described, and a few people in the room will have some strong reservations they'll never voice (because, again, there is no culture of conflict resolution), and then everybody would agree to give it another thought, and maybe reconvene in half a year, or maybe form a committee, and give it another look, so forth and so on. There is no decision culture, and things can drag forever, even when people are generally sympathetic to the cause, just because they don't have a habit of working small things out in order to push something big forward."
157,AskAcademia,"What's more important in a PhD, having a great advisor or perfect research fit?",Great advisor. 100%.
158,AskAcademia,What's a POLITE way to remind a co-author he needs to hurry up with his revisions on our paper before the deadline?,"I hate these situations and these kinds of collaborators. They are also frustrating on proposals where you wait and wait for their one paragraph of input and then it's terrible and don't know how to get them knocked off the budget. 

I don't really know what works, but you can also change media - i.e. call instead of email, knock on their office door, etc. Do you NEED their revisions? You can also give one more email like - I need these by Friday and will assume you are fine with the revised version if not received. Though that's also a bit weird in tone - are they needed, or not? Grrr."
159,AskAcademia,Is there any other industry which requires so much training for so little reward and so little job security?,"Pretty much any part of the arts? Try being a classical composer for example (where lots of people also have Ph.Ds!). Ballet is another easy one. You're finished by the time you're 27 or so. I'd also mention sound technician, lousy pay for 12+ hour days, going deaf and no job security.

&#x200B;

Yes it should be better in academia, but we're far from being the only ones."
160,AskAcademia,Is it too late to start a PhD at 26?,"That’s not late at all, where are you getting this idea from? Tons of people start later and they do just fine."
161,AskAcademia,Is it bad to want to quit and just find a normal job?,"In the US there ~10 more PhD students starting than permanent positions are rewarded in academia and it properly doesn't look so different in other countries. Hence, dropping out of academia is the rule and not the exception nowadays. So, it's not a failure in anyway, despite what your supervisors may like to tell you. 
 But it doesn't necessarily mean to stop doing science. Many companies have a research & development department and many startups are also interested in people with a scientific expertise. So, you may end up in a place with lots of former Postdocs. But even many non-research positions can benefit from having a scientific education. 

So, you may to want to see academia as only one of many ways to build your career and it might not be the best for you."
162,AskAcademia,I'm a full professor in Information Science. I wrote a journal article I am very proud of; I was falsely accused of plagiarism by a journal; now I'm being ghosted by the editors of the journal. What should my next steps be?,"5 days is not enough time for the editors to discuss the issue among themselves. I understand your impatience as being wrongly accused of cheating or plagiarism is a stressful thing. You can obviously request the info on your alleged copying of others' work without citation, but since you wrote at least two messages so far I'd wait *at least* a week more before taking any other action. Good luck!

(Also I don't recommend posting it on social media or going nuclear about it in general from the very beginning. If there's been a misundestanding, there are ways to explain everything)."
163,AskAcademia,Is it normal to get angry at a student for ignoring advice and wasting their own time (teaching undergrads)?,"The frustration you are feeling is natural. The course is designed to teach the student certain skills, and despite their engagement with you they seem to not want to take the time to learn those skills, instead opting for something that is easier for them. In coming to your office hours but ignoring your advice they wasted not only their time but yours. Watching someone fail because they ignore the help provided to them is a frustrating thing. Feeling that frustration is normal. As you’ve said, in the end if they fail the assignment it’s on them not you. You’ve done your part and they’ve chosen to ignore you. You have to divorce yourself from their choices. You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. Sometimes people need to learn the hard way."
164,AskAcademia,I hate my PhD supervisors. Is it worth even continuing?,"It sounds like you've already made your mind up, but being as big of a decision as it is you (naturally) want to validate your decision. 

Three years is a long time to spend doing a programme you are not enjoying. Keep in mind, you can always apply again to another PhD programme. Taking the time to find a programme that is right for you is always worth it."
165,AskAcademia,"I was not allowed to finish my PhD, my work got accepted at a top-tier CS conference, what's next?","You need to have somebody senior at your current school mediating the case for you. You can switch advisors to B and continue the work. Having a paper accepted at a good conference may not be good enough to meet the graduation requirements for some schools, at least in CS. Unless your work is definitely ground breaking, best paper award caliber, you may still need at least two other papers to graduate. Moving to other school is an option, with a published paper some advisors may be interested. But you may have to start over, do more coursework, and so on. Also, we only know your part of the story. Some advisors may be reluctant to hire you because you had trouble somewhere else."
166,AskAcademia,Did any Professors go easy on the grades this semester?,"We weren’t encouraged to “go easy” but to be accommodating- which means more deadline extensions and that sort of thing. 

Scores in my classes ended up being pretty typical. Lots of As and Bs but also some Ds and Fs. I didn’t make it easier, I just took more late assignments and allowed quizzes to be made up late."
167,AskAcademia,Is it appropriate for me to contact professors from 3+ years ago for letters of recommendation?,"Sure! I’ve written letters for students I had much further ago than 3 years, and regularly write for students who graduated in the last few years."
168,AskAcademia,Is it insane to withdraw my first authorship on a submitted (not yet accepted) manuscript because I want to dissociate myself from my toxic ex-PI?,"I see where you're coming from, but I would likely choose to be included on the manuscript. I would also request that this co-first author person be primarily responsible for the submission/revision of the manuscript (saves you from dealing directly with the PI more than simply approving the manuscript). If you ever decide to return to academia, it wouldn't hurt to have the extra publication."
169,AskAcademia,Explain like I’m five why I shouldn’t do a self funded PhD. Why do so many do it?,"Okay so here is the problem:

Money.

Tuition, living and all other costs are huge, especially over several years. So unless you have access to ample private funds, I would not.

The additional stress about money is not worth it otherwise"
170,AskAcademia,I don’t want to be a trailing partner but I love my academic boyfriend - how do I talk about this productively?,"I’m in a similar situation to your BF. My wife and I have been together since the end of my undergrad (we moved for my grad school, postdoc, and expect to move for a faculty/industry position afterwards). My wife has a great job who supports her ability to work fully remotely. The compromise to the “trailing partner” dilemma we’ve had is that I’ve made her an important part of every decision to move based on her preferences. I had multiple grad school offers and postdoc offers, in a number of different locations. As long as I was happy with my shortlist of choices, I made sure she had a significant say in where we ended up. I think this way has given her some agency in deciding where to live, even if the list of options had to be compatible for my career. When the time comes for me to decide between faculty and industry, if and where I get faculty options will matter. Because even though it’s my slight preference, a faculty job offer at a university located somewhere she doesn’t want to live in will mean I either keep looking or move to industry (where the hubs are all in mostly nice metropolitan areas she would agree to live in). 

Long story short, I think if someone on the academic career path is serious about their partner they should consider their preferences even if it means sacrificing your absolute “top” choice from a career aspect."
171,AskAcademia,Does lecture prep and teaching every get easier?,"It definitely does, and the longer you teach a course the easier it gets. The course I have been teaching the longest, I have been teaching since 2011 and I can pretty much do it eyes closed now, with zero prep. Well done for putting in all this work now, it will stand you in really good stead going forward."
172,AskAcademia,I just received tenure track offer and start up package - do I need to negotiate? Is it gauche to discuss with a new prof in the dept?,"First off, congrats!!

Build yourself a spreadsheet of all the operating costs you anticipate having in the first couple years before you get grants - equipment you need that isn't already at the school, recurring wet lab materials, staff, lab furniture, etc. Get really specific with what everything costs and how much you need. Then color code it with what is *absolutely fundamental,* aka you cannot do the job you were hired for without it (do you need to supervise students in the first couple years to meet tenure requirements?), vs. what would suck to lose but technically could still do some work, and what would be nice to have. Then add up those costs. If it were January, I'd say try to negotiate for the cost of the first two categories, but nowadays it's probably best to only ask for the first and not risk losing the offer. Without the startup you absolutely need to function, you're technically a negative investment for the school, the department, and yourself, so that's what you should ask for and present it along with the spreadsheet justifying why you need that amount. Taking that approach makes it a conversation about ""how can we together make this productive,"" instead of something adversarial where you're trying the get the most boon for yourself. I wouldn't try to negotiate the salary if you're decently happy with it, since you're already unhappy with the start up so that should be the focal point.  

Hopefully your new department head will be on your side and help advocate for you to the dean, because they want this position filled before the school might make it disappear. You could also talk to them with your spreadsheet first before going to the school, if you feel like you have a good relationship with them, about what creative solutions might exist already in the department that you aren't currently aware of. For instance, post-interview I found out there is a built in moving fund and conference travel fund for all new faculty at my institution so I didn't have to negotiate for those.

This is the negotiation process I took to great success. Granted though, that was in January and my field is cognitive neuroscience. Good luck OP!"
173,AskAcademia,Is it a career killer to attend the same school as undergrad for a PhD?,"I use to hear that was a killer but don't anymore. And when i was on the job market I dont' think many even knew where I did my undergrad (I had gone to different places). I think there are benefits for going elsewhere, but I don't think it'll hurt you if you don't. Go where you think you can be most successful. 

It's funny because I do still hear all the time don't stay in place from PhD to postdoc to faculty position, but man, departments of full of hiring their own!"
174,AskAcademia,When was/is it time to cash out?,"Over 100 pubs, a couple books, former tenured full prof.  We had not gotten merit-based raises in 8 years, I was advising 3 PhD students with no course release, and was graduate director.  Those that do, just keep getting asked to do more.  I had gotten a decent (but not great) raise only by getting an outside offer.  I love my new position in industry; irony is I still get to do research & teach."
175,AskAcademia,How to tell my PhD advisor that I don't want to be a professor anymore?,"There were twelve amazing people in my doctoral cohort. Fifteen years later, two people are still working as faculty members in higher education (myself and one other person).

Life happens. People decide to start families, take positions that make sense for other reasons, or just choose not to go into academia. Believe me, the mentors of our cohort don't blame a single person for where their path ended up taking them. From your description of your accomplishments, you are the doc student every professor dreams of mentoring. Do what makes sense for you."
176,AskAcademia,Totally bombed my first TT job interview; advice from those who’ve been there?,"It gets easier after the first one. 

Congrats on getting interviews! It's trickier to do this via zoom, but if you come away excited or unsure, listen to those feelings. I hope the next round is a good one!"
177,AskAcademia,Colons in article titles: Yes or no?,Boring Article Topics: Liven it up with a Pun
178,AskAcademia,Is academia underpaid in the US?,"Swiss is probably the only place (in its face value) that makes academia \_seems\_ adequately paid. In fact, most of the places in the world are underpaying postdocs and also APs. Right now in the US we are admitting even more Ph.D. students (in my case, 2x), and that means the job market will be more competitive after \~5 years..."
179,AskAcademia,Is it necessary to have an academic twitter account?,"Reading tweets by professors outside their area of expertise comes in slightly below ""headbutting my way through 6 feet of concrete"" in my own heirarchy of fun.  But when they actually know what they're talking about, it can be pretty interesting."
180,AskAcademia,Is burnout normal in academics?,It’s sadly very common. Try to prioritize mental health now. Don’t tell yourself to push trough and deal with that stuff after finishing the PhD. I’ve seen many friends where this strategy did not work out well.
181,AskAcademia,"I recently graduated from my university with a doctorate degree, and because I am no longer a current student they have removed my access to the library databases. What do I do?","Most universities have some sort of courtesy appointment that they can give to affiliated researchers that provides library access and a few other privileges.  Ask your advisor to get you one of those appointments.  They generally come with zero pay and no real obligations.  It is expected that you will collaborate with someone at some point and perhaps interact with some of the grad students, otherwise you bring no value to the university, but as they are not paying you this is not a heavy obligation.  Usually, these appointments need only be signed by the Dean."
182,AskAcademia,Did any other academics end up taking a more blue-collar career path?,I have family that uses a HVAC repair guy that is also a tenured biology professor and does AC work on the side.
183,AskAcademia,How do I tell my supervisor that my assigned grad student is doing no work?,"Send your supervisor an email, or say this at the end of a one-on-one meeting if you have those regularly: ""Hey, can we have a chat about how it's going with me working with GradStudent? I have some things on my mind.""

Then enter that chat with some concrete examples that demonstrate your point. ""In meetings, GradStudent is only pretending to have done work"" is not a strong example because it relies on your judgement of the grad student's statements -- for example, your supervisor could easily disagree based on how they judge people. So, instead you want specific examples, like ""GradStudent said they would have the code written by early July, but it's still not done, and it's keeping me from doing that special analysis.""

As in my made-up example above, your examples should also be things that pertain to you, because your job here is not to expose GradStudent as a lazy do-nothing (only their supervisor should worry about that), but to explain how GradStudent is holding you back in your own work. Your supervisor *will* care about that aspect.

Also mention that you feel like you're not getting a chance in meetings to present your own results. This is a separate issue, and very easily remedied by your supervisor. Just let them know that you're trying to be polite and make sure everyone else has space to speak, but now the meetings keep running out of time for you to speak, so maybe Supervisor can call on you or something every meeting? This is a great request because it's an easy fix."
184,AskAcademia,Why do professors ignore letter of recommendation requests instead of just declining?,"When did you send the email? Did you send it from your university address? Our IT department has ridiculous spam filters and unless emails come from a .edu account they're likely to go to spam. 

Are you asking professors who know you well? Beyond just good performance in one class?

You can send a polite follow-up email. And if they still don't respond you can drop by their office hours to ask.

Sometimes emails get lost in the shuffle. Sometimes professors won't respond if they feel they don't know you well (your email deserves a response, in my view). Sometimes we thought we responded but did not. Sometimes your email is the lowest priority on my to-do list, and it takes me a while to get to it. You should send a reminder email 1 - 1.5 weeks after the first email."
185,AskAcademia,I think my boss has been playing me and as a result my career is likely ruined. Help?,"I feel like I've known this PI... anyway, you need to make plans to leave the lab even if you don't get an academic job this cycle. This will only get worse. Are you 'doomed?' lmao no. PhDs need to respect themselves more and leave these trash labs. You have your degree and are not in the same situation as one of this woman's students. Presumably you have other contacts."
186,AskAcademia,Is 28 too old to start a PhD?,God no
187,AskAcademia,I just completed PhD in Comparative Literature at an Ivy League; fell in love with another field (East Asian Studies) and find myself fantasizing about doing a second PhD. If anything in this world was possible and I could overcome anything that stood in my way: how would I go about doing that?,"It is not common. It would be exceptionally rare, and not necessarily in a ""wow cool, two phds"" way but in a ""uhhh, why did you do two phds?"" way. If I was considering your PhD application, I would be happy admitting you. But I would also be very skeptical about offering you funding. While the reality is that doctoral students are also affordable labor, the commitment narrative is always about whether students will become contributors to our field. That is, tenured professors who produce publications and expand our network. Thats why your mentors and colleagues are disappointed in your decision to not get out there. The switch you want to do would strongly suggest that you don't intend to be that or there is something else funny going on with you. Now, admittedly, I've never been a tenured professor at a PhD program, just privy to admissions cycles while on temporary appointment. 

The more serious thing you should consider is that a second PhD would be interpreted very poorly in a job application. The conversation would immediately be ""no way does this person have the focus to get tenure."" That I do have recent experience with. But I am speaking entirely from the perspective of the US academy here. Maybe it's different in Europe."
188,AskAcademia,I'm in a really unfortunate situation and I don't know what to do. Help?,"Can you go and sit with the senior “dissenter” and ask (perhaps with your new advisor) what should and can realistically be changed to make this a defensible thesis? Surely they are aware of your situation and need to work with you in a positive and fair manner. Stacking the committee is one approach, but another one is to try to move it forward."
189,AskAcademia,Is there professional pressure for academics of underrepresented demographics to lean into their racial identity?,"While I'm about as white as can be, I am blind. I asked a professor once if I could be a professor as a blind person, just to see if I'd have any insurmountable hurdles.  

He gave a long sigh and said, ""I'm saying this as respectfully as possible, but it'll probably help your chances of getting hired."" 

So. There's that."
190,AskAcademia,Has anyone ever reported their academic advisor/supervisor and things actually improved after that?,"Reported? Yes. 

Improved. Not at all. In fact, shit got worse."
191,AskAcademia,"Professor here, why don't undergrads reply to my emails when I'm offering them help? Even if they initiate the exchange?","Advisor here. I get students in my office all the time telling me about how they're failing a class. First thing I ask is whether they have spoken to their instructor; it's almost always a 'no.' Why?

 Because the student feels they're an inconvenience, a burden, that they're doing everything wrong and that fading out of sight is making way for you use your time helping 'good' students. I've noticed two trends:

1. Anxiety. Rapid interconnection of technology now means that most people can't get away from all the online negativity if they tried, whether it's politics, world events, etc. This instills a generalized anxiety and powerlessness which affects them in other parts of life, like school. And because of this anxiety, even the slightest perception of annoyance on your part in an email can trigger the student. Not that you ARE showing any annoyance, I'm sure, but remember that an email is a pretty emotionless medium, and an already anxious student will fill the void with their own emotional perceptions. I find that you kind of have to spell out your intentions of support so the student's anxiety can't run wild.

2. Misinformation about instructors. Maybe this is tied to the anxiety, but I always have to convince students that going to office hours isn't inconveniencing or burdening the instructor. I legit have to tell them, ""Your professor is being paid to have those office hours, it's part of their job."" They seriously don't get that."
192,AskAcademia,Is it normal to feel nervous sharing research? I guess a branch of imposter syndrome?,Totally normal. Nuff said.
193,AskAcademia,What are some must reads for scientists in the STEM fields?,"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas Kuhn.

The book is the one that coined the phrase ""paradigm shift,"" but it's not a book about corporate speak (as that term has come to be utilized), but the nature of and diminution of past forms of scientific knowledge."
194,AskAcademia,What all makes the future of academia so bleak?,Adjuncts are being paid abyssmal wages to teach a large number of courses. It diminishes the entire system when we rely on extreme exploitation of our colleagues for our schools to survive.
195,AskAcademia,How often does research work go down the drain just because of a silly human error?,"In my undergraduate research, I accidentally led a few grad students down a rabbit hole of what seemed to be incredible interesting results... Turns out I had just mislabeled the sample and nothing interesting had actually happened. The result was a week of wasted efforts and my PI asked I give a short presentation during group meeting on the importance of labeling samples correctly and good organization. I imagine situations like that probably happen everyday."
196,AskAcademia,"""Nobody reads dissertations after the defense"" - is this still broadly true?","Many times the thesis isn't a public document and the papers that consist of the chapters have already been published and are known to be vetted through peer review. This is why the thesis itself isn't read. If you change these dynamics, like by having your thesis available for download on research gate and you're in a field where the thesis isn't basically a collection of your papers,  then it's more likely to be read

Edit: spelling"
197,AskAcademia,How did the 2008 economic crisis affect academia?,"Lots of newly unemployed people (especially those just a few years out of undergrad) returned to school for masters degrees, which led my university to expand its professional degree programs, though that expansion didn’t happen until 2010 or 2011.

ETA: this was at a large R1. Probably a very different story at smaller schools, slacs, etc."
198,AskAcademia,"How important are journal publications, really?","The problem is that you can't logic your way through this; there is no logic to the dire job market in the humanities beyond its being weighted toward those coming from elite institutions (and even that's no longer a guarantee). Publications help, unless they don't. References help, unless they don't. Your research area helps, unless it doesn't."
199,AskAcademia,Is it possible to find ethical work in unethical companies?,"I'm not in STEM--I'm a humanities professor. 

But many (many) years ago, before I went back for my PhD, I took a job with an aerospace company.   It was great--I was working (in the publications section) on a solar optical space-born telescope project.  How cool is that??!   Loved it.  

Then the project finished, and they shifted me to another project.  One involving the deployment of nuclear weapons systems... and though I needed the job, I screwed up the courage, and told them I wouldn't work on it...  they needed to shift me back to another NASA-like project. 

My bosses' boss, when I explained my position, looked at me with disgust , and said (I will never forget it, or the look on her face):   ""I didn't know you were one of *them.*"" 

She then said they didn't have any current needs on space-stuff, and let me go. 

I'm still kind of proud of the decision I made that day... I was young, and it took a lot of courage.  (and it cost me... I had to work on a cleanup crew for a construction company for months after that, just to pay bills.)   But I didn't have kids or a mortgage or anything, so it wasn't a big deal.   Then I went back to grad school. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is:  even if you get into an ""ethical"" side of the company, there's a pretty good chance you'll be moved/asked to work with the unethical side of the company.   

(and unethical sides of companies attract very specific types of people.) 

Probably not totally relevant, because this was so long ago, but still.... thought I'd share just in case."
200,AskAcademia,Would it be appropriate to thank my therapist in my MA thesis acknowledgements?,"Why not?  In my PhD dissertation  I acknowledged my dog ""for helping me stay sane"".  Nobody blinked."
201,AskAcademia,Harassment from student - avenues for reporting?,"100000% false that undergrads cannot be reported for sexual harassment. Sexual harassment does not go away because of power imbalances. If you are being sexually harassed you need to report it immediately to Title IX sand to your department chair. You should ask that this student be immediately removed from your class.

If your university has a behavioral intervention team, report there, too. I would also reach out to the Dean of Students and ask for their assistance in helping you achieve a harassment-free workplace."
202,AskAcademia,What does it feel like to be an unemployed Ph.D?,"This was me for a little while. I finished my PhD in medical science but didn’t have a postdoc lined up for afterwards. I did some brief (very low skilled) tech work which, tbh, was a little humiliating. 
I ended up travelling internationally for a postdoc. I never really wanted to but i don’t really regret it. Ended up going into industry after that. I could see my career trajectory was not what is required for success in academia. 
I’m quite happy in industry. I feel less stressed about job security/career continuity. 
I hate to say it but I think post-degree employment should e a real consideration for people and some fields have more industry options than others."
203,AskAcademia,Is it possible to have a kid with someone who is only just about to start his PhD?,"There were several married couples with kids in grad school.  They were not able to pull 14 hour days in the lab, like I was, but they wasted a lot less time than I did.  If you're serious and mature, you can make it work."
204,AskAcademia,Why are only Ivy League schools pausing PhD admissions?,"Also,  public universities rely more heavily on graduate labor to teach survey courses."
205,AskAcademia,Singular 'they' in academic writing?,"I absolutely think ""they"" is appropriate to refer to someone of an unknown gender. I used this myself in my master's thesis. I think the ""she for speaker, he for hearer"" sounds confusing and unnecessary, personally."
206,AskAcademia,Hypothetically what would happen if I reported this professor?,"I disagree with the above posters—if you file a report, even leaving out some names or without direct evidence, many Title IX offices will feel compelled to open an investigation.  They have legal obligations to protect employees and students from harm, including quid pro quo sexual harassment.  Depending on the details, this may all be legal and not a violation of university policy; it could be fully consensual on both sides, with the students outside of his chain of supervision and disclosed to his supervisors.  But if not, this could easily be a policy violation that would lead to discipline for him.  

Whether that is good or bad for the current/former students might vary—but if this is ongoing conduct where he is abusing his power, the university must think about the interests of his future victims as well as about the need to deter similar actions by other faculty.  

With all that said, Title IX offices vary widely in terms of their professionalism and seriousness, and it isn’t impossible that this would get blown off at some schools.  Just know that that isn’t necessarily the norm anymore, and schools do face legal pressures to take these kind of reports quite seriously.  

Source: I’m a law prof, and my wife used to do Title IX investigations.  She was involved in cases very similar to this, and recommended discipline against tenured profs who engaged in relations with students, when those students subsequently maintained that their consent wasn’t fully voluntary, but was in fact at least a partial result of the power imbalance."
207,AskAcademia,Why is an European PhD considered shorter than an American PhD when an American PhD is really a Masters + PhD?,"Because in the US if you do a Masters' and a PhD you are still expected to take 4+ years to do your PhD. And the ""MSc+PhD"" is often 6+ years long.

So any way you cut it it tends to be longer than in europe."
208,AskAcademia,How do I study and retain information from papers and books that I read on my computer?,"100% get an ipad/tablet/whatever with a bluetooth pen and use something like goodnotes. It's changed studying for me forever. And you can organise everything into folders for easy access, which is so helpful."
209,AskAcademia,Why is it called a faculty retreat?,Faculty retreats are meditation retreats with a high difficulty setting.
210,AskAcademia,Am I Being Realistic in My Reasons for Pursing a PhD?,"Great reasons, clearly it means a lot to you. The reality of doing a PhD will not be as rosy since it's a long grueling process and you won't make much money. But if you enjoy digging into unexplored topics and writing about your findings you'll fare just fine."
211,AskAcademia,How to read long tedious research articles?,"I’m in bio-sciences/healthcare. I don’t read the whole thing. 
Read the abstract, read the last 1-2 paragraphs of the conclusions, look at the figures. If it’s not clear what the take-away is at that point, read the results (at least the headers). The only times I read the materials/methods are when I’m confused about the results (so I look for design flaws) or I’m trying to recreate/do something similar. The materials/methods are the most boring bits, in my opinion. Jumping around front to back to pictures breaks up the wall of text a bit for me."
212,AskAcademia,is there anyway I can avoid paying 50$ for research papers?,Scihub
213,AskAcademia,How to handle talking students in class?," I would shut it down quickly and be very direct. I will do what you did with asking if they have any questions but if that doesn't stop the talking, I will stop what I am doing and just look at them until they figure it out and stop once their classmates start to stare at them. If that doesn't work, I'll stop what I am doing, look at them, and say, ""please stop talking"". If that doesn't work, I'll speak to them after class about it."
214,AskAcademia,Is a Masters/PhD as a single parent of a toddler possible?,"So I’ve recently started taking care of my mom who has dementia, on a postdoc stipend. I think in many ways it’s like taking care of a toddler as a single parent. There’s no one to help around the house at all, no one to shuttle between or schedule endless doctors appointments, no one to provide support in any capacity, just endless need. It is exceedingly difficult to spend the amount t of time I need to spend doing science with these responsibilities.

Someone posted here sometime ago about Ruth Bader Ginsburg saying that having a family forced her to be more deliberate about her working hours. I think if you feel mentally strong and like you have a stable support system you should be able to manage. 

Without a support system I can tell you it is exceedingly difficult to meet the demands of the job while being a kind, patient, caring human at home."
215,AskAcademia,First year grad student feeling alone in the pandemic... Does it get better? Am I the only one?,"We're all feeling pressure like this; it's not just grad school. I haven't been in to my office or lab since March. I haven't seen coworkers since March. I haven't been able to travel for work since February (I'd had at least 4 trips including a conference in Barcelona that had to get cancelled, arghhhhhhhhhh). Most of my coworkers aren't even getting on Slack/Jabber/etc anymore because we're old and they're not as good at technology as younger people. Hardly anyone turns on their webcams at meetings anymore. Heck, my wife isn't even willing to eat food from a restaurant. I'm dying for a real piece of pizza, bowl of Pho, or some freaking schwarma.

Times are brutal right now, but we have to recognize this is the best choice of what we can do right now. Chilling at home with my cats is better than my wife's job, where she's required to report in to her office every day, only to sit on WebEx calls all day because everyone else is still at home.

If your school offers any sort of psychological counseling or support groups, definitely use it. Grad school, on its own, is really hard, and right now I'm sure it's even worse. I just wanted to let you know things aren't really any better in the ""real world."""
216,AskAcademia,I really enjoyed my Master's. Is that a sign I should apply for a PhD?,"If you liked the independent research aspect, then you might enjoy a PHD. The people in my program who left early often did well in the classes at the beginning of the program, but had no idea how to work independently on research projects. 

The main consideration when starting a PHD is what next? For a PHD in Biomedical Science, I think less than 15% of graduates remain in academic research. What type of job do you want? Will having a PHD open up mobility in that job? It's very field specific."
217,AskAcademia,Is it okay to send old professors gifts?,I can’t imagine why not; especially if it’s something small like a mug and a card. You’re not their student anymore and they already wrote the recommendation letters.
218,AskAcademia,Transphobia in academia? How to handle?,"To be frank, your group mates sound like assholes. If you've asked them repeatedly not to dead name you and use your preferred pronouns and they're unwilling to be empathetic and treat you with dignity, I'd be reporting them to whatever university office handles cases of discrimination. 

All universities are different in how they handle name changes. My university will by in large be accommodating, but unless it's a legal name change, there are some forms they can't change. So Blackboard might show their preferred name, but the internal program for grade reporting shows their legal name."
219,AskAcademia,Is it all that bad?,"Some of the complaints people have a field dependent. But in general, there are far more PhDs than there are available teaching positions at universities in the US. That alone will make it difficult. You will really have to make yourself stand out to be successful."
220,AskAcademia,Does North Korea publish research?,Yes. [Here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b00406) is an example. I've only run across the occasional computational chemistry paper.
221,AskAcademia,Is it rude to use headphones in the PhD office?,"It's perfectly fine, as long as you're not refusing to talk to people if they want to get your attention it should not be a problem. I've never seen an office where people *didn't* use headphones unless that office was under the iron thumb of a psychopath."
222,AskAcademia,I am considering leaving my PhD after 4 weeks. Should I?,Quitting now is the best time to quit: before you feel you’ve sunk too much time into it. There’s no shame in it. If the department is toxic and your supervisor is too—and there’s no way out—then leave. Maybe apply again and attend a more supportive place.
223,AskAcademia,Is it acceptable for a hobbyist to contact a professional researcher?,"I think it depends on why you want to contact them and what you want to get out of the conversation. If it's a request for a syllabus or a copy of a paper, I think that's fine. If you have questions about their book or article -- that you've tried to answer by doing additional research -- that is fine too, though you might not get a response. If it's to ask for tutoring/advising/other labor-intensive things, then I would not email them.

You might get a response. You might not. My inbox priorities are (in random order): my dean and chair, my current students, current advisees, former students and advisees, professional associations and research collaborators, journal reviews, my university community, my geographic community. Then, if I have time, I'll try to respond to emails from random people. Sometimes I just don't have time. So don't be offended if you do not get a response. 

You could try looking up the person on their university's webpage, to see if you can find a direct email address."
224,AskAcademia,How do I politely decline a PhD offer without burning bridges with my potential advisor?,Literally tell your advisor the explanation which you posted here.
225,AskAcademia,How to supervise student with autism?,If the person is in a Ph.D. program they’re likely pretty high-functioning.  Can you ask them?  Some autistic people are receptive to that and can tell you what they need.  I wouldn’t have been able to verbalize it in grad school (I’m an autistic Ph.D. myself) but I can now.
226,AskAcademia,Does anyone think universities are going to divide into a North v South* type response to coronavirus in the fall?,Nope. Blue state here. We are losing massive amounts of money as it is. We will 100% be open for business in the fall (key word in the sentence: b u s i n e s s). Unis cannot afford another year like this.
227,AskAcademia,Is using Turnitin or other anti-plagiarism software unethical?,"Well, on a somewhat related note, John Warner recently pointed out that essay mills are using Turnitin's plagiarism checker tools to make sure that the papers they write for students can pass: https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/final-nail-coffin-turnitin"
228,AskAcademia,Should I cancel an interview if I’m not planning to accept the job?,"A verbal offer is not an official job offer and things could still go south. It’s unlikely but can happen. Until you have signed a written offer, keep the other interview."
229,AskAcademia,Can Anyone Get ANY Work Done from Home?,"It's been a big problem for me. I can do a 12 hour day in the lab no problem, but trying to do an hour of work from home is like dragging myself over coals"
230,AskAcademia,How common is it to pass a PhD defense with conditions?,"Conditions are revisions if rhey are requesting changes to the thesis  and are near universal. A pass with revisions is still a pass. Examiners feel like they have to request some changes to justify their role, and nothing is ever 100% perfect anyway. Minor revisions is as good as it gets.  Congrads. You got a PhD, Doctor."
231,AskAcademia,Do humanities / social science academics ever get wealthy?,"A lot of public universities have the salary information of professors available online, you can look at the numbers there and see what constitutes well paid or not.
Some may make decent or moderately good wages, but also live in areas with a very low cost of living. Then, even if you aren't ""wealthy"" you can be very comfortable.

Some of it is relative wage to cost of living essentially."
232,AskAcademia,Protecting data during travel to China?,"I'd honestly just bring a pre-paid cell phone, set up an automated email message saying you're traveling and will be back on whatever date, don't access your normal work email at all, and then have a throwaway email account that you can use for emergencies, or if your students need to contact you."
233,AskAcademia,"Loved the PhD, hate the postdoc. How to quit?","Sounds like a bad lab fit. It happens. I had the opposite that you did : terrible PhD experience and now a wonderful post doc experience. Wasn’t even looking for it when I found it but it worked. That being said, you should go somewhere that you will be happy. It sounds like you would do well in research, just with the right mentor ship. There is no shame in saying this is not working out for me and looking elsewhere, you just have to explicitly state that to whomever you will be interviewing next with."
234,AskAcademia,Graduate Student Unions. Yay or Nay?,"**I want to be clear**: you should all join a union. 

That said, I don't think current structure of graduate school is well-suited for graduate student unions, *as it currently exists in the USA for science/engineering disciplines*. I say this because PhD students are *students* their first couple of years, with a fair amount of PIs paying their students to essentially take classes and train in the laboratory. Usually, the turnaround time for most on-the-job training programs are measured in weeks or months, not years! 

I think western Europe does it right when it comes to obtaining a PhD. Most students obtain their master's degree first, with some laboratory training. Then, they apply to receive their PhD based off their performance in the lab and classes. If hired, they are treated (more properly) as employees. The USA tends to go at it with a one-size-fits-all approach for the entirety of graduate school, which I don't think makes anyone really happy."
235,AskAcademia,Ten No Bullshit Facts about College?,"""It is literally my job to help you (within certain obvious limits) with any assignment that you ask for help with.""

""You are not going to ask for enough help."""
236,AskAcademia,What leads to mobbing and doctoral push out? Is this part of the doctoral process?,"As other commenters have written, sometimes this has to do with a stubborn or difficult student who does not work well with faculty in the department. But there are other situations. 

At my university, we had a student who was pushed out in his third year when no one would work with him because he had a pattern of sexually harassing female undergraduates. No surprises there. 

In another case, a female student struggled with an extremely misogynistic advisor who passed her over time and again in favor of male students. She was in a very specific field that did not transfer well to other PIs in the department, so even though she wanted to complete her program, she was pretty much in a losing situation. Her options were to: 1) pivot late in her program into another field that she was not particularly interested in pursuing; 2) do all the legwork to find separate funding sources and alternate supervisors either outside of her field in her same institution or to collaborate with external researchers (significant legwork for a student without supervisor support); 3) transfer to another university entirely (which could mean starting all over again with new classes and research); 4) or leave-- so she took her masters into industry, partially at the advice of sympathetic faculty in the department. Again, depressingly, not a surprise."
237,AskAcademia,Why do we hate Elsevier so much?,"Oh, where does one start? The core issue is that they have been lobbying and pushing against open access. In my opinion, they have done so with both direct and indirect means.

Direct means include submitting evidence in policy meetings, claiming how open science is ‘bad science’ and spending millions in lobbying. They have been exploiting their dominant position—which is further established through indirect means—to push-up prices. Sweden and Germany couldn’t reach an agreement with them and have cancelled subscriptions to them. If not mistaken, they are the only major publisher we (Swedish academics) can’t pay any open access fees through our national OA scheme. They have sued ISPs to block Sci-Hub and overly engaged in an overzealous campaign to keep everything behind their paywall.

Indirect means include pushing tools like *Scorpus* and *CiteScore* for an overall ’quantification’ of science that has led to people preferring existing non-OA journals and venues with high impact factor. This, of course, has other consequences in the lives of academics as we are now playing a MinMax game every time we apply for a promotion or a new position.

Do other publishers use a dubious paywall model exploiting academic labour? Yes, they do. Do they go around to enforce their paywall to the same extent as Elsevier? No, they do not --at least, not to my knowledge."
238,AskAcademia,is 4-6 weeks notice enough?,"You're doing everything right and that's completely fair. Your current boss is being immature and unprofessional. He should be happy for you that you've found a stable, good paying job! Rest easy. You have done nothing wrong."
239,AskAcademia,What is it like to work in academic publishing/science communication (STEM PhD)?,"I’m an editor-in-chief at a high tier journal. Shortish answers:

1. It’s relative competitive. Not as bad as tenure track positions. If you get an interview, it’ll be a half or full day, they will get you assess manuscripts on the spot, talk about hot topics in the field, etc. Typically a Ph.D. is required in the field of the journal (I.e., chemistry for, say, Nature Chemistry... usually they look for a more specific area... like carbon catalysis or something... depends how big the journal is). 

2. Job security is pretty good. Mostly lateral movements from journal to journal (or when new journals launch). 

3. Assistant editors start around the $70K range. Depends on the journal/publisher. 

4. Depends on the team. Close to a 9-5, but teams are typically spread out geographically, which leads to flexibility. Sometimes there’s early morning meetings to chat with authors in China, Europe, etc. Work life balance is respected. Meet some deadlines, and no one expects to work more than 40 hours a week (approximately). 

5. About 50% of the job is handling papers, from submission through peer review to publication (or rejection). There’s also the planning of events (webinars, symposia, etc.). Strategic meetings with other journals. Recently travel is waaaay down (I.e., COVID), but most journals have a healthy travel budget for conferences and site visits (travel to a university to give a talk and network with researchers). I’d say 5-6 trips per year, some international, some domestic, conferences of different sizes.

Any other questions, just ask!"
240,AskAcademia,Is it unusual to be asked to do a panel presentation at a conference AND be required to pay registration?,"It varies a lot, but it's not uncommon to require regular/not high profile speakers to be paid attendees if they are also the target audience for the conference or if they applied to be a speaker (vs being invited).

Unless the conference is a total scam, they will probably waive your registration fee if you tell them that you have no intention of attending the conference sessions and cannot remain on the panel if it requires a $500 fee. It could also possibly have been a mistake that they sent the registration instructions--that happened to a panel I was organizing one year with government speakers who were absolutely not required to pay, but someone accidentally sent the email to the full speakers list."
241,AskAcademia,Why is expertise often disregarded by the general public with regard to the humanities?,"Goethe put it himself: “Because everyone uses language to talk, everyone thinks they can talk about language."""
242,AskAcademia,I enjoy learning but I feel like I suffer from burnout and anxiety that affected my grades throughout school and has ultimately made learning harder. How to recover from this?,"I am a faculty member with ADHD who struggles--at times severely--with imposter syndrome. So, here's a game that my therapist and I play sometimes--let's say your *big fear* is that you are not as smart as your peers.  


Let's, for the sake of the game, assume that *this is true.* Let's say that you are *actually not as smart as your peers.* Now, let's try to pick that idea apart.  


Why is this a problem? Why does this bum you out so much? Is it just a blow to your ego? If so, why are you *worried about it?* 

  
There will be many, many situations in which you will NOT be the smartest person in the room, and that's a good thing, because it means you have opportunities to learn from the people around you. It gives you an aspirational goal, and also the chance to figure out what they are doing or thinking about differently than yourself. Take advantage of this. Ask them for advice. It *seems* like this will make you curl up and die with shame, BUT! In my experience, revealing to someone you admire that you're struggling and would love their advice can actually feel like an enormous relief, and also they usually appreciate it as the enormous compliment it is.  


Do you believe that intelligence is static? How do you define ""smart""? Is it momentary and situational? Clearly, you are capable of working through the material and learning from it. You *know and understand* far more now, I am certain, than you did 10 years ago.  You've gotten through *two advanced degrees*. Do you know what a small minority of the global population that puts you into? Who, exactly, do you need to feel smarter than to be OK with what you've accomplished? What will it take?    


Does it feel unfair to you that you have to work harder at things than others? It IS unfair! It DOES suck! But here's what the easy ride gets folks--they don't get the gauntlet experience. They don't learn how to slog. They don't develop the tenacity of experience that you can only really get from trying your fucking hardest, coming up short, and then *showing up the next day to try again.*    
My husband was a slogger. Now that he's not in school, and is out actually working in his field, he is consistently praised for his ability to pinpoint what he doesn't know, and figure out how to learn it. He's a harder worker than others at his firm, and it gets him noticed. He's more critical of his own work, which means he *consistently produced better work than his peers.* He was never the top student in any class he took in undergrad or for his masters, but he is really, really, really good at what he does. He actually complained to me recently that he worked his *ass* off in school, and literally no employer since he graduated has asked him about his GPA.  


It also sounds like you have bought into the myth that tests are an accurate and objective way to measure knowledge of a subject--we know for a *fact* that they are not. We know for a *fact* that things like anxiety are not only disruptive to the studying, but also to the actual experience of being able to make good use of your working memory to recall information that you *know you know.*  It is ok to be bad at taking tests. This is not an accurate measure of your intelligence.   


When I practiced investing less energy into figuring out whether or not I am *actually* smart, I learned to be more comfortable living in this body, with this brain. This is the only brain I'll get. It has some wiring issues. It makes things harder than they need to be sometimes, and that sucks, BUT! It has also been, overall, a really good brain. Maybe it doesn't matter if I'm as smart as or smarter than my colleagues. Maybe the fact that I am *here* is proof that I am ""good enough,"" and maybe I can thrive in ""good enough"" and keep learning not because I have something to prove, but just because I'm curious and I love it.  


&#x200B;"
243,AskAcademia,What are the negative things in the academia that a person should be aware of?,"There are many things of course and everyone’s experience will be different. I will just list below some of my own experiences.

Personally, I suffered from the great power imbalance between supervisor and student. Our PI would just berate us in front of the whole group if he thought we didn’t do something well enough and there was not much one could do about this. Several other PIs saw how he behaved towards us and said nothing. I even complained to my second advisor who then offered to sit in for all our meetings together with my PI. This helped me a lot but it is not a proper fix. Personally I think my PI has too many personality issues to be allowed to supervise students. Universities in my experience won’t fire such people and you also can’t really afford to fight back because you will need professional references later on (I really hate this reference system).

In my field (computer vision) there is a lot of hype following, many people tend to jump on the bandwagon of the latest thing that is in fashion at the moment. There is also a sense of arrogance around this and people will look down on you if you are working on methods that are perceived as more classical or not choosing to implement the latest hyped method (which may even be very computationally expensive or not that much better performance-wise to what already exists).

I also felt that I had to oversell my results and I couldn’t be too honest about the limitations of my methodological contributions. This is because we are essentially expected to publish papers and in order to get a paper accepted by a reviewer I felt like I had to hide certain faults of the method. I feel this is a general problem of my field, most methods when replicated by others perform much much worse compared to what the paper stated. 

The work-life balance can be pretty bad if you don’t keep it in check and this is because there is basically no end to what you could achieve. You could always publish more, do more outreach, etc, so you have to be careful with how much work you sign up for.

The work itself can be pretty isolating as you tend to specialise in something very niche. After a point, nobody in the lab will be able to help you with the technical stuff, including your PI. This can be pretty dangerous if you happen to get stuck in a technical issue. Personally I would drop a project if I couldn’t make progress after 3-4 months at most of getting stuck with it. This is because I would start to feel bad about my progress, which in turn would make me not want to work on it, which then would make me feel bad again. I would get into this weird psychological cycle and for me the most effective thing would be to just cut my losses and drop the project after a certain amount of time of being stuck with it.

Finally, the issue that made me give up and leave for industry is that I felt like I had to squabble for credit a lot. I would have hoped to find a lab where I could collaborate on projects on equal footing with my colleagues. I never got to experience this, in all labs there was someone who wanted to put themselves above the rest and would try to take credit for other people’s work. I felt like I constantly had to look over my shoulder to not get excluded from papers or projects that I worked on, which in the end became too much of a mental effort for me and I decided it was not worth it. 

I hope this all doesn’t sound too daunting, I also wanted to say that I did get a lot out of the experience too: I got to work with highly specialised equipment that otherwise I would never get access to, I got to travel internationally for conferences and I also made many close friends, as most of your colleagues will be in a similar age group and life stage as you, so you easily bond over this experience. So I wish you all the best in your journey!"
244,AskAcademia,For Those on the Academic Job Market This Year: How is it Going?,"First year on the market, have already successfully defended for my PhD, and I already have my JD.  I'm an interdisciplinary scholar, and I've applied to basically everything for which I am qualified.  I am up to 106 applications, with 32 rejections.  I had three first-round interviews, but I got rejections after.  I requested feedback, and I was repeatedly told that my CV is strong, my interview performance is good, but the market is killing me.  For one entry-level position, the committee head told me they decided not to go entry-level at all, and that I was competing with full professors with 10+ years of experience.  At least a couple positions were canceled due to lack of funding, and I get the sense that several positions are waiting to do interviews until they know whether they will be able to hire anyone."
245,AskAcademia,How to become better at talking in academic settings?,"Practice. I'm a very introverted loner, so I get where you're coming from, unfortunately I don't think there's a magic solution you've basically just got to force yourself to do it and gradually it does get easier.

1. Very few people will be offended if you don't already know who they are (and those who do aren't worth worrying about *everyone* thinks they're an arsehole).
2. Again, practice, I've found that mentally repeating someones name 10 or so times really helps remember their name, similarly look them up on LinkedIn (helps if you swap cards)
3. this is something that'll develop overtime, a 1st year PhD probably doesn't have a huge amount to contribute to a conversation, but there's two things here, a) you can talk small talk (hows the conference etc b) let them talk, ask them questions, academics love to talk about ourselves
4. conversations do peter out, so if you feel that happening close out and go ""it was nice to meet/talk to you I need to go to \[next meeting/session/lunch\] etc""

Also make use of 'friendly' sessions, if your department has weekly research meetings, go to them, talk to people, do outreach events etc"
246,AskAcademia,"Research ""Penpal""?",Upvote! I think this is a really cool idea. It would be awesome
247,AskAcademia,Wife's advisor is telling her what and who to include in acknowledgements?,"I suspect the professor is mistaking their idiosyncratic preference for a professional norm. If your wife is worried about it, she might wait to insert the full acknowledgements until the final post-defense version that gets sent for print."
248,AskAcademia,What do faculty members expect when meeting with a potential graduate student?,"From my experience as a prospect PhD candidate and interviewing incoming PhD candidates, generally the main thing the faculty members look for is a fit - is your research style in line with theirs ( independent or do you require constant supervision)? Are you a weirdo? General vibes. 

After chatting about your background and general interest, they may introduce a project to you to see whether or not you'd like it. Eventhough this can be one of many project you work on throughout the years, it should be your deciding factor (in my opinion) to join a lab or not. Your starting project will definitely set the tone of your PhD career and usually subsequent projects will be around the same concept so choose wisely!"
249,AskAcademia,Why Don't Other Disciplines do Open Access?,"Linguistics is an interesting case. Most of the older journals (Language, Linguistic Inquiry, Natural Language and Linguistic Theory) aren't open access, though authors can pay a few hundred dollars to make their works open access (many institutions subsidize this, especially in Europe, but most in the US don't). There is an important new journal that's taking the field by storm though. It's called Glossa, and it was formed after a rift between Elsevier and the editorial board, largely over open access issues. The entire editorial board left and were funding by the Dutch government to start Glossa, which is totally open access and online. The are also famous for a very quick turn around and excellent editorial oversight - whereas most journals take \~6-12 months for reviews, Glossa does it in days. I think most people agree that the field is moving towards a model like Glossa, with other journals, notably Linguistic Inquiry published by MIT Press, slowly moving towards more open models.  


Edit: The editorial board that founded Glossa were previously with a journal called Lingua. The journal is still in operation, but the editorial board is very lax and now only publishes work of highly questionable scientific rigor, as more serious, scientific authors have boycotted them. Its current manifestation is called ""Zombie Lingua."""
250,AskAcademia,"My classmate has clearly plagarised my work, should I report them to my professor?",Report it now. You'll get in more trouble if they have to call you in to discover who did what.
251,AskAcademia,Can I just vent about the whole recommendation letter system based on invitation?,"It does really suck for returning students. I can understand needing a lot of letters for PhD admission, but if you’re applying to something like a taught Masters, you’ve come out of the workforce, and you intend to go back into the workforce afterwards, maybe a bit more flexibility and adherence to industry standards is needed. 

It makes sense that the letter writers should be sending the letters - if they know the student will read their letter they may be pressured to lie in it, or to be more positive than normal. People shouldn’t agree to write if they can’t write a positive letter (and usually won’t agree), but there’s a big difference between “generically positive” and “glowing”. Also prevents tampering or falsification by the student - it’s easy to get a university’s letterhead and no one actually checks signatures. 

A better system would be a centralised platform where writers can upload just one letter and it can be sent off to all the institutions you apply to. In many cases the only difference between letters is the name of the uni anyway, so they may as well be generic. But obviously programs don’t want to do this because they want control over what they ask recommenders."
252,AskAcademia,Does anyone have any positive experiences of getting a PhD and working in academia?,"I work at a tiny liberal arts college, and I love it. I’m absurdly underpaid, but I live simply and what I make is enough for the bills and a decent retirement. Best of all, I genuinely look forward to getting to work every morning, and lots of my former students morph into (admittedly far flung) friends. It’s a good life."
253,AskAcademia,"Love research, love the culture in academia; Hate teaching - is there a place for me?","Maybe you can angle for a position that only teaches grad-level classes. I've met some professors that are well-regarded enough by their institution that they've managed to negotiate that. And I've heard from them that it's far less frustrating than teaching undergrads, especially at a large public school. And grad students tend to want to participate in research, so you might be able to even orient your student interaction around your own research."
254,AskAcademia,Got invited for a phone interview for TT position! What should I prepare?,"Woohoo!!!

From an R1 / research-intensive institution perspective:

Prep for the main questions:
1) tell us about yourself
2) tell us about your research
3) where do you see your research going in the next 5-10 years
4) where will your funding come from
5) what areas/classes can you teach (bonus points if you can name course numbers at their institution); they may also ask a course you could develop to add to their offerings
6) why this institution/dept?

Have short answers for each that convey you are great and well-prepared for the job (which you likely are). They may ask other questions, but those tend to be the most common. 

Then strategically think about questions to ask them that convey you are intentional about launching your research program (and aren’t easily google-able)

Eg can you tell me about mentoring for junior faculty? how would you describe the culture in the department? How does the PhD student-advisor match work? What does a successful junior faculty member look like in this dept?

Don’t: negotiate at this stage or be long-winded

Best wishes!!!"
255,AskAcademia,Ridiculous Academic Pet Names?,Not exactly fitting but I did have a dog named Indiana Bones.
256,AskAcademia,Is PhD regret a thing?,"For me yes, I spent about four years getting this degree and others in my field spent four years progressing in the practical field. They are more established and made a name for themselves. The expectations of a postdoc as well being being treated poorly really made me feel a bit of regret. Not to put you off it, I also think it depends on the group and support you get during your PhD. I was left to do things on my own with very little guidance so I felt so lost during the whole thing, I couldn’t believe I finished the when I did. There were a lot of tears throughout the whole thing, and even when I last amended my thesis! I never felt like I had direction and somehow mustered up a thesis."
257,AskAcademia,How do I come up with a research topic for my PhD?,"Try to catch up on the recent literature on that topic. You'll quickly recognize gaps in the knowledge, sometimes they're even pointed out directly by the authors 'xyz is currently understudied', 'this is not yet well understood', 'more research is needed on this'"
258,AskAcademia,Applying for TT jobs and can't get a letter from my grad school advisor - how to deal?,"You are best having a letters from people who are going to write strong letters, and not a bad letter from your former advisor just because they were your advisor.

This is the kind of thing that another letter writer might sensitively describe in their letter (and something to potentially talk about with a trusted letter writer). If you are openly trans in your application materials, the letter writer may be able to clearly state that your advisor discriminated against you when you came out; if you are not openly trans in your materials, a letter writer may still be able to note that there was a pattern of misbehavior on the part of the advisor thus no letter from them while also highlighting that you are a person who interpersonally is easy to get along with, etc.

My instinct (with the caveat that I haven't been in this or a similar situation) is not to mention it in your cover letter. In general, I think that mentioning any interpersonal challenges--even ones that are clearly not your fault like this one--has the potential to be read the wrong way by the committee, or even sound like excuse making. Instead, highlight your strengths--of which it sounds like you have many--and you can answer the question in a concise and professional way if asked in an interview. Other than that, let a letter writer go to bat for you--it will come across stronger / in a more sympathetic light if it comes from them.

I'm sorry that you are in this position. I wish you all of the best with your applications!"
259,AskAcademia,Is it normal to still make silly mistakes as a postdoc?,"Everyone makes mistakes and this one wasn’t a big one, but they can have serious consequences and the key is to develop processes and procedures so that they do not happen.  This is a new area for you and you are going to make some mistakes.  The right question now is how you are going to ensure that this one never happens again."
260,AskAcademia,"How bad is it to be a ""Jack of all trades"" in academia?","So long as you can spin a yarn about how some top-level theoretic perspective ties together all your work you're fine.

If you can't do that - find a way to do it."
261,AskAcademia,"I tried to bring my research to wider public, but instead I was ridiculed by several high profile academics, in public. How should I deal with this situation?","> But then some high profile academics, actively tweeting, also got some words on my article. They're not in my field, but they're like celebrity academics here.

In that case, they're still just twitter randos. If your work was widely criticised by academics in a conference on your field then that's different. Those are the people you need to impress.

Keep in mind that even in a politically neutral field like astronomy we get this sort of nonsense going on the comment section. This is just what the public act like, especially on the internet, and especially on twitter.

Honestly, I would see this as a positive thing, in terms of your career. You have reached out and made a real effort on public engagement that has made a genuine impression. The fact that the response is so negative (although it might be good to check through the responses to genuinely count how many are positive and how many are negative - we tend to count negative comments more than positive ones) actually highlights the importance of your research."
262,AskAcademia,How can I close the gap in my statistics knowledge?,Pick 1-3 skills you want to learn and think of a project you can apply those skills to. Just going through a textbook won’t make it stick.
263,AskAcademia,"This might sound really stupid, but can I still submit abstracts to conferences call for papers after graduating and no longer being a graduate student?","Go for it.

There's usually no requirement that you have a current university affiliation in order to present at a conference. It's not extremely common for a variety of reasons, but people do present papers and publish as ""independent scholars""."
264,AskAcademia,"Who decides when a PhD student is ready to graduate? The PI, the thesis committee, university policy?","I would say that realizing that you are done, and making this clear to your PI, is a part of the process. There will always be one more experiment, but you need to be able to both realize that it's time to write it up and negotiating this with your professor."
265,AskAcademia,Completing PhD in 3-4 years?,"- They have a well-defined research plan that's approved by their advisor and committee in the early stages.
- Their work doesn't involve making new tools (e.g., they're applying an existing computational or bench technique to a new material or sample).
- They start doing real experiments while taking their core classes, possibly because they're very quick or are otherwise well prepared (e.g., they received strong coverage in undergrad).
- They either aren't very curious about their technique and results or they resist this curiosity and avoid doing a lot of characterization and blue-sky experiments.
- They get lucky with their results or are able to convincingly identify the successful aspects of their failures.
- They write the papers and make the figures as they do the experiments. They use the papers as chapters of their thesis, adding only introduction and conclusion chapters.
- They assertively manage their advisors to review manuscripts quickly and to not ratchet up expectations.
- They have one or more committee members who apply pressure on the advisor if necessary not to delay the defense.

(Coming from someone who took 5 1/2 years but had a few very disciplined colleagues.)

EDIT: This seemed to click with a lot of people, so I wanted to add a few more shared characteristics of the individuals I worked with:

- They had a concrete plan for their career for after graduation; grad school was a means to an end and not a space for exploration.
- They had a limited tolerance for ""what-if"" discussions and mostly wanted to get back into the lab and work.
- They didn't necessarily have the most supportive advisor but did know what levers to pull to move forward (e.g., different adversarial styles or networking to pull in high-clout individuals to support them against the advisor).
- They didn't necessarily feel that they were very smart, but they did feel that they could attack any challenge and prevail. They didn't get sidetracked long by an experiment going wrong or a piece of equipment not working; that would certainly be on the top of their mind until they addressed the issue, but it wouldn't shake their confidence in their research. They weren't overly confident or egotistical in their progress or successes either. In other words, they weren't married to their research; they just *did the work every day* as the units of progress accumulated.

So: dispassionate, tenacious, steely, organized, savvy, and lucky."
266,AskAcademia,Has anyone here NOT had significant issues completing their PhD?,"All went well for me. Had a supportive advisor, a great stipend, finished in time, had fun and got a good postdoc afterwards. Went to a bunch of conferences with financial support either from the university or from being invited, published some papers during my PhD, still have several half finished papers left.
I did my PhD in history at a university in Central Europe."
267,AskAcademia,Student cheating with homework – how to handle the situation?,"Well, for one thing, I would recommend not calling students out in front of other students.  It’s hard to see what this will accomplish that can’t be better accomplished by talking to the accused students in private in conjunction with offering a general reminder to the class that doesn’t involve public shaming."
268,AskAcademia,Is it really awkward or unusual for someone outside academia to attend an academic conference?,Literally no one would know so how could it be awkward or gauche? I do think it would not be worth the money though. I would recommend taking MOOCs on topics that interest you instead of going to a conference where the information may be presented with an assumption that attendees have graduate training in the subject.
269,AskAcademia,Is Academia really as bad as it can be made out to be?,"We mostly come here to whine and seek advice when in trouble, like others have said, don't take what you see here as our daily life.

If you are interested, I'd say pursue a master's, its 1 or 2 years (depending on where you do it), you'll get to do research, the skills can be easily transferable to regular jobs, and you'll be able to decide if you want more or not.

I decided to pursue my PhD with the certainty that I want to do science until I grow old and retire. I really like what I do. However, as years passed, and this is my 6th year in academia (2y masters, 4y phd), I now that I want stability and comfort more than I love science. My area, unfortunately, does not have as many options as in the past, plus there is zero possibility of me finding a research-only position, everything is mostly focused on teaching, which I really dislike. This made me ""broaden my view"", and I started to look ""the other world"", of regular jobs, industry and whatever.

Basically, this rambling is more to say that No, life isn't as bad as it seems, and Yes, you might enter a MSc. or a PhD and you might change your mind due to whatever reason, and that's okay too, won't mean that your MSc. or PhD was a complete waste of time/money, really."
270,AskAcademia,Is there a term for this?,"Is ""daisy-chaining the grants"" an okay phrase?

I think even describing some results as coming through ""a cycle of grants"" is okay.

I'd ask as much whether it's ethical for funders to expect so much unfunded preliminary data as it is for researchers to use box 2 for their grant funding / results discovery. 

I'd also think the standard practice (and related ethics) varies a lot based on whether this is for discovery science or for a contract to achieve a specific task."
271,AskAcademia,Does anyone know any case of a PhD student that failed their PhD defense? If yes why and what happened next?,"I know of two cases. 

One was just egregious. No way should this person have ever passed or even got that far. He was an older gentleman trying to get a PhD in Physics. His dissertation was two pages long, full of erroneous assumptions, and contained no real original work. He failed and left the program. 

A second one I know of didn’t pass but didn’t “fail.”  They required him to make serious changes and defend again."
272,AskAcademia,Got a call from a prof about how unhappy he was with my performance...how screwed am I?,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're majorly jumping the gun. Your prof shouldn't have handled it like this over a call but what's done is done. 

Ideally, he should be looking to give you feedback with the expectation you'll improve and then come back to review. 

You need to meet with him and hear him out. Do not say anything about quitting or failing, you'll just be making it worse and putting words in his mouth. Let him do the talking, and try not to hear the worst possible interpretation of what he's saying and also don't take it as an assessment of you as a person. We all screw up at some point, the key is being open to the feedback and willing and able to change. 

Assuming there hasn't been a discussion before this about your overall performance (as opposed to occasionally pointing out a mistake), this should be an opportunity to assess the overall situation and make a plan for improvement. If there has already been a discussion then this is more serious.

Don't quit without at least getting a clear understanding of the situation, and if they're happy for you to continue don't beat yourself up and convince yourself you should leave."
273,AskAcademia,Me and my friend did a project as a team. He now wants to write my half of the project in his master's thesis as well. Should I allow him to?,"Speaking as a CS professor, the answer is ""Of course not."" Even if you agreed to this, his Master's thesis must be his own work. Since you co-authored a paper, it has already been documented that your contributions were  enough to merit more than acknowledgement. He cannot include your work in his Master's thesis unless he very clearly documents that it was your work and not his, the same way he would with any other citations to work by others, which is apparently not what he wants to do. It seems pretty clear that he is trying to cheat, and you should not support that.

He is also being dishonest when he says that this would benefit you. Nobody cares about the acknowledgments in a Master's thesis. It is also untrue that you will be unable to write about your portion in your own hypothetical Master's thesis in the future, although it is perhaps unlikely that you will want to do so."
274,AskAcademia,University surveying whether to go pass/fail. What are the benefits for students? What are the risks?,"Ours went this way: students have one week after getting their final (A-F) grades to decide whether to turn them into P/F grades. If they decide to do P/F, the course still counts as a requirement for majors, but does not contribute to their GPA. This is all mandated from above so professors don't have to choose anything.

I think this splits the difference somewhat nicely. It's basically saying, ""courses are still real courses,"" but ""if you don't do as well as you'd hoped, you can make the course not count towards your GPA, but still get graduation credit for it."" I also am glad it doesn't make me pick; I'm not the good guy or the bad guy here.

The students, if the Reddit forum for our university is to be trusted, seem to like this option as well.

(I've talked to my own students about this, most seem very happy with it. My honors freshmen worried a little that this will require explanation for grad or med school admissions but I've assured them that the admissions people are going to understand that this was a weird semester and they'll hardly be the only ones in this situation.)"
275,AskAcademia,"As a felon, should I apply for a lab job?","It's going to come up, whether you pursue a position there now or any time in the future. Especially if you go to grad school and may teach undergrads who may be minors. And unfortunately that barrier will stay with you as you progress and encounter stricter requirements up the ladder.

I looked up the policy at my institution and negative background check results are handled on a case-by-case basis, considering the nature of the offense, its relationship to the position, and time/rehabilitation. You just have to be up front about it when filling out any hiring paperwork, and keep your expectations in check just in case. It'll either work out or it won't, all you can do is try.

I would personally not have any problem hiring a former felon if they are honest, enthusiastic and work hard (my expectations for anyone), but I'm not sure how my institution would feel. Good luck."
276,AskAcademia,"Can academia encourage bizarre job expectations, even for Doctors?","I'm in academia (professor). To answer your question: ***unfortunately, yes***. The main issue here is a conflict between two facts:

1. People who want to be in academia ***really do*** want it; they love it; it's a professional dream; it's a very fulfilling career, and, in many (albeit not all) cases, it does pay well and it does offer benefits that very few people have these days (stability being a big one).
2. There are so few jobs in academia that at most 10% of PhDs will end up in a permanent position (tenure-track professor). So a PhD is often a *very risky* bet professionally speaking.

It's very difficult to resolve the conflict above. Cognitive dissonance is very common in these scenarios. We tell ourselves ""my CV is better than average, so *I* will get a position""; or ""but I have a PhD from XXX university, and everyone knows it!""; or ""if Bob got one, I will surely get one too"". None of this works, because luck, it turns out, plays a major role—and we typically ignore this variable. There's always one more year you can try and apply for academic jobs, after all. I was extremely lucky, but I've known people in their 40s who are still trying. No savings, no retirement plan, no comfort... it's a very sad situation to work for many years and just not get what you want the most.

To make things worse, ***for many areas***, an academic job is one of *the only* actually good professional paths if you have a PhD. Any alternative will likely mean (a) you won't be paid as much or (b) you will be overqualified and probably unhappy given (1) above. What I mean is this: if you have a PhD in chemistry or computer science, academia is *one* option—but it's not the only one and not even the best one salary-wise. If, on the other hand, you're in philosophy, what **are** the other options? Even in my field, linguistics, which does have a reasonable number of alternatives, very few of those come close to what academia can offer *assuming you land a good and permanent academic job*. Sure, you can work for Google or Apple, but seriously, how many linguistics PhDs will actually get *those* jobs...? Very few.

So, the sad reality is that anyone pursuing an academic career in the humanities is investing years into something that has a high chance of not working out in the end. I can't stress how frustrating and psychologically shitty this is. Once you go down the rabbit hole, years of grad school and hard work, it's extremely difficult to convince yourself you need to change course."
277,AskAcademia,Planning to leave academia after getting my PhD - how to overcome guilt and lack of motivation?,"I think you need to reframe the situation.

You’re not leaving because of any personal failure to “handle it”. You’re leaving because academia is not putting a competitive offer (for postdoc, for a career) on the table. 

It’s the employer’s responsibility to offer benefits to make their job posting a competitive choice. Academia has not managed to do this, at least not for you and many others. The benefits being offered are not good enough for the work that’s required. Maybe if the job were better, you might take it. But it isn’t better. 

The ball is in their court.

As for your guilt, I think it’s the department’s own fault if they set the minimum standard too low. A lot of PhD programmes have shockingly low standards if you only look at what is strictly required for the thesis. People tend to do more because they’re chasing that academic career, but if that isn’t you, the wiser thing would be to spend your extra time making yourself more employable generally. Businesses can flop so you don’t want that to be your only option. Getting some extra (minor) qualifications in relevant areas or doing an industry internship would be a good idea.

And as to whether or not you should quit: a PhD is a very rare opportunity to improve yourself and your employable skills without having a gap on your CV. You’re free to structure your time as you see fit, and since the minimum standard is so low, you can have a lot of free time. You leave with a qualification *and* you have the freedom to focus on other things. So unless you’re really suffering, I think it’s absolutely worth a couple of years of “meh” to stick it out."
278,AskAcademia,"Why do we continue to give high-stakes tests, especially when they are counter-productive to both students and professors?","The language around high stakes testing didn't originate around finals, but rather achievement/qualifying exams like the SAT, ACT, and GRE.

Midterms and Finals in college courses are excellent assessments but not the totality of assessment. When paired with other forms of assessment and designed well, they offer a way to gauge student performance in one of the environments best suited to mitigate cheating.

For that reason, they are unlikely to ever go away."
279,AskAcademia,"Assaulted in the office, is it a good idea ever to mention this?","What the actual fuck?????

Yes. This is terrible. Report the incident. Talk to the person with the most seniority in the department/program/university that you trust to be your advocate. This kind of behavior absolutely should not be tolerated."
280,AskAcademia,Is it realistic to want to be interdisciplinary?,"Being a 16th or 17th century style polymath is difficult to impossible, but interdisciplinary studies are basically required at this point. Where do you draw the line between compsci, biology, and chemistry in genetics? Where is the line between biology, chemistry, and psychology when you're working in neuroscience? Toss in some physics for flavoring when you're talking about acoustics, or fMRI, or..."
281,AskAcademia,Professor I am interested in working with has only ever worked with Chinese students and researchers. Is this a red flag?,"You may be overthinking this: if you're interested in his work, contact him and let him ignore you or turn you down.  Currently the Chinese government funds a bunch of students, which makes them a lot cheaper for PI's. If you do get an interview, though, talk to his current lab and see if it's one you'd like to join."
282,AskAcademia,Do others have a very hard time staying focused during talks/conference lectures?,"I only pay attention to about 10% of the talks at any given conference.  For the other 90%, I either (1) understand the result as well as care to, (2) maybe have one question about it that will be addressed in the first 5 minutes of the talk, or (3) just don't care."
283,AskAcademia,How do I best support my daughter through grad school?,"-Unexpected cair packages with nostalgic treats etc. 

-Don't ask how the manuscript is coming. (It's always behind.) 

My mom did both. The first one really helped and the second one added to my stress lol."
284,AskAcademia,How can I support my anxious and stressed out PI?,"Early in my career I struggled with anxiety, too. I've heard it's fairly common.

There's an appropriate level of concern and support. If you're the grad student, you shouldn't cross it. If you two had never talked about anything like this, it would be too much to suggest professional help. It's never bad to affirming and supportive. 

I have a colleague who pokes her head into my office fairly often and asks how I'm doing. Virtually always I say all is well (regardless of the truth). She does the same when I pop in. A couple of times one of us was support for the other when we really needed it.

In academics, the judgment for promotion and tenure is so subjective, it is perilous to have a weakness that's known about, even on things that shouldn't be perceived as a weakness (sexuality, disability, etc.). If someone opens up to you, do NOT out them."
285,AskAcademia,How do I tell my supervisor I want to do a PhD somewhere else?,"I broke the news to my advisor last week. They took it very personally. Even though I have not yet graduated, I have been cut from all meetings and I'm not allowed in the lab. In fact, I have zero interaction. If he could fire me, it would look exactly like this. I am also not gonna be able to secure a reference letter from him for PhD applications.

So, my advice, be very careful and don't give him any excuse. Break the news to him very carefully. Ultimately, it's your life and you should make the decisions."
286,AskAcademia,Transgender in academia?,"If you plan on changing your name, do it before your publish your first paper. You will want to have a consistent name in your publication history."
287,AskAcademia,"A professor told me, ""The worst aspects of academia are really dark."" What are they?","Academia has many wonderful points, but there is a recurrent dark theme, which is people sometimes feel trapped. Stuck in a bad advisor relationship, isolated in a small town, forced to work with toxic colleagues, and so on. People often see an academic job as a calling—so they stay even in bad circumstances—and feel they have no other options. It's also a world where reputation matters intensely, so it can feel hard to make changes that ruffle feathers.

Most of industry is far more fluid. It's easier to change jobs, and often positions are more plentiful. But there are niches (Hollywood, symphonies, video game development, etc.) that I think have the same problems, for some of the same reasons. I think the smaller and more ""elite"" a community you're in, the easier it is to feel trapped.

I don't know any magic formula for dealing with this. One tactic I've seen help is, when making career choices, to try very hard to weight your future happiness over considerations of prestige. (Easier said than done, if prestige makes you happy—but try anyway.) Another is to talk to your colleagues, and not keep stress within yourself. You often have more options than you realize, and other people can help you find them."
288,AskAcademia,My supervisor’s reaction to me giving up on my PhD application hurt me… Any advices?,"I believe the point he is making is not that one less position will be awarded, but that he is missing out on potentially being awarded a PhD student. If he supported another candidate there was a possibility of a student joining the group, and now the chance is zero.
It's quite possible you've just burnt bridges with that supervisor/group."
289,AskAcademia,Giddy about introducing my mentor. Advice please?,"This is so wholesome! Can you talk about his skills as a mentor rather than a researcher, maybe a related anecdote? That's something personal that not many people would know about"
290,AskAcademia,I just found out spousal hires are a thing - can people share their experiences?,"At my R1 this is discussed in faculty meeting during hiring deliberations fairly regularly. Certainly by the second visit. We are in a college town and there aren’t that many opportunities in the immediate vicinity outside our institution - especially academic ones. So realistically, either you are going to make someone an offer they are unlikely to be able to accept - certainly not long term, unless the partner is willing to commute over an hour each way to nearby larger cities - or you find ways to hire both parties in a couple. They have to stand on their own merits - often a problem when one outclasses the other - but we coordinate across departments and/or other units to try and make something happen. 

It doesn’t always work, but it’s narrow-minded to expect that a candidate walks in as an untethered individual with no personal ties and requirements. Also, slots have a habit of evaporating if you don’t fill them when they are available, so it’s in the department’s best interest to consider candidates’ partners as part of the picture. This doesn’t mean co-hires or exceptions to requirements."
291,AskAcademia,Does ridicule of humanities research/students bleed over to professional academia?,"I'm in a department that has both scientists and humanists. I've never seen anything egregious, but I've seen dismissal and misconceptions going both ways."
292,AskAcademia,Should prof intervene with sexism between students?," I wish you would have communicated with the prof before you dropped the class.

Of course he should have talked with the young man. I think the instructor has an obligation to help students learn to work respectfully with others--male or female.

Since you've already communicated with the instructor and he agreed with you about the young man treating you differently and poorly but he either wasn't interested or able to do anything about it, I think you need to go upstairs. I was a chair and I would want to know about this. Since there is chat evidence of how the student treated you, I'd have a conversation with the young man about appropriate and inappropriate behavior toward other students. I'd also have a conversation with the adjunct about his response to you and point out to him that if he didn't think he was able to deal with a disruptive student he could always talk with me and I'd help him out. I'd also point out that positive student evaluations don't trump expectations about his professional behavior. If it was the first time this kind of thing happened, I'd likely continue to hire him but if it occurred before, we'd be done. This is one reason why I'd want to know--to be sure it's not an ongoing pattern of behavior in the adjunct.

I'm sorry this occurred."
293,AskAcademia,I am having an IBS flare and have been asked to attend a 4 day group retreat. What the hell do I do?,"""I am having a flare up of a chronic medical condition that means I will not be able to join you on the retreat. If it is possible to Zoom in to some of the morning presentations, I would be interested in exploring that option. But I hope you all have an excellent time on the retreat!""

Said, or emailed, with a tone that of course this is a perfectly reasonable thing to say (because it is), and of course your PI will understand and not be an ass (because they shouldn't be). You do not have to disclose what the medical issue is. If they express concern, you need to say that you're managing the condition with the help of your doctors, and you appreciate their concern. 

Do not give in to temptations to explain in greater detail. If they pushing, you can offer to get a note from your doctor and work with the accommodations office, but that you're hoping the professor will understand your desire to keep your private medical information private."
294,AskAcademia,"Reviewer pointed out non-existent grammatical mistakes, the best way to respond?","If the reviewer has actually elaborated on why some of the sentences are problematic, you could just easily disprove them, if the used language is indeed correct. If they have just pointed out that there are misuses and errors without giving you specific examples, then you can simply state, for instance: ""We do not understand what the reviewer means by these comments. We have double-checked the manuscript for grammatical errors and have not found the kind of mistakes pointed out in the comment.""

Not every comment warrants an action, especially if the comment in vague or otherwise lacking in quality, which the comment you pointed out sound like.

It would help if you could share the original comment."
295,AskAcademia,How can we make academic conferences affordable and inclusive?,Man...this is great! I had to go across the country to present research and my school didn’t even fund me enough for my plane ticket :/
296,AskAcademia,Why are academics bad at faking data?,"My slightly cynical opinion is that many of the data fraud cases that we know of (Schön and others) are the sloppy ones. The ones that will fake data for huge breakthroughs for Science and Nature articles will get caught, no matter how good their fraud is.

A lot of it comes down to whistleblowers. The clinician-scientist I did my undergrad internship was found guilty of data fraud on a grant application only because a MSc student she *literally asked to make fraudulent data* whistleblew on her after he refused to do it and she did it herself.

The more clever, subtle things? No. A straightforward replication or extension study in a mid-tier journal (IF < 10) is not going to raise scrutiny or eyebrows near as much as novel, high impact research. Check out the response to the room temp superconductor paper. Almost universally the response has been “No, we can’t celebrate this until it can be reliably replicated”. Something that isn’t conceptually novel but moreso just adds to existing evidence isn’t going to be examined with as much criticism as novel work. I’m of the opinion (I could be wrong), a grad student without strict supervision working on comparatively mundane data has a higher chance of getting away with fraud than a Harvard PI a working on novel data. Senior grad students and postdocs are much more familiar with stats and methods, and much closer to the actual data rather than working at a high level. 

I guarantee there is significantly more fraudulent data than we believe. I don’t just mean shifty p-hacking, I mean full on fabrication. In clinical research (my field), institutional QA controls and data inspection do a great job at weeding out bad actors but not perfectly so, obviously."
297,AskAcademia,"I'm a miserable and inadequate PhD student, should I drop out?","You said you were in industry for a couple of years before and were happy doing that, which is great because it means you have some experience and can jump back in. You haven't failed and don't need a PhD to be successful in life."
298,AskAcademia,"When people says they have published in “Nature” do they usually mean the journal or any other journals by the Nature publisher (e.g. Scientific Report, Lab animal, npj Vaccines, etc.)?","Nature is Nature. The other journals (e.g. Scientific Reports and Nature Comms) are **not** Nature. It is completely misleading and pretentious to claim that you have a Nature paper if it is published in a Nature Publishing Group journal other than Nature.

>Are all journals published by Nature highly regarded?

The ones by Nature Partner Journals are average, lower tier to Nature and baby Nature journals."
299,AskAcademia,"Consulting as a side job: how does one track the ""hours""?","Find a system that works for you. For me, I just use a plain old google sheet, and track in 15 min increments. Stuff that takes less than 15 mins (e.g. hopping on a 3 min call with someone), I collate later by looking back at call logs. Also helps for me to go to a physically distinct place (i.e. far enough from where I usually dwell so that it's apparent on a google map), then browse back at my google map activity to fill in any missing gaps. Jotting down notes, researching, etc. I rely on my browser's history. Obviously much better to track everyday, but I accept that's just not going to happen for me, so I might as well get some use out of the constant surveillance we all live under.

Honestly, don't worry about it too much. So long as you're being honest and not looking to cheat hours, you'll end up more or less fine. With my system, I don't think my employer will ever overpay me by more than an hour every month. Of course, I don't know what your hourly rate is so your company might be more meticulous than mine. Hope this helped!"
300,AskAcademia,Another leaving academia post: how to deal with guilt?,"I got into biology because I was good at it at school. No magical moment no exceptional drive to uncover the mystery of nature blah blah. I did my Bachelors and masters and did a PhD kind of because “ everyone did it” after PhD I stumbled across a posting for a postdoc with a quite interesting topic and did that and now work in industry. What I want to say with that it’s totally ok to treat research like an ordinary job. There is nothing special about it if you do not feel special about it and that is totally fine. Academia conditions you to believe that you “sacrifice for humanity” and that “basis research is the only true calling”.
Do what you enjoy in the best way you like it. F*** everything else. It’s fair to change what you want to do in life and real friends will support you in that"
301,AskAcademia,Why finding academic jobs is more difficult today compared to how it used to be?,"Many things, as other already mentioned. The management is also interested in having temporary/adjunct staff because they can be controlled much easier. Firing a tenured professor is difficult, with an adjunct, you simply don't extend the contract. Problem is that many incompetent people got tenure back in the day and they are still running the show."
302,AskAcademia,Harvard RAship offer recinded at the last moment. What to do?,That’s insane and Harvard should be held responsible for it. They have to be able to find you a different RA job. You must have received a DS2019 from them?! How can they rescind after all that. Get in touch with the international office and maybe the ombudsman. You could also try to reach out to their graduate student union. They may not be able to help you directly but are probably clued up on who you should contact.
303,AskAcademia,Should someone with an honorary doctorate be addressed as 'Dr.'?,"No. Generally they don't expect to be, either."
304,AskAcademia,Does the professor-student relationship ever end?,"Once a student is well out of school and one's influence then the power relationship is effectively not that big a deal. I don't have a problem being friends with some former students (but there have only been a few that I would consider to be real ""friends"" as opposed to just ""former students""), and I consider myself ""friends"" with a few of my former professors, even from undergrad (and would feel comfortable talking with them about personal things, etc.). But time, in general, makes this more feasible: as the student ages and is less in a position of potential vulnerability, it becomes for more plausible."
305,AskAcademia,What are faith/religious based universities in the US actually like?,"There's definitely a spectrum.  The university I attended might have been like that in the 1950s (required going to church on Sundays) but now only has loose ties with the church and had chaplains for Christian, Jewish, and Muslim students available.  Definitely didn't require letters from anyone like that.  I guess I'm saying that if the only thing you see is that they are affiliated with a church, it very well might be a negligible or historical religious affiliation.  If letters of rec are required it is probably a different story."
306,AskAcademia,Is it just me or does everything go really slowly in academia ?,Not as slow as government labs.
307,AskAcademia,A PhD Program posted the wrong deadline on their website. They won't consider my application after I missed the true deadline. Do I have options?,"If they fuck up a simple deadline and are dicks about it now, how are they going to be when they fuck up a bigger deadline (Thesis submission date to graduate w/o paying for another semester, etc). I'd take it as a sign that this program isn't running well or doesn't care to run well.

308,AskAcademia,How common is it for people not to publish academic research because it didn't come to the wanted conclusion?,"Look up ""positive publication bias"". There is a strong incentive to publish only positive and novel results, which is distorts the true reality of research: many experiments ""fail"" and many experiments are confirmatory. 

This is a problem as then almost any positive result is spun to be hugely important despite a flawed experimental design which makes it highly likely to be spurious."
309,AskAcademia,"Professors who only teach, what's it like to not have research responsibilities?","I have had friends who have done this. Pros are it seems less stressful without research productivity, and it does allow for people who really love teaching to fluorish.

The cons are that teaching-only colleges are likelier to see issues related to funding, as well as the fact that your personal mobility is much less (fewer institutions to move to)."
310,AskAcademia,Help! How do I survive a PhD with chronic fatigue??,"I have chronic fatigue from depression, medicine has helped some…. but I completed an experimental engineering PhD and am now a TT faculty.  You can do it, just work at the times that work for you.  Don’t try to be a 9-5 kind of person."
311,AskAcademia,Why is the english in scam journals so bad?,"Filtering mechanism, if you're desperate enough to ignore the poor English, then you're less likely to waste their time and more likely to give them money.

312,AskAcademia,Why are academic papers so difficult to read?,"(STEM based answer)

I'm currently reviewing a paper using a lot of concepts slightly outside of my area of expertise and I feel you. Some terms need me to read other papers to understand. My usual process involves following the references down several levels and traversing these levels until I understand completely what is being said, it's exhausting.

There is an intense level of detail required in research. While the general points can be given simply, speaking generally can get you in trouble as it introduces ambiguity into what you say. If reviewers misinterpret what you are trying to convey it will be very hard to get published. 

Jargon may seem confusing initially but it is needed to *concisely* describe things. There needs to be a high density of information as authors are not given a lot of space.

There is a difference between broadly understanding what an author is saying and being able to recreate it. I can tell the paper I am looking at now is of sufficient quality as I can recreate the results of the research (theoretical not experimental thankfully). 

The good news is that once you get used to an area is that you can read papers faster as jargon is reused. 

Writing and reading are both difficult and important skills to develop as they form cornerstones of research. Your work doesn't exist in a bubble, it is based on other's research which you must read, and if you want others to appreciate your work then you have to learn to communicate it effectively. It's not easy but it's worth it if that's what you enjoy."
313,AskAcademia,[Meta-ish] Why does everyone say they're in a top ranked university?,Because people like us who went to generic state schools don't mention it in posts
314,AskAcademia,Universities from developing countries are renown abroad?,"Renowned where and how is probably an important aspect of this question. I know about UBA and UNAM but they're not 'well known' at least in the English speaking world, now that might be different in Spain, and its certainly different in Latin America. 

That's not a reason not to go to either of them, they're both well regarded among those who do know of them, and it's not like other countries don't have good universities that are basically unknown outside of their country/region, once you move beyond Oxford/Cambridge and places like LSE people's knowledge of English universities diminish quickly."
315,AskAcademia,How to prepare for a PhD with little experience?,"I did my Bsc, then my MSc, then my PhD, nothing inbetween, my only internship was 2 weeks. I didn't attend any conferences before my PhD and didnt publish anything before the 3rd year of my PhD. 

I think this is pretty much standard, don't worry too much about this."
316,AskAcademia,What separates a great PhD student from a good one?,"From a professor I had: 

A good PhD student does the work, gets the data that the PI asks for, and asks why it went wrong or what to do next. 

A great PhD student asks himself why it went wrong, comes up with potential solutions, and brainstorms with the PI which would be most logical (learning this for himself the thought process to become more and more independent). 

He said professors don't need your hands, they need your brains. "
317,AskAcademia,What kind of CVs are preferred these days---old-style ones with plain typefaces or modern graphic designy ones?,"I recruit for a range of roles including faculty, and while I can't recall seeing a ""modern"" one for faculty it's entirely possible I have. Personally, I don't have any particular preference. However, if you're using graphics it takes a lot more work to do well than an old style CV, and done badly it's definitely detrimental to your application. In addition, this might just be me but I suspect I miss a lot of information on CVs where information is broken up into columns and boxes."
318,AskAcademia,Can an educated patient with a rare disease present and publish self researched interventions?,"Have you, as first author, and your medical team, as co-authors already published a case report in a peer-reviewed journal? Your post appears to indicate that you did so last spring.

If you've already get a paper out, even if it's a case report (that n = 1), then a conference is easier. Read up on the submission guidelines/requirements and prepare an abstract according to the req."
319,AskAcademia,"How ""red flaggy"", for all purposes, are institutions that have a faculty of professors who all have completed their education at the same institution?","Are you saying that University of Example's Department of Hypothetical Studies has almost their entirely faculty that did all their higher ed *at* U of E's Department of Hypothetical Studies? As in, they are graduates of *that* program nigh-exclusively? Or are you saying that they are mostly graduates of the same program as one another, but the program is at a different school?


If the latter, is the other program more prestigious/well-known in the field? 

Most of the faculty at my undergrad did their undergrad at that school and all did their Masters or PhD at the same university elsewhere in the state. This was because most of them grew up in my town, they had to go to a different school for grad school but that was the *one* in-state school with grad programs in our field, and then they came back to be near their family and teach at a school they had good experiences at. That's an example that I don't think is really ""red flaggy"", I went from that undergrad to a top grad school in my field."
320,AskAcademia,anyone have traditions for celebrating their academic successes?,My boyfriend gets a Pizza Hut pizza with all the toppings.

322,AskAcademia,Has anyone heard through the grapevine what the general trend is going to be for colleges requiring the COVID19 vaccine?,"Labor laws apply to employee-employer relationships, so I wouldn't look to that for any indication of what could or will happen.

I would not be surprised if most major universities required proof of vaccination or medical certification that it's a contraindication, at least for students living on campus.

I think smaller conservative private schools won't require it and will use that as a selling point. I could also see far-right legislature/governors forbidding their ""liberal elite"" state schools from requiring it, just to make a political statement.

I could also see a fair number of schools not ""requiring"" it, but still asking for vaccination records, heavily promoting the vaccine at campus health, and juts hoping they end up with herd immunity that way."
323,AskAcademia,Completing a PhD Full-time While Working Part-time: Doable or A Silly Idea for Silly People?,"I'm doing a PhD in Special Education, which is close enough to your fields that I feel alright weighing in.

I've been FT since I started, but a lot of my peers are part-time, taking 1-2 classes at a time while they continue their FT jobs. A few PT students have switched over to FT, and the PTers frequently raise a few issues with their situation, which lead me to recommend against it:

1) Far fewer opportunities to publish, present, and conduct research, since a lot of our opportunity comes from the work we do for our advisors as Grad Assistants.

2) Relative social isolation compared to FT students, especially before COVID. A lot of what I've learned was informal learning from hanging out in the lab with more experienced students, and those relationships have also resulted in more opportunity to collaborate, network, even to find small jobs here and there.

3) Along the same lines, PT students report that they feel like they receive less departmental support. They spend less time with their advisor, have a harder time getting help, etc.

4) It takes a lot longer, which eventually gets to people. Doing a PhD sucks, but at least for FT students it will be over soon. PT students are working more hours (including their FT job) for a longer period with less support. Also take note of the increased burnout and higher likelihood of dropping out.

I wouldn't say it's a ""silly idea for silly people,"" but I would recommend doing your PhD full-time or not at all. It sounds like you've got a good thing going right now. You're happy with your job, and it sounds like you're good at it. There are two kinds of people that I'd recommend do a PhD: people that *absolutely need it* to get their dream job, and those who are so dead-set on getting a PhD that they can't be dissuaded. I'm not sure that you fall into either category. If you really have nothing to lose, you might as well try, but I'd recommend having a Plan B if your first semester/year are unsustainable. Either be ready to commit to the PhD full-time, or be mentally prepared to drop out to prioritize your career."
324,AskAcademia,How/When should I disclose my disability?,"As someone who attended Cambridge as a postgraduate, I don't want to scare you or cause any undue stress, but... proceed with caution.

It is a world class institution in many ways, but also quite behind the times in others, particularly around issues relating to student wellness. (If you're expecting American-style student wellness infrastructure, you'll be sorely disappointed.) 

I would consult with your medical team again. (""My university wasn't very helpful. I'd really appreciate some best practices if you have any."") Maybe they could draw up a simple list of things they'd recommend (""Quiet study space"") on doctor office letterhead and you can provide that to supervisors or whoever.

And reach out to the disabilities office and ask them what specifically they will be able to offer you insofar as remedial assistance. Although I assume their help is pretty much restricted to extra exam time, note-taking assistance, and the like.

The people you'll be interacting with most will mean well. Cambridge is full of lovely people. But the infrastructure isn't always where you'd expect or hope it would be in terms of support. The concept of self-study sort of permeates everything: you're smart enough to get in, and they expect you to be smart enough to solve most your problems yourself (which obviously isn't feasible or realistic in every context).

P.s. Which college? They each have varying levels of facilities -- with more or less space in the libraries depending on which you've landed in."
325,AskAcademia,How do.i go about with dealing with a senile professor?,"If you have a professor taking their pants off in class, you need to go up the chain of command until something is done. I’m astounded that the dept chair seems to be making an excuse for his behavior - not even sending someone to observe a class or two, which would take minimal effort. In my opinion you should go to the Dean now "
326,AskAcademia,How to Detect Papers from Online Essay Mills?,"Realistically, you can't. You could spend an inordinate amount of time stringing together textual analysis that supports your claim, but it won't really go anywhere. A student could be getting help from friends, or outright paying a service to write the essays. They could be utilizing academic support services on your own campus to a considerable degree. Who knows at this point.

The point is that you can't be sure of how they are cheating, or even if they are. I ultimately think you should just give up on those students as it were. Spend your energy on something positive, like helping the students in your courses that need help. 

If you are willing to up-end your course a bit, you can make it much more difficult for these assignments to work. I break my papers up into sections and require in-person peer review for most of the sections to count. A student that can't string together a sentence can't buy their way out of that classwork. My peer reviews total 25 points per paper, so they could squeak by with a C. It's more work, but I think it's also better teaching. 

In short, either ignore it or stop assigning fire and forget essays."
327,AskAcademia,Is it possible to be published even as a non-profesional?,"It's quite possible, it just doesn't tend to happen because the skillset you need to publish you only tend to learn...in academia."
328,AskAcademia,"How do academics become multi-disciplinary, like Chomsky?","I miss the times when mathematics, physics and chemistry were just called ""natural philosophy"" ..."
329,AskAcademia,"The top journal in my field constantly asks me for peer review, at what point is it reasonable to ask for a position on the editorial board? Is that ever even an option?","A couple of thoughts:

* If you review frequently for the journal, then sure, go ahead and ask about the possibility of an editorial board position.  Of course, be sure to phrase your request in very professional and positive terms.  You really respect the journal, it's your go-to place for the latest and greatest in your field, you have reviewed for them frequently in the past, and so forth.  Don't let any hint of the idea come across that this is a quid pro quo situation, i.e., that you've done a lot of review work for them in the past and now you'd like to be rewarded with a position.  In strict numerical terms, the journal has very few editorial board positions but many, many reviewers, even reviewers who review multiple times per year, so in that strictly numerical sense, your situation is likely not special.
* The other point is that, even if it's ok for you to ask about the possibility of an editorial board position, it's another matter entirely as to whether this is a good idea.  You yourself admit that you frequently submit late reviews (the bane of any editorial board member's existence), and so it might be wise to ask whether you truly have the time available in your schedule to serve as an editorial board member, which is a whole new level of work entirely compared to being an ordinary reviewer."
330,AskAcademia,First faculty job offer. How am I supposed to feel?,It's OK to feel tired. But what does it mean really? They don't do tenure? So how many years can you stay there? 
331,AskAcademia,MDPI added to predatory list?,"My recent experience of them was interesting/ frustrating. I was asked by an editor I know to review a paper. I spotted it was MDPI but as I know the editor i accepted.

The paper was well written and well structured but the scientific content was lacking. They had 3 main results and I had the following issues. Result 1- not new, known in the field for 10+ years. Result 2- not significant, a 5% effect when the spread between different samples was ~50%, they had ran just 4 samples so with more data maybe the effect would be significant but its difficult to tell. Result 3- potentially interesting result but they had based the result on images where one of the colour channels had clearly saturated so the data was possibly invalid, I asked them to retake the images and do a bit more quantitative analysis of them.

Anyway I got an email from my friend the editor who thanked me and said he was rejecting the paper based on my and one other reviewer who had similar issue to me. The third reviewer found no issue with the paper apparently. However, about a week later I got an email from MDPI saying the paper had been published! Apparently someone at MDPI went above my friends head and just accepted the publication. So now there is a ""peer reviewed"" paper out there with my name as one of the reviewers and my friend as an editor that is clearly terrible. Both of us said reject but as its printed our names give it credibility."
332,AskAcademia,What is the perception of Universities and Guides about prospecting PhD candidate who have already quit a PhD?,"> So what are my chances at a good PhD (especially in Europe) if I heve previously quit a PhD?

You haven't even been in for two months, just leave it off your resume/application. Get out now while you can do it with minimal damage."
333,AskAcademia,What is it like being in a PhD program while being in a relationship with someone who is not in school at all or doesn’t know much about academia?,"My fiancee is not in academia and I am *extremely* grateful for that fact.

For context: I met my s/o in the middle of my PhD and we dated for the last \~2 years of my PhD. When I got a postdoc in another city, she moved with me, and we're still going strong two years later.

Having a non-academic s/o has helped me maintain a much healthier work-life balance than I see of many of my colleagues that are (single or) in relationships with other academics. She works the same hours every day, which more-or-less forces me to work the same hours every day, too. We wake up, leave for work, come home and go to bed at the same times. In the evenings we have dinner together and relax, or go out and see friends, or whatever. (I mean normally, not during the coronavirus pandemic, of course.)

I'm much more productive in the daytime, and much more relaxed in the evenings, and I sleep much better, than before we started dating. It's a lot harder to be suckered into staying up all night working on research, responding to emails, etc., when you're spending time with your non-academic s/o who wants to do normal-person-things with you.

Another benefit is that what binds us is non-work related, which is great therapy. When I'm stressed about research/teaching/all the other academic b/s, I can put it all to rest and just enjoy my time with her.

I do want to pick up on something you said:

>I still worry that grad school will consume me & I will not have any time for him & our relationship

If you don't have time for your relationship, either (1) you should not be in your relationship, or (2) you should not be in academia.

Despite what people like to say, it *is* possible to be successful in academia and maintain a healthy relationship. You just have to avoid being consumed by it, and accept that you might not achieve perfection but you can still do very well."
334,AskAcademia,"PhD students, academia and Covid-19. How this will affect our future?","I expect a lot of leniency in the years to come. Extensions on clocks for tenure, scholarships,  everything."
335,AskAcademia,Can children come to academic conferences with a parent attendee/presenter?,"I was a single Mom for most of my academic career so I recognize how hard it can be. With that said, when my son was younger, I still wouldn't have brought him no matter how hard it was to get childcare. It's not like I could get up and leave during my presentation if he wasn't behaving himself. A restless kid during a boring presentation (no matter how well behaved someone insists their kid is) isn't exactly a recipe for success and without me there sitting beside him because I'm presenting, I can't really do much to stop it  in the moment if he starts acting up. Sure, I can deal with it later, but he already would have ruined important work in other people's career. Nope. That's a hard no for me. 

Worst case, I might have asked someone I know to hang out with him somewhere during my presentation like in the lobby or a coffeeshop nearby. Hand them a few bucks... go take him to the ice cream shop at the end of the block or something. 

Now, that he's a teenager, it's still not my first choice, but in a crisis, I probably would be fine with bringing him as long my conference rules allowed for guests. But if the content wasn't appropriate, that's on me. I've presented on aspects of trafficking and porn in some of my research and I'm not alone in hitting on some hard hitting and taboo topics in my field. I wouldn't expect anyone to tone down their presentation to suit my choice to involve a kid. But that aside, I wouldn't have a huge issue with it now."
336,AskAcademia,"When professors say things like, “Let’s keep in touch,” what do they mean? What should I do?",I have several former students that email me from time to time just to check in or ask for advice. I always like hearing from them. I'm also much more likely to write a great letter for a student that keeps me up to date on their professional work/goals.
337,AskAcademia,"Removing an underperforming undergraduate researcher, as a PhD Student?","Homework. 

Don't drop him yet, but give him homework. 

Unfortunately sometimes we have to learn from our mistakes however he has an audience, you. Have him give a full and detailed explanation of his simple mistakes and how he should have gone about business, similar to drawing (honest) conclusions for a poorly planned and carried out experiment. 

If he fails to do this then he isn't learning from his mistakes and you shouldn't have to let him progress to the next part of the study.

Hopefully this will encourage him to do a little research before touching things. He might even end up teaching you something, for example in this data analysis task he should already have done homework and using you as validation of his research (self taught) rather than being spoon fed by you."
338,AskAcademia,"Is a Harvard CV the standard for academia? How do ""fancy"" CV's fare?","A well structured, easy to read CV is more valuable than a fancy CV. Making well use of the space on the page and really outlining your accomplishments in a way that the reader can easily see what you’ve done."
339,AskAcademia,Is there anything that can be done to address the humanities jobs crisis?,"There is one easy thing that schools can do and that is stop offering a slate of PhDs in specific fields where there is a crisis of jobs. Most R2s and even quite a few R1s should pare back on the number of PhDs they admit. 

However, the death of any field is always greatly exaggerated. The research will continue and will be done by the schools who are already doing good work. It is the long tail that is often the problem.

But, in most schools, humanities PhDs do the bulk of TA-ing or instructing freshman courses so these schools have little incentive to do that?"
340,AskAcademia,How do I publish now that I've left academia?,"Same as before.

You do not need any affiliation for publishing. So, you can be an ""Independent Researcher"" with your own email address, and still publish. This is what I am (partially) doing. Perhaps I would recommend to have your own webpage (where you put your interests, papers, etc.) and your own address, and not a Yahoo or hotmail address :)

Regarding fees, this will be journal dependent, and you will need to ask. I personally publish in journals where there is no publication fee (but the papers are not open access). However, I always put a preprint online which I regularly update so that people can still access my papers for free. This is allowed by the journals I publish in.

Finally, regarding paper output, you can still collaborate with other people. I have several collaborations running at the moment, and this helps with keeping the output at a reasonable level.

Edit. I am in STEM."
341,AskAcademia,Is a healthy work/life balance possible for an academic?,"I think it's possible, but you need to be really sure of your ability to set boundaries, and also choose advisors who will respect those boundaries. I worked a 9-5 for two years and maintained am excellent work/life balance. I thought going into my PhD I'd be able to keep those boundaries for myself, but it's much easier said than done. My advisor is a workaholic, and while she doesn't state it explicitly, she expects her students to be the same way. Given that so many people in academia genuinely LOVE Being workaholics, it can get very isolating, and take a huge toll on your self esteem, to feel like you're always doing less than your peers. 

Anyway, I'd say it's definitely possible, but you need to make sure you choose your academic support system carefully, clearly state your boundaries from the get go, and don't let yourself fall down the rabbit hole of saying yes to more work than you can realistically take on during a 40-hour work week (no matter how desperate your advisor is for data)

342,AskAcademia,what are the rules for emailing a professor at a university I do not attend?,"Professors get tons of emails. Don't ""low-key mention [you] want to study at their University"". Reach out, tell them you appreciate their work and why and tell them you are interested in working with them (assuming you're doing a thesis-based master's)."
343,AskAcademia,Is anyone willing to be a guest-speaker in my bioethics and medical literature class for 1 hour this spring?,I can recommend you reach out to John Loike of Columbia. He teaches a bioethics course and just generally loves to talk. You’ll have to do some searching for his email and just send him a cold email
344,AskAcademia,Every research job I see in academia requires a PhD. I'd like to work in research but think only a Masters is viable for me. Is it possible to work in (academic) research with only a Masters?,"It depends on the field I imagine. In the life (especially biomedical) sciences, there's plenty of support roles in research labs (research coordinator, lab tech, etc). There's also more research focused roles typically called something like *staff scientist* that you could do with a masters. These are roles where you aren't a PI but work with a PI in their lab. For example, at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://hr.wustl.edu/careers/featured-positions/research-careers/).

I don't know about the other STEM fields, and I definitely don't know about fields outside of STEM."
345,AskAcademia,Anyone doing a PhD without the goal of working in academia?,"I’m a second year. I don’t publicize that I’m not going into academia. I do think it’s a waste of income making years. I enjoy research. But I knew when I started, a career in academia wasn’t for me. However, my colleagues all plan to go into academia and these connections will allow me to collaborate on research projects after the PhD. I hope to do clinical work as my career and some research as a hobby. I’m not getting richer by doing this, only gaining knowledge. But to me it’s worth it. "
346,AskAcademia,What's it like being a researcher in a developing country?,"I used to be a researcher in the Philippines.

I'm already one of the lucky ones as I'm in the top university and part of a project with one of the highest fundings.

This funding was still small compared to what is available in developed countries Our lab barely had any budget and equipment.

It was so hard to spend what available budget we had because of all the red tape. It would take more than a month to get a purchase approved. Sometimes orders for chemicals/equipment would take up to 6 months. I have witnessed another project take up the whole 2 year duration just procuring equipment and never get to actually get them delivered. A research project is usually 70% trying so hard to get to spend the budget and 30% actually doing research.

I don't think funding is a problem but getting to actually spend that funding in a timely manner (if spent at all) is the problem. Another is it's quite difficult to collaborate with other labs because of how touchy they are with their equipment (understandable). There was this lab where I was requesting to use one of their equipment and they would've let me but it was missing a replacement part the size of a screw and they said I had to wait 3 months because their order had just been processed.

As a government-funded institution in a country with a culture of corruption. The commission on audit tries to make it hard for every bit of purchase to be approved. It is by law that every purchase above ~$20 has to have three quotations before it is approved. Imagine having to request 3 quotations from suppliers for just about every item to be purchased.


This is compounded by the fact that our bureau of customs for importing goods and products is one big pool of corrupt government workers on ALL levels. I mean from bottom to top.

This is why there is a trend to just go with computational research to at least have an output.

Before we even get our hands on what we ordered, it is already time to write the final report on the project.

It's so unfortunate because I have met some of the most passionate and skilled researchers in my life at our institution even compared to those I encounter now that I am a researcher in a developed country."
347,AskAcademia,Inappropriate to ask professor for another research opportunity?,"no harm in asking! tell him what you said here, that you enjoyed the research and the opportunity and that you'd like to continue working with him. and of course, pitch any new ideas you may have. glad you had such a nice experience with him!"
348,AskAcademia,Anybody feel like it’s never enough?,"It do be like that. Academia and research in general is pretty much structured such that the sky is the limit. You could always be doing more, reading more, writing more. 

I try to use a combo of triage and goal setting to turn off the ""never enough"" feeling. I set pretty realistic goals for what I wanna achieve each year, each semester, each week. I actually plug these into my calendar. So these goals become milestones and deadlines that once met, helps my brain go ""ok goal achieved = effort is enough"".

As for triage.... It's a matter of deciding what's more important to me. Life goals and relationship goals are important goals too. Could I spend my Friday night working on a paper? Yes of course. Would it help my career? Yes of course. But could I instead spend my Friday night having a date night with my wonderful partner? You betcha. Is it going to help strengthen my relationship and further my life goals? Absolutely. 

So weighing each against the other, I'd rather spend time with my partner. The paper will wait, but health (emotional or physical) won't. I think also conceptualizing my ""free time"" and personal relationships as goals to achieve helps with feeling like I'm still *doing* something and meeting my goals."

Your defence is the best conversation you will ever get to have about your dissertation.

All those arguments you've had at conferences ... parties where you've been boring people to tears by talking about your research ... your advisor paying just enough attention to make relevant responses ... your pharmacist staring at you blankly as you rant about citation stylesheets -- those conversations were just try-outs for *the one really good conversation*.

You get to have a chat with people who have really made an effort to get to grips with what you have been wrestling with for years. They'll actually have *paid attention to what you're saying*. And that can be awesome. Even if you become famous and get interviewed on the Late Show, the people there aren't going to be as interested in your work as the people at your defence will be.

OK, sure, they'll have criticisms. But they'll also be more invested in your work than anyone else in the world that isn't you. Make the most of it!

Help from librarians. Relying on the savvy of older colleagues in the field to suggest seminal work. Making friends with obsessive coworkers with huge filing cabinets who would save every paper they read.

354,AskAcademia,How is it that the standard time for a PhD in Germany is 3 years whereas in the US it can be as long as 10 years? Are they treated equally?,"German PhDs require you get a 2 year masters first so they’re still roughly equivalent. Very rarely do PhDs last 10 years in the US except in some fields like education. Typically, US PhDs are 5-7 years. Americans consider the American PhD to carry more weight. Not sure of the converse.

You're doing great, and a Master's is a fantastic upper-level degree. You should be so proud of what you've accomplished"
357,AskPhilosophy,Why isn’t the field of philosophy concerned with communicating its ideas to the general public?,"Obviously there's a ton of public philosophy, but as for why there isn't more, and why there isn't as much as public science, I think it's a mixture of a lot of things. A few potential reasons:

1. People don't trust philosophers as much as they trust scientists and so one faces a much higher hill to climb, if it's even possible, if one's goal is to convince people.

2. Philosophers despise dogmatism and failing to think for oneself. They are less concerned with conclusions alone and more concerned with the reasons supporting those conclusions. But one cannot really communicate the reasons to the public any more than a scientist can communicate their experiment methodology to the public. It's too complicated. And so unlike science, where what's valuable is the result you reach rather than the process by which you got there, philosophy has less that's worth communicating to the public.

3. Philosophical views tend to be things people either don't care about at all or care about so much that they are not likely to be happy to have those views challenged. Science sits in a comfy middle ground: it has implications which people care about a lot, but few people have strongly held views about the nature of scientific topics that they're inclined to cling to even in the face of scientists saying otherwise.

4. Philosophers tend to have a harder time arriving at consensus than scientists and so it's not like there are obvious ""right answers"" that we can bring to the public like newly-discovered scientific stuff.

5. A lot of philosophy gets done in stuff the public is already consuming, like novels, TV shows, and movies. (The recent TV miniseries *devs* was all about free will, for instance.) It's not professional philosophy but it is philosophy, and so people who are interested in philosophical topics often have their fill of engagement just with what they're already consuming. Meanwhile it's hard to get science just from watching a TV show or reading a book or whatever. (There are exceptions, but they are relatively few.)

6. A lot of science is done by professional (or quasi-professional) scientific communicators rather than scientists themselves, which is possible only because there's a ton of money floating around science departments. There's no money to pay people to be professional philosophy communicators.

7. Scientists suck up huge amounts of taxpayer money and perhaps feel some duty to justify this. Philosophers barely cost anything so we might think that philosophers don't feel like they have to show people they are getting their money's worth.

8. It's rare for scientific results to be anti-establishment, controversial, dangerous to talk about, etc. In some areas of philosophy one's views can be quite controversial such that if you publicize them a lot you're asking for a lot of trouble. Peter Singer gets tons of death threats, or at least he used to. I doubt many scientists get death threats.

I could keep going but that should give you a start."
358,AskPhilosophy,"Einstein once said ""I believe with Schopenhauer that one of the strongest motives that leads men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one's own ever shifting desires."" Where can I find Schopenhauer's discussion of this?",Book Three of *The World as Will and Representation*
359,AskPhilosophy,"How can I ever be confident in my beliefs if there is an infinite amount of thinking, research, and discussion that I have not experienced that would potentially change my opinion?","I think you can answer this for yourself by examining beliefs about which you are particularly confident (with clear and proper justification; easier said than recognized, but still).

Are you confident that, given it is raining outside, you will get wet if you step out the door?

Are you confident that, given that it appears to have done so every day throughout your entire life and presumably the entire existence of humanity beforehand, the sun will once again rise tomorrow?

Are you confident that 2+2=4?

These examples employ different kinds of reasoning - inductive in the first two cases, deductive in the third - but all are examples of “good” reasoning (read: strong/valid) *assuming the information given.* Which is really the problem you’re pointing to - isn’t it always possible that there could be *more* information potentially available than what is given in a particular instance of belief which might in theory change the strength or validity of said belief?

Well, yes - and no. For conclusions reached by way of inductively strong reasoning (such as in the first two examples), this is always technically true; even causality itself is arguably subject to this variety of criticism (see [Hume](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/) for a more interesting discussion of that can of worms). That said, it’s sort of just “part of the game” in that it’s not really conceivable how it could be otherwise; if a belief is reached by way of reliance upon prior evidence, it will always be subject to revision upon the accumulation of *more* or *better* evidence in the future - and that’s actually a pretty *good* thing, if you think about it. It means we’ll never be “stuck” - at least not to the extent that we actually do value the acquisition of genuinely true beliefs, which is something that can be quite plausibly called into question (again, a separate - and somewhat more depressing - issue; see Peirce’s “[The Fixation of Belief](http://www.peirce.org/writings/p107.html)” for more on that note).

However, for conclusions reached by way of *deductively valid* reasoning, no amount of evidence or new information will *ever* change the truth of the conclusion; the only things which can affect the epistemic status of the belief are (i) a change in the *nature of the rules of the system themselves*, e.g. suppose that instead of the traditional addition operation over the reals we are actually talking about the 2-adic metric: now, 2+2=...well, something different - frankly, I forget what; but it’s not 4, because *the rules for how to add numbers* and even *what those numbers represent* are now *themselves different*; or (ii) a denial of the truth and/or relevance of one of the assumed premises to the actual situations in which the belief is being applied; e.g. suppose you tell me, “I know that there are 4 apples in that bag because I saw you put 2 inside just after someone else had put 2 inside, so there must be 4” and I said, “That may be true, but you’re assuming that there were 0 apples in the bag to begin with; in fact, the bag already contained at least one apple - so there’s now at least 5 inside” (I realize that’s a somewhat trite example, but it’s harder to come up with these than you might think lol).

In all, I hope this at least gave you something to think about, and I encourage you to read a bit more about this - it’s a fascinating subject which I could go on for hours about, but for now I’ll spare you such punishment and leave it at this."
360,AskPhilosophy,Can democracy be justified if the voting population is too stupid or irresponsible to handle existential issues that affect people outside of it like with climate change or nuclear weapons?,"There is a very interesting book by Jason Brennan called ""Against Democracy"" which I think largely addresses your question. 

In a nutshell, he argues that the majority of people are enormously unqualified to vote and do not possess even the rudimentary prerequisite knowledge to make an informed decision. Furthermore, democracy makes us civic enemies and does not seem to increase political knowledge overall according a broad survey of empirical research on this topic. Then, he argues that democracy has no intrinsic value and insofar as this is true, it is worth at least trying a different form of government which might achieve a better society (I.e. consequentialist rather than deontological reasoning). He proposes an epistocracy - or rule of the experts. Presumably, some kind of test is instituted and those who pass are able to vote and those who don't are not. 

Personally, I don't think this is that ridiculous of an idea. Sure, perhaps the people who pass the test may be disproportionately one group in society because it favors those with more education, but so do things like medical licenses. There is also empirical evidence that the vast majority of people actually do vote for what they perceive to be the better good of the country rather than themselves because an individual vote is near meaningless.

If you are interested in non-democratic theory, I highly recommend the book. It's quite thought-provoking, if nothing else."

362,AskPhilosophy,Is it morally obligatory to watch hentai over other types of porn?,"I'm not aware of any literature specifically comparing the morality of hentai and ""real"" porn, but generally the anti-porn argument (as mostly famously stated by MacKinnon and Dworkin) concerns *all* porn, though many their arguments (and rhetorics) tend to be from the perspective of ""real"" porn. Eaton (in her paper *Towards a sensible anti-porn feminism*) or Caroline West identify **three** locuses of harm in porn: either directly in production (the abuses of the porn industry, which only applies to ""real porn"", and likely only a subset of that which is 'professionally made'), the harm done to consumers (West in particular takes this along the libertarian line of harm to a future self in skewing perceptions), and harm to others after consumption (e.g. violence or assault against women, proclivity to rape, etc.) - the last of which is probably the most controversial and all-encompassing (as it would include hentai too, though whether the empirical data applies equally well to hentai is questionable).

Eaton compares the causative nature of the harm to smoking. When we say that ""smoking causes lung cancer"", that kind of causation is the sort which, if supported by empirical data, is a version of the feminist argument against porn. That applies to both ""real"" porn and hentai. Similarly, in [Debating Pornography](https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/debating-pornography/), Altman compares porn consumption to alcohol:

> Altman goes on to compare pornography use and alcohol use. He argues  that in the case of the latter, there is clear evidence at the social  level that it causes sexual and non-sexual violence against women. On  average, women are physically weaker than men, which often makes them  the easy victims of drunken men. In this way, they suffer  disproportionally from the harms caused by alcohol. However, adults  still have a right to buy and consume alcohol. The right to sexual  autonomy (and hence to consume pornography) is a more significant right  than the right to use alcohol. Altman concludes from the above that  there is a moral right to pornography, and that the choice to consume  pornography properly belongs to the individual. 

Nevertheless, Susan Brison has forcefully argued against a 'moral right' to pornography.

Another option I haven't seen considered anywhere is that hentai may qualify as being more artistic in some way than 'real' porn. This means that more hentai than 'real porn' could be considered erotica. Defining erotica and porn (in contrast to one another), as well as if either, neither, or both qualify as art (and what that means for their right to enjoyment, production, or moral status) remains a tricky issue, but some (see [this SEP article](https://stanford.library.sydney.edu.au/entries/erotic-art/) near the bottom) argue that the distinction, even if there is one, is irrelevant, and erotica should be just as condemned as pornography in the anti-porn feminist project.

From what I can gather, this leads to a conclusion that in some way it *is* better (constituting only two harms at maximum rather than three), but whether that difference qualifies as a moral obligation, I don't know. Personal opinion: to some, it may be similar to the question of whether one is morally obligated to 'painlessly' kill an animal rather than to kill an animal otherwise. Most people against animal killing in general have little time for questions like that, and others would probably say it depends what harms you want to avoid, or at least, which you weigh up to be important enough (on the basis of empirical data or otherwise).

363,AskPhilosophy,"How to deal with unproductive gadflies like followers of Stephen Molyneux, Ben Shapiro, and Jordan Peterson?","Card carrying Sophist here (a rhetorican who teaches philosophy).  There is no sure fire way to deal with these folks, but there are a few things worth suggesting.

As a preface, no one enjoys yelling about how Peterson is wrong more than I do, but it's a futile exercise in certain cases.  Peterson succeeds in a lot of his various rhetorical enterprises because he tends to attack (1) bogeymen and (2) people who aren't good at defending themselves.  In particular, his favorite targets are the theoretical chimera-ghost named ""post modernism"" and impassioned but often inarticulate leftist college students.  This drives me nuts since, in theory, he's supposed to be a professor and picking on students is generally poor form.  So, understand that when you engage with these people they are armed with bad arguments, and they're armed with bad arguments designed to (1) make people like you feel stupid and (2) make the people wielding them feel empowered.

So, what to do?  I think in cases like this the savvy arguer should accept that some arguments are not only not worth having, but better off not being had at all.  These people crave your aggression - their whole platform grows off the ""intolerant,"" feels-before-reals left.

So, take this tip from one of the ""post-modernist"" lefties - Richard Rorty: my advisor had dinner with Rorty once at some academic function and saw someone lay into him.  Rorty took it all in and responded only with this - ""I don't quite see why we should talk that way?""  Rorty seems to imply that he was entertaining the position as one for ""us"", but he had no interest to refute it.  The other person was deflated entirely.

The rhetorical lesson here from the arch-bro-pragmatist is the power of ambivalence.  Being antagonistic - even agonistic - will get you nowhere in these situations.  Neither will being totally dismissive.  But the middle ground is very hard to contend with if you're an argumentative person.  They see arguments as battles to be won or lost, and it's hard to beat a person who doesn't recognize there's a fight happening.

When you find yourself in one of these situations, if you want to engage at all (and, remember, you don't have to) do only two things: (1) listen very carefully and (2) ask a lot of questions.  Importantly, don't be a devil's advocate and don't try to do fancy Socratic tricks where you lead them into a contradiction.  Just listen as hard as you can and be sincerely interested and utterly confused.  Ask as often as you can ""Interesting - why should we think that's true?"" Or ""Wow, what kind of evidence do we have for that?"" or ""Wait, can you redo that part?  How do we get from [x] to [y]?"" Or ""What follows from this?"" Or ""But doesn't that commit us to [x]?"" Etc.

I can't say this enough - don't try to win.  Don't look for ""gotcha"" moments. If they seem to contradict themselves, point it out in the softest terms possible, ""So how do we reconcile that with what you said before?"" Or ""Oh, I think I got lost somewhere as I understood you to have formerly said [x].""  If they sense you're trying to play them, they'll ramp up or accuse you of ""bad faith"" or whatever.  So, the best bet is to honestly not try to play them.

Be honestly and sincerely confused.  It won't be hard!  It's totally exhausting to talk to a person who does this and even people who love to hear themselves talk can't do it for very long.  Honestly one of the few ways to really move people like this is to get them to externalize some implication that they hadn't realized they were committed to.  But if you force it, they'll feel persuaded and will recoil.

This method the basic model of what any philosophy professor would do when confronted with a ranty and ultimately unsound student.  You can't argue with them - they already ""know"" you're wrong.  So, get around that problem by not having any position to be wrong about.

Some arguers will try to pin you down and get you committed to some position, and sometimes there is no way out.  If pressed, you can always say what you think and preclude the follow up by saying, ""but honestly I'm not quite sure what led me to that view."" Or ""Honesly I'm not sure what to think about that.""

If they're the type that will only play through a bad Socrates impression, then look for ways to respond to their questions with questions.  Usually a Socratic question is an argument in disguise and you can ask why a particular dilemma emerges (if suggested) or why an implication follows (if implied).  But, again, if you lean into this too hard you'll get found out.  You have to be sincere and sometimes you just have to disengage.  

You don't owe these people an argument."
364,AskPhilosophy,"I'm a 30 year old idiot- what are some essential, but approachable/understandable, readings I can absorb and use as a basis to move forward?",">I am an idiot- I have already established that for you-, and on top of that, I have an extremely difficult time absorbing + retaining information.

Hey there. So first of all I wanted to address this a little bit. So many people think they should be able to just dive in to complex books, whether they be philosophical or literary, without having done any prior training before hand, and subsequently can't concentrate or understand what's going on. This often leads people to getting put off and thinking, as you do, that they're not smart enough to understand these things. This is complete nonsense.

The analogy I always think of is going to the gym. Diving in to any the primary texts of most of the philosophers you mentioned would be like trying to bench or squat some huge weight on your first day in the gym because some of the guys who have been training for years can do it. But realistically, you won't be able to even lift the weights off the floor and will become easily discouraged thinking you're weak. However, if you spend time building up to get to that point eventually you'll train your muscles to be strong enough to achieve your goal. The same applies to the brain.

Reading is a skill that you have to maintain to keep good at, and if you stop reading for a significant period of time (much like stopping lifting weights or running or whatever) you will get worse at it. But that doesn't mean you're stupid or weak, it just means you're out of practice. Remember that. I know for sure that I've gone through period where I find it extremely difficult to concentrate on philosophy, despite having studied philosophy for over 10 years.

Now also remember that using the internet the way we do regularly primes your brain for quick rewards. Your brain essentially gets programmed to seek out things that don't require sustained attention because the dopamine centres in our brain get adapted to skim reading and short quick videos. There are loads of studies on this phenomenon. *The Shallows: How the internet is changing our brain* by Nicolas Carr is a great book on this. 

Basically, if you want to get better at understanding philosophy you have to first learn how to read properly and how to absorb information with sustained attention. Sometimes using the internet less, or meditating before reading, or something similar to clear your mind really helps with that.

>So what are the ""basic"" fundamental philosophical works I must absorb before moving onto the works of some of the aforementioned philosophers? How do you decide which direction to head in once you've gotten the essentials down?

OK to answer your actual question. Most of Western philosophy is based on a tradition that started with Plato. So finding out as much as you can about Plato, especially his *Republic* is always a great starting point. There's tons of videos and info online that can help you with that. Plato is also really fun to read compared to some of denser later philosophy.

Other than Plato, one of the fathers of modern philosophy is Descartes. His *Meditations* is almost universally taught in first year philosophy classes and it's essentially an exercise in scepticism which teaches you to think philosophically. Imo knowing about Descartes and Plato is pretty necessary for most later philosophy.

However, it seems from your list that you're quite interested in existentialism (Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Sartre etc.). Jumping into Nietzsche can be really exciting because his writing is brilliant and you might get a lot from it despite not knowing a huge amount about philosophy. Some of his books are written partly as aphorisms which you can just read individually and ponder over. Where to start with Nietzsche is up for debate but a lot people recommend *Beyond Good and Evil* if you're looking for an overview of Nietzsche's thought. But bare in mind you won't understand a lot of it, but just enjoy the process.

>Also, what to do with all this knowledge once you've amassed it, other than take part in impressive debates? Is there any concrete way to implement all this knowledge into life? It all seems so abstract, that I wonder if it's anything more than a great big waste of time? I don't mean to be offensive in suggesting that, but I'm just wondering out loud. How do you use this knowledge? Can it be profound and life-changing?

Absolutely. Learning how to think critically can be immensely useful in day to day life. But that is more of a personal journey you'll have to go through. There are also lot's of practical applications in the fields of ethics and philosophy of science to name a couple. Understanding how certain systems operate from a philosophical perspective is really useful in lots of fields.

Anyway hope that helps a little bit. Good luck getting started! Feel free to drop a reply if you have any questions."
365,AskPhilosophy,"What did Kierkegaard mean with ""I think the world will come to an end amid the general applause from all the wits who believe that it is a joke""?","This quote is a powerful illustration of some of Kierkegaard's key concepts, but a bit of background knowledge is necessary to see why. (I'll sketch some of this background here, but I also recommend reading *The Present Age*--a short text, and a lovely introduction to Kierkegaard in general.) An early critic of modernity, Kierkegaard claims that the present age is characterized by an excess of reflective self-consciousness to the detriment of action and passionate inwardness. The present age has made itself into an object of its own reflective knowledge, and for Kierkegaard, this reflective self-knowledge distances the individual from himself as a passionate actor in his own life and prevents him from making an inward commitment that secures life as something of genuine significance. Instead, the age “reduces the inward reality of all relationships by means of a reflective tension which leaves everything standing but makes the whole of life ambiguous: so that everything continues to exist in fact whilst by a dialectical deceit, privatissime, it supplies a secret interpretation of the facts—that it does not exist.""

--

The sphere of life is transformed into a complex of formal relations wherein, for example, a royal subject does not relate as an individual to his king but, as an individual, is rendered external to the purely formal relation between a hypothetical subject and a hypothetical king, in which the individual participates only by rote, reflectively accepting the relation as what one does, but without any inward commitment. Without this inwardness, the individual's subjective commitment to the meaningfulness of life, the whole sphere of life becomes an arena of knowledge without content, a system of significances that, deprived of anyone to be significant *to*, is brought to the brink of collapse.

--

One of the consequences of this transformation of the age is that everything in the public sphere is trivialized: without inwardness, there are no events, only the oscillating and decisionless reflection of a society perpetually emptying itself of value. Reflection may create the illusion that something is happening, that people are making up their minds, that people have values and projects and ideals, but only as a kind of joke that, secretly, everybody is in on. Kierkegaard imagines a group of ostensibly politically radical individuals gathering together to plan a revolution, giving fiery speeches to one another, and then leaving for the night, having given one another the sense that a revolution has actually happened--all without ever having done anything, or, indeed, having really intended to do anything.

--

For Kierkegaard, the present age places a historically distinctive pressure on the individual to make the passionate inward commitment to the religious life. For one with passion, everything is outwardly exactly the same as for one without; the religious individual is unrecognizable by any external mark (all the aforementioned formal relations remain in place, after all), and others will either fail to notice him or fail to take him seriously. But from within, the world is transformed.

--

A similar idea is at work in your quotation. The people in the audience, thinking themselves very clever and privy to the illusory nature of the happenings on stage, cannot take life seriously enough to believe the clown might *not* be telling a joke. To them, everything has been emptied of significance, and nothing exists anymore; the possibility that the clown may be warning them with passionate sincerity cannot be countenanced, since passion is something utterly inward, something that plenty of reflective people may think they understand well enough as a conceptual matter and may even *play* at having, all while secretly doubting there could be any such thing. Thus they cannot but interpret the clown as laughing along with them, and the world burns to the applause and amusement of the audience."
366,AskPhilosophy,Why can't philosophical arguments be explained 'easily'?,"The results of some fields, like, for example, medicine, astronomy, behavioral psychology, or engineering, can be appreciated without really having much background in those fields. That is, one need not know anything about pharmacology to appreciate the efficacy of certain drugs. Or again, one need not actually conduct an experiment to appreciate the experimental results of behavioral economists like Daniel Kahneman. In general, I think a lot of sciences and social sciences have this feature: one can appreciate the results of these fields without having to actually participate in these fields.

But not all fields are like this. The humanities seem particularly different. Take the field of philosophy. Philosophy is about arguments. Merely presenting a conclusion doesn't really work. And that's a lot different from what Neil Degrasse Tyson gets to do. He gets to walk into a room and say, ""we are right now on the cusp of figuring out how black holes really work. What we found is X, Y, Z."" Of course, no one in the audience has ever read a science journal, or has any idea of the evidence behind his claim. He just makes the claim and everyone gets to say ""Wow! That's really cool that black holes work like that."" And this holds true for the social sciences too.

For philosophy, however, you have to see the whole argument to appreciate the conclusion. It's just not satisfying to be told ""actually, 'knowledge' doesn't quite seem to be justified, true belief."" Or, ""actually, your naive ideas of moral relativism are not justified."" Or ""the concept of free-will you are working with is terribly outdated"" (and those are just some of the more accessible sorts of issues!) If you are asking philosophical questions, you probably want answers that explain *why* those are the answers. And the ""why"" here has to be the whole argument -- simplifications just won't do. In a lot of philosophy we are looking at conceptual connections, and to simplify even a little is often to lose the relevant concepts and the whole argument. But if you're asking questions of the natural and social sciences, the ""why"" component is much less important; you are much more interested in what is the case, and you are generally content with either no why-explanation, or one that relies upon metaphor and simplification. That's why Tyson can talk about colliding bowling balls and stretched balloons and people can feel like they are learning something. But if a philosopher were to try that, people would scoff and rightfully so. Tyson can implicitly appeal to empirical evidence conducted in a faraway lab to support what he's saying. But philosophers make no such appeal, and so the evidence they appeal to can only be the argument itself.

You don't have to actually *do* any science to appreciate a lot of its findings. For philosophy, though, you have to get somewhat in the muck to start to appreciate what's going on."

368,AskPhilosophy,"A top honors student in my university believes in Jordan Peterson's idea of ""truth"" - I tried convincing him it was nonsense but failed. What sources can I read up on to better understand how to argue this point?","I'm going to divide up my comment into two sections in order to address two different problems: (a) how your interlocutor is probably going wrong and (b) what you want to do about it.

> I'm sure there are other lines of argumentation and I'm sure mine can be refined, but where do I start with doing that? Or am I wrong, and is this actually a usable definition of truth?

So, (a) Peterson's theory of truth is really hard to get a grip on partially because he has never bothered to really write it down - it exists in scattered YouTubes, YouTubes in which Peterson admits that his positions are often inchoate.  Keep in mind that this is a guy who thinks his interlocutors do him wrong when they try to ""pin him down.""  The closest he comes to writing down his views is the preface of *Maps of Meaning* wherein he seems to describe a two-level view of truth - wherein there are these sorts of empirical truths which can be well sorted out in the lab versus these other ""metaphorical"" kinds of truths (of the sort that myths would fit into).  This latter group of things are truth-evaluated differently since their purpose and how the fit the world are either a radical difference in degree or a sheer difference in kind in comparison to stuff like what color the chair is.  In Peterson's more recent comments on the matter (like the ridiculous episode of *Waking Up* where two dudes re-invent epistemology based on their not any training in it), it sounds like he either has rejected this prior view or holds that the difference can only be a difference in degree (given the confounding atom bomb example).

As /u/lifexmoves suggests, things get really strange here because it seems like Peterson must hold one of three views: (1) proposition p is true just in case it maximizes a believer in p's survival, (2) proposition p is true just in case it tends to maximize the survival of all possible believers, or (3) some combination of (1) and (2).  If (1), then we really do have a situation where p is true and p is false depending on the believer, if (2) then this problem goes away, if (3) who knows (we need a more complex decision procedure for truth evaluation).

Presumably (2) is the easy road to take, though it presents a practical difficulty, namely that individual believers are going to be really terrible at truth evaluation.  The average believer has no idea what the long-term consequences of a belief are.  Even in the case of the atom bomb the issue is quite confusing.  Currently the world has not yet been destroyed by an atom bomb, but it might be.  Alternatively, fear of mutually assured destruction may win out and thinking the atom bomb works will ultimately ensure the atom bomb never destroys humanity.  So, should I believe the atom bomb functions?  Something is really weird about this question, since believing the atom bomb doesn't function requires that I radically revise my understanding of World War II which, of course, contains a functioning atom bomb or two.  In short, (2) is either unworkable for an individual truth-evaluator or requires way more explanation.  Importantly, we could just say, ""Oh - who said a theory of truth needed to be accurately usable by an individual truth-evaluator?""  In fact, Peirce's own theory of truth works this way since constantly refers to something which individual practioners don't have access to - scientific conclusions in the very long term.  Yet, Peirce doesn't say we should believe things because they track some specific long-term belief - that would be impossible!  This gives us a hint into one possible confusion in Peterson's theory since Peterson does seem to think the theory of truth is supposed to educate belief somehow.

/u/lifexmoves presents (1) as entailing a serious problem, but the problem only emerges if the theory of truth in question isn't deeply relativistic.  If the theory of truth at hand is relativistic, then it's perfectly natural and even expected that it might seem like p is true and false, because it's truth and falsity relies on certain facts about individual believers.  Yet, Peterson seems to pretend to being an enemy of relativism since the idea that 'all interpretations are true' is ridiculous.  Is it ridiculous because some are more conducive to live, relative to a believer or is it ridiculous because some things about the world are true for non-relativistic reasons?

One plausible way to unwind this knot is to suggest that Peterson has confused two kinds of theories - theories of truth and theories of belief.  In the case of Peirce, Peirce has a theory of truth which is given in reference to something which seems inaccessible to the believer (very long run conclusions), but this frustration goes away when we notice Peirce's theory of belief is the thing that gives us the theory of truth in the first place.  Peirce posits that the goal of inquiry is fixing belief; belief is best fixed via experimentation; if truth is the result of inquiry done right, then truth is the result of a community of experimenters working for a very long time.  By attending to belief formation and truth, Peirce's theory shows how we could resolve the kinds of apparent contradictions which /u/lifexmoves tries to highlight - p is either true or false, sure, but two different believers might be in a different position with respect to reasons for thinking that p is true or false.  So one agent believes, one does not, but clearly one (or more) have gone awry in some way.  No big deal.  James' theory of truth (which is much more radical) resolves the problem in a similar way.  With respect to the existence of God, two believers are in different positions with respect to reasons to believe.  The only difference with James is that his theory of truth confounds asking whether or not its true that God exists, and here James is going to give a pretty complicated and possibly confusing answer.

Anyway, the TL;DR here is that Peterson's theory of truth is a mess, and probably conflates truth-evaluation with belief fixation and thus hides that it either abandons its Pragmatic promise or else abandons its anti-relativistic promise.  But, hey, if being a relativist ensures my survival then maybe relativism is true, right?

The upshot here is this: if you want to ""read up,"" then read Peirce and James and Dewey (and their modern adherents like Haack, Putnam, Rorty, Rescher, etc.).  Haack in particular is likely to be an enemy of Peterson, since she thinks James' theory of truth is hot garbage and that Rorty isn't a pragmatist.

So, onto part (b).  It sounds like what you want to know, potentially, is what to do after you do all your homework.  It sounds like you want to develop arguments to posit to this interlocutor such that you might demand a response.

If this sort of thing is enjoyable for you, then by all means do it.  But, please, don't expect this to work.  The only think more dangerous than an undergraduate who thinks he understands a theory (like your buddy) is an undergraduate who thinks they can change the mind of another undergraduate.

It sounds be obvious enough that your buddy can't really hold Peterson's theory as true in some substantial way, since it isn't even clear that it can be articulated or defended.  It's a few scattered sentences which can mean a bunch of different things.  Your buddy isn't giving responses to your counter-arguments from the theory since the theory doesn't provide them.  He's just inventing *ad hoc* shit as a way to circle the wagons around his commitments.  To borrow a phrase from James - he's just re-arranging his prejudices.

Don't get me wrong, when I was an undergraduate all I did was engage in full-on-offensives against people with inchoate views, but I'd recommend re-thinking this strategy unless you're engaging in it knowing how self-serving it is.

I have suggested this in the past, but if you really want to change your friends mind, then what you should do is ask them to explain the theory in question.  Clear your brains out of anything but your intuitions and a little logic, and then ask to be converted.  If the theory was really a good one, you'd accept it, right?  Well, let's get the arguments for it.  It turns out that the theory can barely be explained and, embrassingly, it can more easily be explained than justified (and Peterson pretty clearly confuses these two things too).  Why argue when you can interview?  People who cleave to Peterson are eager to argue - they're eager to self-defend.  At the risk off too much arm-chair psychology, we're talking about people who just accepted a theory of truth which justifies calling things true because they help us survive.  Imagine the kinds of magical thinking that this justifies.  If you want to create cognitive dissonance in an interlocutor, you won't likely get it with counter-arguments.  Any half-clever person can rationalize away a good objection (and easier to do if you're very clever).  Just ask a lot of polite questions.  Be the kind of interlocutor you wish they were."
369,AskPhilosophy,How do I learn to stop taking every text I read at face value?,"> Is this a normal part of the process?

Yup!

> Is there a way to start thinking logically about what I read?

Sounds like you're doing it!

I mean, if you're getting into philosophy for the first time and reading some of its great works, then it's probably true that, one, you don't have much in the way of significant ideas of your own you can defend on these topics, and, two, you're encountered deeply important, well-conceived ideas. It's quite natural, under these conditions, to be getting increasingly confused about what you thought you knew, and getting increasingly appreciative of the weight of the alternative ideas you're encountered.

If this *wasn't* happening, that would be a bad sign, and you'd have to -- if you wanted to make progress -- try to figure out what's holding you back. If this *is* happening, then keep going deeper: don't stop until you're totally doubting everything you thought you knew, and you can convince yourself and anyone you talk to of the plausibility of each alternative position you've studied, and you're left in dismay at what to do about this.

This is the ""preliminary"" stage in philosophical development. It usually takes a few years of committed work."
370,AskPhilosophy,Where does the dislike of philosophy in the natural sciences come from?,"I'm a scientist and I've also noticed this, but I've also noticed it going the other way too.

STEM people tend to think that philosophy is just esoteric nonsense, and philosophy people tend to think STEM people are just acting as mechanical tools of the power structure.

The problem as best I can determine is the educational system.  It doesn't do a very good job at giving a well rounded understanding, instead of just channeling into job specialization.  So I think students get tunnel vision as they are learning about their field on both sides.  I try to encourage my scientist colleagues to engage with more philosophy and most of them end up enjoying it.  I've also had a friend that was a philosophy major that wasn't into science until he took a philosophy of science class, and then he wanted to minor in a science field.  There's a lot of potential here if we worked together more.

Also being a scientist, it is very frustrating when I read philosophy about science that doesn't fit with how scientists actually practice science or actually think about science.  And I'm sure the uninformed opinions of STEM people on the ""soft"" sciences isn't useful either.  I think there should be a dialogue between the 2 fields, because in my mind science is just philosophy applied to the natural world (or a reproducible experimental model).  STEM stuff can help to keep philosophy grounded and philosophy can keep the STEM fields from going into regressive or oppressive directions."
371,AskPhilosophy,Is it possible that our world has simply become too complex and intertwined to ever really change and a lot of politics is just for show?,"Beaudrillard has lots to say about this.

372,AskPhilosophy,To what extent am I morally and ethically responsible for the slave labor use to make products I consume?,"Looks like there's been a lot of deleted comments. Yikes! Well you'll often hear leftists express the sentiment ""there is no ethical consumption under capitalism."" The idea is regardless of whether the company engaged in human rights abuses during the production of their goods, capitalism is itself based on the exploitation of labor. that is, the laborers are not paid the full value of their labor because the capitalist who owns the means of production extracts some of that value for themselves.

Whether this is ethical or not is the subject of debate. I'm not going to use this sub to endorse a political view, just describing the view.

To answer your question more directly, the answer is yes, by participating in the economy, we are all implicated in the destruction that our economy creates.

 This view does not even require the endorsement of leftism to be accepted. Even conservative writers like Wendell Berry (whether he identifies as conservative or not, people have called him such) have said this very thing. See his books What are People For? and The Unsettling of America."
373,AskPhilosophy,If chimps held slaves would we be morally obligated to intervene?,"> Let's say there were chimp castes

First off, there essentially are, though obviously with differences from the structures of human castes. And they are treated horrendously, not necessarily in the form of slavery (by human definitions of the term), but rather often in the form of being outcaste or simply killed by those ""at the top"".

Alternatively, we could pose your question from the other side of the equation: would an alien species far more advanced than us be obligated to forcefully stop our many ongoing crimes against each other? 

Or, we could keep the question more grounded and simply examine the long running debate on the morality of different forms of cross-cultural intervention within the human species. While there is ongoing debate, our general worldwide application of intervention policy allows for one culture to engage in actions that are lawful in their culture/society even though said action is outlawed in another culture/society and the other culture is deterred by international law from intervening in such cases, with some exceptions. There are human cultures and societies who currently practice various forms of slavery and they are allowed to do so by the international community, that is to say: in practical application we do not intervene in such cases, and the decision not to intervene rests upon a few centuries of development in international law based on long running arguments in the field of moral and political philosophy.

In regards to animals, the debate essentially boils down to the central question of whether animals are due the same moral value as we apply to humans (see the long running debate on that subject). 

If one assets to the arguments that animals ought to be given the same moral value as humans, then we can simply lump animals into the ongoing debated on the ethics of interventionist policy without necessarily changing the core nature of that debate, though with necessary changes in particulars (i.e. do we recognize ""chimp culture or society"" in the same ways and by the same standards we use to recognize various human cultures or societies, and thus afford them the same protections from intervention that we currently allow across human cultures, or do we have to come up with other manners of classifying ""culture"" in other animal species, etc etc). 

If one doesn't assent to the arguments for giving animals the same moral value as humans (as is our current practical agreement among human cultures), then we have to examine what degree of moral value and thus what degree of protections we afford different animal species, and that is of course another huge aspect of the moral debate around animal rights and animal welfare (for which, see Singer and many others)). 


So your question is a particular that rests upon a few much bigger and wider questions in moral philosophy, and the answer to your question will depend on what conclusions one comes to in that debate. So, one would have to begin with a study of the arguments related to animal rights and animal welfare and combine that with a study of arguments related to the questions of interventionist policy. Two huge topics."
374,AskPhilosophy,Is reading illegal PDFs of books immoral?,"The other comments haven’t focused on the morality of the laws in the first place. In getting to your answer, I would first ask the following question:

Are the laws that are in place that make downloading and reading the PDF illegal made for moral purposes in the first place? Were they written with the expressed purpose of providing moral guidelines? 

It seems to me asking if breaking the law is immoral rests upon the argument that the law is moral (or a situational definition of morality) in the first place.

Or is your question something more like “Is reading a book without paying for it, thereby ensuring the author did not get paid by me for their services, immoral?” If that’s more what your question is, then the argument would be different than the argument for “Is breaking the law immoral”."
375,AskPhilosophy,Why is Ayn Rand looked down upon by the philosophical community?,"I think most philosophers are more likely not to have Rand anywhere on their radar, rather than looking down upon her. Though, when external circumstances put her on the radar, it's probably fair to say she isn't usually received favorably.

But it's not clear why we would expect her to be well and favorably known in the philosophical community in the first place. She didn't pursue an education in philosophy, didn't pursue any teaching positions in philosophy, and didn't pursue scholarly publications in the field. So even at first glance, we wouldn't expect her to be a known and significant quantity in philosophy.

Besides these sorts of considerations, there are some problems, in the first place, with her methodology. When philosophers appraise a piece of writing meant to make a scholarly contribution they, like other academics, are inclined to look for clearly stated theses, being defended by independently appraisable evidence and argument, and situated in relation to the problems facing the field in question. And this isn't what one tends to find in Rand. At the level of methodology, one typically gets the impression of reading an editorial or journal rather than scholarly work. And again we would expect this to place her work outside the scope of the academia simply on methodological considerations.

Besides this, there are issues of substance. For instance, where she discusses other philosophical work, most infamously that of Aristotle and Kant, she gets the details of this work egregiously wrong. And the methodology issue is again significant here: because we don't get citations or references to other scholarship, which might otherwise help us make sense of what is going on, we're confronted with what seems to be off-the-cuff editorializing which fails to make any significant contact with the material it's ostensibly about.

Besides all of these concerns, it's not clear what from her work could count as a significant contribution to our philosophical understanding. Her work is often a source from which many young people first get exposed to a certain strand of conservative economic and political thinking, and she is probably most widely known in this context. But these sorts of ideas have able defenders among philosophers whose work doesn't suffer from the faults Rand's does.

And this is significant, to counter the canard that the academia doesn't like Rand simply because it cannot tolerate fiscally conservative ideas. Philosophers like Nozick and Narveson have much more ably defended such ideas and have never been disregarded the way Rand has. Indeed, significantly, it's often from these very sources that we get the most sustained philosophical criticism of Rand: see Nozick's ""On the Randian Argument"" and Narveson's ""Ayn Rand as Moral and Political Philosopher.""

That said, she certainly remains significant as a popular writer, which is far from a negligible accomplishment, and though rather on the fringe there are some philosophers who are constructively interested in her ideas."
376,AskPhilosophy,"Slavoj Zizek and Noam Chomsky are famous for having disagreements at pretty abstract levels, arguing both about the role of theory and practice in critical philosophy; AND each about the results of the other's discipline. Can somebody help to contextualize and explain these further to me?","There's a lot of ways into this, but one helpful way of thinking about the difference would be their conception of ideology, political consensus and their relationship to subjectivity. Chomsky (often in collaboration with Ed Herman) has written massive amounts detailing the ways in which much mainstream news/media outlets generate various forms of consensus around certain political movements and the nature and meaning of Western (usually American) intervention. He consistently demonstrates how mainstream media only allows a very limited spectrum of positions to be argued for on the airwaves, limiting Americans horizons for critically understanding reality. Zizek doesn't have a problem with this, but would add, particularly from his Lacanian perspective, that subjects not only experience a certain set of epistemological frameworks that limit their perspectives (limitations media can exploit in order to generate consensus around certain political orientations), but also form their identity around these orientations, often deriving a perverse sort of enjoyment from them. For example, Chomsky might say that the reason we're failing to address climate change is that the reality of climate change is being obscured, which is absolutely true, but Zizek would add that there's an added ideological component often at work. Conservatives might oppose eco-friendly initiatives because they view things like big pickup trucks and SUV's as a fundamental part of the American way of life. Liberals on the other hand might find this position revolting, but might attach themselves to a certain fatalism about climate change, deriving a perverse enjoyment in the misery of realizing there was nothing that could've been done.

An example Zizek often refers to that might clarify is the film *V for Vendetta*, where in the end the citizens realize they've been duped and so revolt, to which Zizek would say that people don't simply see new facts and change accordingly. Instead, transformations like this often happen at the level of identity, where one needs to rethink such fundamental things that many people prefer to simply stick to their beliefs, not because they necessarily think they are true but because there's a certain psychological comfort that can come from sticking to something, even if it's something that causes you pain.

Political transformations for Zizek then require more than simply bringing the truth to the people; it requires rewiring our very identities, achieving what Jacques Lacan called 'subjective destitution', wherein ""*the subject no longer presupposes himself as subject*; by accomplishing this he annuls, so to speak, the effects of the act of formal conversion. In other words, he assumes not the existence but the *non-existence* of the big Other, he accepts the Real in its utter, meaningless idiocy; he keeps open the gap between the Real and its symbolization.""

378,AskPhilosophy,Is our understanding limited by our language?,"Language evolves over time, adding new words and concepts and metaphors. Mathematics is a type of language, a language of abstract relationships, and it evolves over time as well. Theoretical mathematics covers much more than is realized in the physical world, but is a rich area for new mathematical tools. Often an obscure theoretical mathematical relationship will be used to better understand and model a physical system. A simple example is non-Euclidean geometry being applied to understand geometrical relationships on the Earth (e.g. great circles for air travel, etc.), and also the ""shape"" of the universe (i.e. Euclidean = flat, non-Euclidean = elliptic/hyperbolic).

https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-the-geometry-of-the-universe-20200316/

Outside of mathematics, natural language also evolves over time. Color concepts are a well studied example, with different cultures having different color categories, as well as different color categories emerging over time in a given culture. These color categories in language affect perception of color. The Himba tribe in Africa can distinguish more colors of green than many English speaking individuals, and had less success in differentiating the color blue.

For what it's worth, I think it's helpful to keep these two things separate in your mind:

1) The ""just doing my job"" defense, which is used to respond to accusations that you've done something directly wrong. So for instance being a guard at a concentration camp is doing something directly wrong.

2) The notion of collective responsibility for a society's actions, which is relevant to whether people who aren't doing something directly wrong might still be implicated. So for instance, I am not a guard at at ICE concentration camp, but I am a US citizen. So if I'm morally responsible for the camp, it's not a matter of attacking the ""just doing my job"" defense, since that's not my job.

381,AskPhilosophy,Is it morally/ethically correct to enjoy one's riches when there is so much poverty around?,"Sorry for the long response here, but it doesn't even begin to cover the debate on this topic. Also, I'll state upfront that I have a 'bias' on this issue in that I do think we are obligated to give away substantial parts (at the very least, 10%) of our income to charities. 

Anyway, as /u/drinka40tonight said, there's a ton of literature on this and Peter Singer's ""Famine, Affluence, and Morality"" is the best place to start. 

Singer's basic argument relies on what is known as the 'principle of sacrifice'. There are a few versions of this principle. The first two versions are suggested by Singer in the article:

1. If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.
2. If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing *anything* of moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.

We could also weaken this principle more by saying ""If it is in our power to prevent something *very* bad from happening..."", since dying from poverty is *very bad.* 

He tries to give support for the principle of sacrifice by showing how it can be used to explain another moral judgments we have. Imagine that I am walking past a pond and see a child drowning in it. I could easily walk in and save the child. Most of us would agree that I am obliged to save the child, even if I have to ruin my expensive clothes by going into the pond. He thinks that the principle of sacrifice is what explains this obligation.

But the principle of sacrifice seems to apply to other cases too. 

Let’s consider another case: Someone is starving to death because their country is going through a famine. You have money that you could send to them and save their lives. And this is just extra money that you have lying around, money that you were going to spend on stuff that is just as morally insignificant as clothes (for example, going out to dinner, entertainment, nice new furniture, video games, etc.) 

So now it seems like if you don’t send in that money, you have done something just as immoral as if you had let the kid drown. 

This is because it was in your power to prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing smothering of comparable moral importance, but you didn’t stop that thing from happening. 

Singer spends the rest of the paper dealing with potential objections to this idea. Peter Unger also wrote a book called *Living High and Letting Die: Our Illusion of Innocence* that outlines a lot of similar thought experiments that seem to support Singer's point (although Unger also argues for something called 'contextualism' in ethics in that book, but I won't get into that).

There have been a lot of responses and arguments against Singer. For example, John Arthur argued that the ideal moral code would leave room for people to get to keep the money they earned; we need principles of desert in our moral code. John Kekes argues against Singer on grounds of, among other things, responsibility (he suggests that we shouldn't have to take responsibility for the global poor if they are doing stuff like using poor birth control methods). 

So people like Arthur and Kekes are arguing for moral options (options to favor our own interests over the greater good), and particularly, they are arguing for limits on our positive duties (roughly, positive duties are duties to assist others, and negative duties are duties not to harm or unduly interfere with others). 

Some philosophers have (often indirectly) responded to these sorts of objections (and some of them are more directly responded to by Singer and others). For example, Thomas Pogge thinks that our duty to help the global poor is actually a *negative duty* (and calls into question, indirectly, Arthur's assumption that we deserve our money). This is because he thinks that ""bad leadership, civil wars, and widespread corruption in the developing countries are not wholly homegrown, but strongly encouraged by the existing international rules and extreme inequalities. The rulers and officials of these countries have vastly more to gain from catering to the interests of wealthy foreign governments, corporations, and tourists than from meeting the basic needs of their impoverished compatriots."" 

On a more abstract level, Shelly Kagan argues (in *The Limits of Morality)* that we actually don't have moral options and that we are actually always obligated to support the greater good (although this is an extremely controversial viewpoint).

If anyone is still reading this, there's a final work that I might point you towards related to this debate. I think a lot of us feel like giving all our extra resources to help the global poor is just really demanding-- it asks too much of us. Kagan and Singer don't think this is a very convincing sort of reply (and Singer suggests that it might just amount to us saying that we don't want to do what's moral). However, if demandingness does seem like an important concern, William MacAskill (in his article ""Giving isn't Demanding"") supports a different version of the principle of sacrifice: that we should at least give away 10% of our earnings to help the global poor. A number of philosophers (such as Peter Singer, Thomas Pogge, and Derek Parfit) and members of the /r/effectivealtruism community) have gotten behind this basic idea and taken a pledge to donate 10% of their incomes: [https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/) 

Anyway, feel free to ask if you have any questions!"
382,AskPhilosophy,What is the remedy of believing every philosopher?,"You're not doing anything wrong. What's happening is that, when a philosopher's position is being presented sympathetically, you find yourself sympathetic to it, and when you read criticism of a philosopher's views, you find yourself agreeing with the criticism. That's fine and normal, *as long as* the reason you find yourself sympathetic to each is that you find the arguments for them at least somewhat compelling. The key is to train yourself to pay more attention to arguments than to conclusions. 

What you're going through is normal for a beginner to philosophy. It can be a useful period to you if you ask yourself: why do I find myself agreeing with this philosopher? As a rough rule of thumb: if you find that the answer to that question is typically some fact about how interesting you find the conclusion of the philosopher's arguments, that's not ideal. If you find that the answer to that question is typically some fact about how well the argument for the conclusion works, that's better. Same for when you're reading criticisms of the philosopher. If you find yourself thinking *turns out that philosopher believes something I find myself disliking*, that's not a great reason to disagree with the philosopher. If instead you find yourself thinking *turns out the philosopher's argument doesn't work as well as I thought it did*, then you're on the right track. 

Practicing reading in this way will help you, over time, come to be able to anticipate criticisms of a philosopher by finding flaws in their arguments before they are pointed out to you."
383,AskPhilosophy,"If men are obligated to recognize any children they have, should't they have a say in abortion?","With the way this is framed this isn't an abortion issue, but rather a child support issue.

The issue isn't so much, ""should men have a say in abortion if they don't want the child but have to support it"", the issue is more ""should people have to support a child that they do not want?"""

Its been a long time since I've read it, but to summarize it, he tackles the same topics you propose from a perspective of a completely organized society in favour of having the most free time, so everyone has to work as minimum as possible and can have the oportunity to grow and experience the world with total freedom. This isn't completly news at his time, because is part of the anarchist or anarcho-communist programme (see, for example, Kropotkin's The Conquest of Bread). Later, Russell develops his tought with more depth in Roads to Freedom.

As other people commented, you can think the world is as it is because big changes implies giving up things, and it's usually said that this is not possible to make without abrupt violence, which is socially condemned. The system as it is now is profitable for a small percentage of people whom excert violence in a socially accepted manner (through institutions like the police, the prison system, international funds, etc) to mantain the current distribution of power, which is exemplified in the distribution of work.

390,AskPhilosophy,"Dumb question, but how do I read philosophy? How do I effectively absorb and understand what I'm reading?","There are lots of different ways. The first thing you need to concede is that you won't understand a text the first time you read it, *especially* if this is a historical text as opposed to a contemporary philosophy article. I didn't understand Plato's *Phaedo* the first time I read it. It is now not an exaggeration to say I've read that thing over fifty times -- sometimes even in ancient Greek, from cover to cover. In 2018 alone I have read Plato's *Timaeus* multiple times. There are still things that are puzzling to me. 

There are things you can do to improve retention, which sounds like what you were going for in the title of your post. For starters, you can take notes. You can underline. You can make diagrams of the arguments. 

In the body of your post, you are talking about something more than retention: *understanding*. A lot depends on what resources are available to you. You can use the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. It's easier to start thinking about texts and ideas if you're talking to someone: are there friends you can read things with, or bounce ideas off? Are there reading groups you can join? Courses you can audit? 

Still, my biggest piece of advice is: don't be afraid of re-reading things multiple times. If these texts weren't hard, you wouldn't need to ask us about how to read them. "

Antinatalists, notoriously, argue that it's wrong, always, to bring anyone into existence. Perfectionists about reproductive selection think that, if you have a choice between bringing person A into existence, or person B, then you should choose the person who has the best chance at the best life. If A is healthy, for instance, but B has a high risk of developing a deadly disease, then you ought to select A.

392,AskPhilosophy,"If all knowledge were destroyed and had to be rediscovered, how would philosophy look different? How would it look the same?","There are a lot of topics that show up in philosophy from disparate cultures with not a ton of contact, such that we might expect to see those topics recur. So for instance questions about knowledge: what is it, how do we get it, why does it matter that we have it, etc. Questions about morality: what is the right thing to do, why should we do the right thing, etc. Questions about the mind and the body: how are they related, what are they, what happens to them after death, etc. Questions about politics: how should the state be organized, etc. Questions about logic: if one is committed to one thing, what can we say about what else one is committed to, etc. Given how commonly these show up in many places and times I think it would be reasonable to expect them to show up again.

Beyond that I am not sure there is much useful that can be said. There is a lot of philosophy. How much of it would recur? Nobody can really say. If you're willing to squint hard enough, all of it would recur. If you're willing to be strict enough about what counts as the same, much of it would not recur. And then there's a vast area between squinting and being strict, an area in which some of it would recur and some of it wouldn't, but there's nothing much one can say about what would and wouldn't recur, since that's all largely contingent on factors that you've left unspecified in your hypothetical."

No, it certainly has, Nietzsche saw 'too much reason' as a real problem.

>What distinguishes the common nature is that it unflinchingly keeps sight of its advantage, and that this thought of purpose and advantage is even stronger than its strongest drives; not to allow these drives to lead it astray to perform inexpeditious acts - that is its wisdom and self-esteem. **In comparison, the higher nature is more unreasonable - for the noble, magnanimous, and self-sacrificing person does in faet succumb to his drives; and in his best moments, his reason pauses.** An animal that protects its young at the risk of its own life or during the mating period follows the female unto death does not think of <langer and death; its reason likewise pauses because the pleasure in its brood or in the female and the fear of being deprived of this pleasure dominate it totally;** the animal becomes stupider than it usually is - just like the person who is noble and magnanimous**. Such persons have several feelings of pleasure and displeasure so strong that they reduce the intellect to silence or to servitude: at that point their heart displaces their head, and one speaks thenceforth of 'passion'. (Occasionally we also encounter the opposite, the 'reversal of passion', as it were; for example, somebody once laid his hand on Fontenelle's heart and said, 'What you have here, my clear sir, is also brains. ' 3) The unreason or odd reason ( Unvernunft oder Quervernunft) of passion is what the common type despises in the noble, especially when this passion is directed at objects whose value seems quite fantastic and arbitrary. He is annoyed by the person who succumbs to the passion of the belly, but at least he comprehends the appeal that plays the tyrant in this case; but he cannot comprehend how anyone could, for example, risk health and honour for the sake of a passion for knowledge. The higher nature's taste is for exceptions, for things that leave most people cold and seem to lack sweetness; the higher nature has a singular value standard. Moreover, it usually believes that the idiosyncrasy of its taste is not a singular value standard; rather, it posits its values and disvalues as generally valid and so becomes incomprehensible and impractical. It is very rare that a higher nature has enough reason left over to understand and treat commonplace people as what they are; above all, it believes in its own passion as something that is present in everyone but concealed, and in this belief it is full of ardour and eloquence. Now when such exceptional people do not themselves feel like exceptions, how can they ever understand the common natures and arrive at a proper estimate of the rule! - and so they, too, speak of the stupidity, inexpedience, and fancifulness of humanity, stunned that the world is taking such an insane course and that it will not commit itself to that which 'is needful'. - This is the eternal injustice of the noble.

>**The greatest danger**. - Had there not always been a majority of men who
felt the discipline of their heads - their 'rationality' - to be their pride,
their obligation, their virtue, and who were embarrassed or ashamed by
all fantasizing and debauchery of thought, being the friends of 'healthy
common sense', humanity would have perished long ago! The greatest danger that hovered and still havers over humanity is the outbreak of
madness - that is, the outbreak of arbitrariness in feeling, seeing, and
hearing; the enjoyment in the lack of discipline of the head, the joy in
human unreason. The opposite of the world of the madman is not truth
and certainty but the generality and universal bindingness of a faith; in
short, the non-arbitrary in judgement. And man's greatest labour so far
has been to reach agreement about very many things and to lay down a
law of agreement - regardless of whether these things are true or false.
This is the discipline of the head which has preserved humanity - but
the counter-drives are still so powerful that it is basically with little
confidence that one may speak of the future of humanity. The picture of
things still moves and shifts continually, and perhaps more and faster
from now on than ever before; continually, the most select minds bristle
at this universal bindingness - the explorers of truth above all! Continually this faith, as a commonplace belief shared by everyone, breeds
nausea and a new lust in subtler minds; and the slow tempo for all
spiritual processes which this faith makes necessary, this imitation of the
tortoise that is recognized as the norm here, would by itself be sufficient
to turn artists and poets into deserters: it is these impatient minds in
whom a veritable delight in madness breaks out, because madness has
such a cheerful tempo! What is needed, then, are virtuous intellects -
oh, I'll use the most unambiguous word - **what is needed is virtuous
stupidity**; what is needed are unwavering beat-keepers of the slow spirit,
so that the believers of the great common faith stay together and go on
dancing their dance: it is an exigency of the first arder which commands
and demands. We others are the exception and the danger - we stand
eternally in need of defence! - Now there is certainly something to be
said for the exception, provided it never wants to become the rule.

If you mean why are philosophical writings written in a manner that you're not used to reading, usually the answer is that you're not used to reading philosophy--which is, of course, the context of most philosophical writings. The good news is that if you keep reading philosophy, this is a problem that solves itself.

Depending on the case in question, this factor may be complicated by their writing in a different language than the ones you speak, their writing in a different historical period than that you're familiar with, and their writing in a different cultural context than that you're familiar with. Though the same good news largely applies here: the more you read material which challenges your present reading level, the more your reading skills will improve, and the less you'll struggle with these sorts of issues.

These are challenges which may be exacerbated in our current climate, insofar as primary and secondary education does not seem to be reliably teaching functional literacy to the level one might wish. But again, this is a problem that the individual can fix for themselves by committing to an ongoing habit of reading."
397,AskPhilosophy,Why do philosophers dislike new atheism?,"It's hard to answer generally for all philosphers, but I think that the dislike stems from the fact the new atheists are at best shallow in their attempt to engage with philosophical debates and ideas and at worst philosophically illiterate or downright hostile to the field of philosophy.

For example, Richerd Dawkins [bashing continental philosophy without even understanding what it is](https://pics.me.me/Facebook-da97fb.png) or Sam Harris writing a whole book on meta-ethics without addressing or citing the academic literature or experts in the field [because he believes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxalrwPNkNI&t=25m50s)[ it's boring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxalrwPNkNI&t=25m50s) (I recommend watching the entire video if you have time to spare, it's great).

398,AskPhilosophy,Why the disdain for utilitarianism?,"So, first, let's get a general statement of utilitarianism on the board. How about this: ""an act is right if and only if it maximizes happiness."" Now, we could get more precise, but we can use that as a working understanding.

Here are some of the issues that the utilitarian has to contend with:

1. Utilitarianism looks to make the notion of ""rights"" obsolete. For instance, tossing Christians to the lions in ancient Rome is bad for the Christian, but good for the Colosseum of Romans who are in ecstasy at the spectacle. If you have enough ecstatic Romans, then it looks like it's good, given utilitarianism, to toss the Christian to the lions. 

2. Utilitarianism is too demanding. It seems to demand that that we always are to maximize happiness, in every action, at all times. And that's very, very, hard-- and hard in a way that seem to be too much of a cost for a moral theory.

3. Utilitarianism tries to put a single metric on value, and that's incoherent. Can we really compare the sort of value you assign to the life of your wife, with the value you assign to eating a Twinkie, with the value you assign to relieving yourself, with the value you assign to living the life of monk? For many people, it does not seem that all things that we value in life can be compared. e.g. I value twinkies. I also value my wife. How many twinkies is my wife worth to me? Utilitarianism asks questions like that all the time; for many people the question is ridiculous as a comparison is impossible. Some things differ in kind, not just in quantity. The point to be made is that the utilitarian assigns a single metric to all value, and that seem incoherent. The utilitarian says that the type of value got from scratching an itch is commensurable with the value of my wife. So, there will exist a relationship, such that some number times the value of itching a scratch equals the value of my wife. But, we might say, any equation looks wrong here. As Kant says, life has a dignity, and not just a price. The sorts of value involved here are incommensurable, if comparable.

4. Utilitarianism is under-specified, and when it is specified, those specifications are largely arbitrary. For instance, do we maximize aggregate happiness, or average happiness? Who is included? People, animals, future generations? How do we weigh ""high probability of little pleasure"" vs ""low probability of high pleasure""? Here's another problem: assuming we can calculate the relevant utils, how do we deal with time? Do we look a second ahead, a year ahead or a century ahead? But why stop at a century? Why not 101 years, or 500 years or 865.324 years, or the second before all sentient beings are extinct? The normative prescription provided by utilitarianism can change from instant to instant. So what do you make of a theory that tells you that a certain action will produce a net +10 utils at time t, a net -5 utils at t+1, a net +100 utils at t+2, a net -1000 utils at t+3, etc, etc? If net utility can change from instant to instant (and it obviously can), then utilitarianism is of no service to moral agents in deciding how to act or how to value an action.

5. Utilitarianism seems to be a self-effacing theory in that there seem to be situations where making utilitarianism the publicly accepted moral system would actually produce less utility. So, utilitarianism might very well be a theory that works best if no one is thinking about it....very odd.

6. Related to 5. Utilitarianism tells us that an act is right if and only if it is optimific in regard to pleasure and pain. But you can't embody this reason in your motive for acting, and still have friends, loved-ones, etc. Under utilitarianism, you don't value your friends as *friends*, you value them as sources of pleasure; they are replaceable -- anything with the same effects on us will suffice. So, when you try to embody utilitarianism in your motives, you find that the person you supposedly love engages your thought not for him/her but as a source of pleasure. To embody in one's motives the values of utilitarianism is to treat people externally and to preclude love, affection, community. To get *these* goods while holding utilitarianism requires a schizophrenia between reason and motive. To the extent that you live utilitarianism, you will fail to achieve goods like friendship, love, inquiry -- and these are goods that the utilitarian himself recognizes as good. The objection is that you cannot embody your reason in your motives, as a utilitarian. The utilitarian says that friends, and love are goods. But you can't achieve these goods, while simultaneously embodying your reason in your motive.
     
     Compare to the egoist: egoists take their own pleasure as the sole justification. From this, they should recognize the love, etc as among personal pleasures; so they have good reason on their own grounds to enter such relations. But when they act on their motive of pleasure-for-self they can't get those pleasures; to achieve these pleasures they have to abandon their egoistical motive. the egoist can't get the pleasures of love and friendship. For, it is essential to the very concept of love that one care for the beloved, and be prepared to act for the sake of the beloved as a final goal. But to the extent that my consideration for you comes from my desire to lead a life that is personally pleasing, I do not act for your sake. So their motive and reasons pull apart. So, to get these goods they have to lead a sort of schizophrenic life.

     Here's sort of how Wolf understands the point: the utilitarian values these things only because of and insofar as they are a part of the general happiness. He values them under the description, “a contribution to the general happiness.” In contrast, real people might love, say, literature, because of the insights into human nature, or, growing roses because they are beautiful. Sure this may contribute to happiness, but this isn't the point to the non-utilitarian. For if one values these activities in more direct ways, one may not be willing to exchange them for others that produce an equal, or even greater amount of happiness. From that point of view, it is not because they produce happiness that these activities are valuable; it is because these activities are valuable in more direct and specific ways that they produce happiness. So, the utilitarian can't value things in the right way.


So, those are some basic problems. I should note, though, that utilitarians are smart people, and can give responses. One of the big responses you'll see is that ""utilitarianism is not a decision procedure!"" By this, the utilitarian means that you should take the theory as reporting when actions are ""good"" and when they are ""bad."" So, on this reading, we shouldn't use the theory of utilitarianism to decide how to act on particular occasions. (Indeed, many utilitarians grant that, in deciding how to act, it is counterproductive to consult the theory of utilitarianism). Moreover, just because it's difficult to determine what action maximizes happiness isn't a mark against the theory -- it just shows we are limited in our knowledge. Moreover, utilitarians will be utilitarian about how they assign praise and blame. So, for instance, say I jump in the water and, unbeknownst to me, save Hitler Jr., who goes to murder a bunch of people. Well, utilitarians might still praise my act as the right one (since, they want to promote saving drowning folk), even though my action was actually ""bad"" (since it led to a decrease in utility). Another way to see the same point: just because I do a bad action, doesn't mean I should be blamed for it, since whether or not I'm to be blamed is something we have to think about along utilitarian lines.

Some of the more spelled out versions are interesting and deep. But, the sort of utilitarianism you see in economics, law, public policy, and some philosophy doesn't sit well with me. To me, it reeks of a sort of ""spurious rigour,"" where we mistake quantification and calculation for cogency of thought. It might be a great moral theory for omniscient beings (though even this is in question). But for those of us who lack that quality, utilitarianism may be seen as just a device to cloak moral bias with the guise of mathematical certainty. There's definitely more to be said, but I'll end there for now."

Does psychoanalysis have a complicated relationship with the empirical sciences? Yes. But rumors of its death are greatly exaggerated.

EDIT: I can also share anecdotally that having lived in Paris for over a year, you can't walk a block in many neighborhoods without passing one or several psychoanalyst's shingles. Several Freudian or Lacanian societies have active (daily) programming all year round in the city, well-attended by people ranging from college kids to retirees, and the section on Freud and Lacan at the bookstore (I'm thinking of Gibert Joseph, though this is true at many others) is about as big as the Ancient Philosophy section. New publications on psychoanalysis are displayed on the tables for casual shoppers. Radio shows and podcasts have psychoanalysts as guests all the time to pontificate about mass culture, gender roles, and relationship issues. The president of the country, Emmanuel Macron, worked closely as a student with philosopher Paul Ricoeur, who himself wrote one of the major studies on Freud's philosophical significance. If Freud has gone out of favor, Paris evidently did not get the memo."
401,AskPhilosophy,"(Why) does philosophy tend to focus on key thinkers moreso than topics/concepts, compared to other fields?","Philosophers care about precise details of arguments. For instance, there are many skeptics who think we can’t know anything. But they have different precise reasons - Hume worries about induction, Zhuangzi worries about dreams, Descartes worries about the possibility of an evil demon deceiving us, Pyrrho worries about the impossibility of giving a reason for every reason. Even when people say they accept a view for the “same reason”, there are often subtle differences in the details of the argument. Thus, we often recommend people see the actual details of the precise argument, and thus focus on the specific thinker."
402,AskPhilosophy,What is the best way to convince someone that Philosophy is not silly and is actually valuable for people in everyday life?,"Talk about ethics. People often don’t realise how unjustified a lot of their strong beliefs are, and pointing this out can help them to realise how philosophy can be useful. Ethics is a good topic to do this because there will be some part of it that everyone is invested in."
403,AskPhilosophy,Why would an all-knowing and all powerful god want to be worshipped?,"I won't put forward a serious explanation here, but just to put your question into context, if you listen to actual religious people or read either the Gita, the Quran or the Bible you must face the possibility as it's usually explained that it is us who need the grace or presence of God, not the other way around. The destiny of the religious depends on their relationship with the God, so even if it would seem to be a command, it is a pillar of faith and only an imperative as in building your own future - like saying ""you must connect this device to the outlet if you want to use it"" would seem to be a command but you should not forget about the conditional part."
404,AskPhilosophy,What changes happened that caused philosophers to go from overwhelmingly theistic to overwhelmingly atheistic?,"In sum: during the medieval period, philosophy was treated as secondary to theology: *philosophia ancilla theologicae est* [philosophy is the handmaiden of theology].  Starting with the Mersenne circle (esp. Hobbes and Descartes) in the mid-17th-century, philosophy started to take precedence over theology.  Cartesians and (in a *very* weird way) Hobbes were still Christians, and were trying to reconcile a new approach to philosophy with Christianity.  They are crucial for the changes that follow, but for simplicity I'll ignore their theologies.  All I will say is that Hobbes, Descartes, and other philosophers of their generation start to believe that each person is, on their own, is able to figure everything out for themselves.

Cartesianism then has two outgrowths: occasionalism *via* Malebranche, wherein God is bound by the nature he creates, and pantheism *via* Spinoza, wherein pantheism is true.  Another novel theology is ""deism,"" wherein God is a clockmaker: he made the world and then basically lets it alone.  These not only challenge the standard Christian theologies of the medieval and renaissance periods (obviously), but actually start to permit less and less theistic accounts of the world: For Malebranche, God is extremely limited because He limited himself by the rational order.  For Spinoza, God is everything, not some foreign entity.  For deists, God just doesn't do squat.  

When you create this increased skepticism about God's authority with the idea that we really don't need God to explain most things, you start to have philosophers decreasingly dependent on theism.  And without a dependence on theism, atheism can become more popular.

Obviously, I am oversimplifying an *incredibly* nuanced issue.  I'm only addressing two lines of the historical narrative, when I should also discuss (*among other things*) the rise of materialism, Protestantism's internal incoherence (keep in mind that most major Enlightenment-era philosophers were deeply moved by developments in Protestant theology), the Catholic Church's failure to really understand the challenges She was facing, and the rise of national sovereignty (because suddenly religion becomes a lot less central to persons' identities).  However, because you're asking for an ELI5, I'm trying to keep the explanation as minimal as possible :)

A good book I recently started on this issue, by the way, is Jonathan Israel's *Radical Enlightenment*."
405,AskPhilosophy,"I haven't consented to being born, so why is being euthanised/dying on my own terms not looked at the same?","Death is the same as birth insofar as it's not a contingent experience. You don't get to consent about death. You have to die no matter what just as much as you had to be born. What you can consent to is how you die and when.

This difference plays a big role in the moral considerations for euthanasia and suicide.

406,AskPhilosophy,Why people assume they are smarter than philosophers?,"/u/Tychocelchuuu's two points are good ones, though it seems like the first point ends up being a bit parasitic on the second point in a lot of cases.  I certainly meet a lot of undergraduates who are deeply pessimistic about the ability of *any* mode of inquiry to give us anything but matters of opinion.

What's weirder, though, is the difficulty in explaining what's wrong with the apparent ease with which some (many) are willing to toss aside the views of philosophers.

It seems to be true in most fields (even philosophy) that most people in the past were wrong about a lot of stuff and since many of the philosophers we still read (especially in undergraduate classrooms) are long dead people, it's not unreasonable to think that most of those thinkers are, on the whole, wrong about quite a bit.

For example, given that both Aristotle and Plato both worked for a really long time on the same philosophical problems and disagreed about quite a bit, then at least one of them is wrong about quite a lot.

Philosophers tend not to be bothered by this very much because of a difference in how they understand philosophy and how many people understand the goals of other inquiring enterprises. Certainly philosophy is interested in finding answers to questions, but given the difficulty (and maybe impossibility) of finding *final* answers, philosophers tend to be very interested in how arguments hang together or how approaches get started or where certain assumptions lead us.  So, even a philosopher who we think has very bad conclusions or very bad assumptions may tell us something rather interesting.  This is not how we approach a field like chemistry (or whatever), in general.  Certainly we can approach chemistry this way (like historians or philosophers of chemistry do)!  But, as a matter of practice, we are instrumentalists about most sorts of inquiries.

Some argue that this is at least, in part, driven by a wrong-headed framing of the practice of critical thinking - which, under certain descriptions, invites people to actively remain skeptical of experts.  (Huemer has argued that this sort of critical thinking is ""epistemically irresponsible.""  David Hayes has argued something similar.)

Certainly some (maybe even a lot) of the sorts of dismissals you're talking about are just classic examples of motivated reasoning or basic misunderstandings about what is being argued, but it does turn out to be difficult to explain where exactly such skepticism goes awry.  The classic kinds of ""we just have to take these guys seriously because they thought real real hard"" argument just doesn't hold much water past the first intuition - lots of people who thought real real hard ended up being super wrong and their having through real real hard should not dissuade us from thinking they could be or are wrong when we notice a problem in their thinking."
407,AskPhilosophy,"How should philosophers address fans of Jordan Peterson, Sam Harris, etc, when they think they know philosophy, but get the basics so wrong?","The problem with fans of people like Peterson is many of them have crossed the line from intellectual appreciation into subculture, with its own ways of speaking, thinking and discourse that often uses tautology or an implicitly agreed upon set of defences which are hard to puncture from the outside. Ironically it's remarkably similar to how small 21st century Trotskyist and Leninist groups work, and yet has taken on a mass character.

The best bet is to patiently explain their misunderstandings--if possible in person, not on the internet! And alongside correcting mistakes or misreadings, you need to try and reframe *and adequately explain* the issues they bring up in terms of more grounded and well-researched terminology. I think youtuber contrapoints has a good line on this--she argues that you can't pretend that Peterson fans are complete dupes. Any starting point for commensurable arguments has to begin with acknowledging there is a concrete reason that Peterson, Harris et al.'s ideas resonate in ways that properly sourced and researched philosophy doesn't. 

Finally as an aside I really think that social science has a good role to play in this alongside philosophy as it's a discipline more poised to explain some phenomena (Masculinity Crises, Islamism, Gender Pay Gap) that Peterson and Harris zone in on."
408,AskPhilosophy,Studying philosophy at university; a bad decision?,"People who study philosophy generally have no problems getting a job. If you are capable of seriously studying philosophy, you are capable of getting a job with a philosophy degree. I got a BA and an MA in philosophy and ended up an English teacher. That being said, your cousin shouldn’t put all his eggs in the philosophy professor basket. It is an insanely competitive field right now and very difficult to end up in a good position as an academic philosopher. 

As far as his parents go, he should show them statistics about earnings and employment for philosophy majors. Their bias against studying philosophy is grounded in ignorance, not reality. Whether they accept the reality of the situation is another thing altogether."
409,AskPhilosophy,Why is suffering bad?,"I'm actually writing my masters thesis on this very topic. Suffering is an inevitable part of life and so it makes sense to explore it philosophically – to train ourselves to make sense of it.

There's three schools of thought that I'm looking into: Nietzsche, the Stoics and Schopenhauer. Each understands suffering differently. I'd suggest reading about the thoughts of each when it comes to suffering. It's all very interesting and each makes valuable points that are worthwhile to consider. In summary, Schopenhauer sees suffering as completely negative and something to be avoided. The only way to ease our suffering is to withdraw from the world, take an ascetic life and avoid temptations and desires. Our suffering is due to this inner irrational force within us, our will (although will in this context is quite nuanced and it's crucial to understand what Schopenhauer means exactly). It's a force that compels us to blindly and pointlessly live on. The force driving us to breed. The impetus that causes the lion to rip through the antelope. The panicked frenzy to live on. Nietzsche, who wrote in reply to Schopenhauer basically says this is a flawed way to live and flawed way to understand our world. Instead, we must lean into suffering, use it to strengthen ourselves so that we can live and express ourselves in the way we want to. A will to power. The Stoics, believe much of our suffering can be reduced through practicing mindfulness, being wary of our expectations and incorrect imaginations of what is really happening. Furthermore, suffering leads to development, ""trials maketh man"" and a gem can't become shiny without friction. Maybe the mindfulness aspect is best summarised by this Marcus Aurelius quote, ""Endless suffering—all from not allowing the mind to do its job.""

I think it's essential for everyone to deliberate on suffering. Shifting our perspective alleviates and also makes sense of this inescapable part of life. Personally I find these views most transferable to the pursuit of physical development. Understanding the purpose of suffering and realising when it is also needless or avoidable. Suffering provides an opportunity for growth. ""The stronger the wind, the stronger the tree."" Hope that helped."
410,AskPhilosophy,"What does 'it' in ""It is raining"" mean? If it doesn't refer to anything, what would be an alternative sentence which expresses the same meaning?","In linguistics, we call it an ""[expletive particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expletive)"". It is a *placeholder* in the sentence's syntactic structure. In Portuguese, such a particle is not required. Thus, phrases like

(Eng) It rains.  
(Pt) Chove.

Are synonymous, though you can see there is no need in (Pt) for an expletive particle since it has a different syntactic structure, though they have the same meaning."
411,AskPhilosophy,Why does Chomsky claim that moral relativism is incoherent?,"It is trivially true that moral systems vary across space and time, and it is trivially true that there is variation in humans as in all biological organisms. But Chomsky argues that there are biological bounds and constraints on that variation, i.e. that moral systems can't be whatever and that observation of *some* variation does not justify the inference that the possibility for variation is *infinite*.

Chomsky's argument is basically this:

1. Moral values reflect culture
2. Culture is acquired from limited observations of one's peers, i.e. a fairly limited amount data
3. All individuals make the leap from this fairly limited amount of data to a (more or less) coherent moral system
4. This leap is only possible if we have pre-existing cognitive structures, much like the universal grammar that Chomsky argues is a prerequisite for learning a language

Chomsky is a [nativist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/innateness-cognition/), meaning that he argues for the innateness of certain aspects of our cognition. When he claims moral relativism is incoherent, he assumes one has to accept point 4 because without some innate structures the acquisition of culture becomes impossible. And if there are innate structures there are also constraints, meaning that the possible moral stances are finite. Hence strong moral relativism becomes an incoherent position. But it all hinges on the idea of some biological constraints on morality.

There are of course problems with nativism, which Chomsky doesn't really touch upon here. For example, he's not really making a good case for moral progress in the linked clip – he lists things that we now regard as unacceptable (i.e. oppression of women), but he doesn't really make the case for why this should be interpreted as us 'penetrating deeper into our real values' rather than moving further away from it. He argues that there has been a progression towards tolerance of variation and opposition to coercion, but there have arguably also been regressions (e.g. fascism, colonialism). And he doesn't discuss the fact that he could be accused of committing a [naturalistic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy) or [appeal to nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature)."
412,AskPhilosophy,"Why were so many modern philosophers (Kant, Kierkegaard, etc.) theists, while a large majority of contemporary philosophers are atheists?","Most philosophers throughout history have been theists of *some* kind, even the ones we'd call atheists (Epicurus, Lucretius come to mind) today. The modern sense of the word ""atheism"" as ""there is no god, no divine quality, no divine intelligence, no divine essence, no first mover, nothing at all"" is pretty recent. I'd keep this in mind when sorting philosophers into boxes labeled ""atheist"" and ""theist."" The meanings have shifted. In some cases (Spinoza) they're not particularly useful."
413,AskPhilosophy,"Is the quote by Nietzsche: ""there are no facts only interpretations"" an example of postmodern philosophy?","A lot of people actually consider Nietzsche a proto-postmodernist since he influenced many thinkers, such as Foucault. I would be careful confusing relativism with postmodernism though, postmodernism is better thought about through thinkers as opposed to ideas in order to avoid misinterpretations or generalizations."
414,AskPhilosophy,"I work as a barista in a coffee shop. A woman comes in every day, sits there for the entire evening and during her stay drinks 1,5+ bottles of wine. Is it morally incorrect for me to serve her every day since it’s obvious she has a drinking problem?","The amount of alcohol your customer is imbibing will accumulate as health issues including fatty liver, cirrhosis, etc. But, if she isn't driving or potentially  harming others then her choices aren't necessarily at a level where they should warrant intervention on moral grounds. If the customer was overweight and eating unhealthy foods and quantities of it, would that be a similiar set of circumstances?

Yours is an interesting question and perhaps a good motivation to learn more about alcoholism, addictions etc. Maybe you'll learn or discover ideas that might help your customer or if not her, maybe someone else whom you know or will meet in the future.

Stay positive and give yourself a pat on the back for caring about someone you don't know well."
415,AskPhilosophy,"Why was Immanuel Kant so captivated by Rosseau's ""Emile"" that he missed his afternoon walks?","It was particularly the part called 'profession de foi du vicaire savoyard' that influenced Kant. Kant took from Rousseau the idea that virtue (being good) isn't a science, that morality doesn't depend on knowledge, that being moral isn't a matter of knowing some privileged moral proposition. This lead to Kant exploring reason as being a *practical* faculty, rather than just theoretical. 

Rousseau taught him that although we're all unequal when it comes to our capacities for philosophical speculation and theoretical reasoning (for some people are more intelligent than others, never had the right education etc), we're all equal in our capacities to become *good*, we all share an equal moral and metaphysical dignity. Being moral is a matter of how we act, of the intention that forms our actions. In other words, it's not a matter of rationally knowing special moral truths that we become good, but rather by acting according to our conscience (which would become the moral law in Kants works). For Rousseau, having a conscience is part of being human, it's a natural feeling that inclines towards what's good, it's the feeling that pushes one to love and want the good, it's the inner voice of right and wrong that judges ourselves and others.  'One can be human (homme) without being a scientist (savant)' (Rousseau)."
416,AskPhilosophy,"What distinguishes a professional philosopher from an amateur, and what should amateurs learn from the professionals?","Great question. The money (or having some kind of advanced degree) is the distinguishing line in practice. So I'm taking your question to be more like ""what tools and skills do professionals have in their repertoire that non-professionals do not?""

Here's a quick, preliminary list:

* Professionals tend to be able to see several moves ahead in an argument, even those with which they disagree. This is to some degree from reading other philosophers, but mostly from having many, many conversations about the ""big questions"" before. In chess terms, you know the opening lines of most positions even if you don't like the position. 
* Professionals tend to understand that the great historical philosophers were writing in a tradition, to other philosophers. Their audience, for the most part, was not young, untrained, unread intellectuals. (Though there are exceptions here: Nietzsche and the existentialists and William James, most importantly.) So professionals know that one is going to be in for a lot of confusion if someone just picks up Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason* for personal enlightenment. Unfortunately the expectation that the great philosophers will give their readers wisdom is so strong that when it doesn't happen people get turned off to philosophy.
* Professionals (ok, good professionals) tend to be less interested in winning an argument than in sussing out a position's strength and weaknesses in general.
* Professionals tend not to subscribe to the ""great person"" theory of philosophical insight: the idea that to be a historically famous philosopher means you have special, secret wisdom or that your theories are somehow ""pure"" in a way that modern journal articles aren't. We tend to believe that philosophy is a giant conversation and that there are certainly voices that are stronger, but that they are stronger because of their reasons and arguments and challenges to the other major parts of the conversation. We defend and criticize historically famous philosophers like anyone else because for the most part we're all trained adequately to play the same game.
* Professional philosophers tend to know that great ideas are almost never totally novel. The same or a related idea likely occurs somewhere in the vast literature of philosophy. This isn't discouraging to professionals, but it often is to people new to philosophy. We get excited when there are people who know more than us about a position so we can connect to it, develop it, and draw from it. (And occasionally we figure out that everything we want to say has been said. Those are rough days :))
* Professionals tend to realize that the solution to philosophical problems isn't likely to be a ""voice from the wilderness"" that doesn't know the literature very, very well. (Wittgenstein and Kierkegaard may look like they're such voices, but both are very steeped in previous writing on their problems.) We believe it isn't likely because the problems themselves are rooted in the tradition and literature more than they are in general human experience. Philosophy as a whole tends to be about deepening the human experience rather than answering questions about it. And we're lucky that some questions seem to get answered along the way.
* Professionals tend to know that they don't really understand a position in philosophy until you can explain it to someone else, or teach it, or write about it in a way that others working with the position understand. I used to tell my first year graduate seminar's instructor that I really understood what Russell was trying to say, but I just couldn't put it in words. She told me that this meant I didn't understand what Russell was trying to say. I was really offended and almost quit the program because of what she said and her challenge to what I thought I understood. But I swallowed my pride and now I agree completely with what she said. It's made more of a difference than almost anything anyone else has taught me in philosophy.

Those are some big scale things. Here are some little things that are easier to master and would dramatically strengthen the philosophical community outside of academia:

* Mastering the following distinctions (and taking for granted that there are such distinctions to be made): a priori/a posteriori, prescriptive/descriptive, is/ought, epistemological/metaphysical, type/token, appearance/reality, truth/justification, analytic/synthetic, use/mention, sense/reference, necessary condition/sufficient condition, necessity/possibility, and noumenal/phenomenal.
* Personally, I think that getting clear on the difference between is/ought, prescriptive/descriptive, and truth/justification for everyone would open up a second enlightenment.
* Be more attached to figuring out the implications of your position than winning an argument. It's infinitely more satisfying and you'll end up winning more arguments anyway :)
* Find a journal at your local university that publishes articles for all audiences and look at some of the articles rather than just concentrating on the historically great philosophers. A great example is the journal just called *Philosophy*. I also really like *Philosophy Compass*, but it's getting a little less accessible lately.
* Go to a philosophy talk by a professor at a university. Fail to understand it. Repeat until you understand it. I'm a slow learner, but this took me two years after being a philosophy major in college. It all makes sense. You just have to get your background knowledge of the debates up to speed.
* Be humble. Read about science too. Get really good at something totally different than philosophy (because being good at philosophy helps shorten the learning curve on everything).
* (I'm going to get in trouble for this one, but...) For most philosophy students, I can tell how well they're doing in gaining the right skills by how worried much they understand compatibilism about freedom of the will. When they are no longer worried about determinism being compatible with free will, they tend to also be good at philosophizing. For whatever reason, ""How I learned to stop worrying and love the determinism"" tends to be a pretty good marker.

Hope that helps!"
417,AskPhilosophy,What are the most recent (last 10 years) NEW philosophical concepts?,"A bit older than 10 years, but 4E cognition. Embodied, enactive, extended, embedded. I like to throw in the 5th E of ecological too. Maybe somewhat newer are the REC versions, that is, Chemero's Radical Embodied Cognition and Hutto's Radical Enacted Cognition."
418,AskPhilosophy,"I was told by a student ethicist that most ethicists believe that morality is objective, but I can't get a straight, non-tautological answer for what this means. Can anyone help explain?","When we say that morality is objective we mean that moral claims (like ""X is wrong"") are true or false, and they are true or false in virtue of facts which do not depend on what we think, feel, believe, want, desire, or things like this. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/4i8php/is_morality_objective_or_subjective_does/) for more extensive discussion."
419,AskPhilosophy,How not to feel overwhelmed by the huge philosophical corpus ?,"In case you are interested in philosophy of science (or questions that have some sort of connection to your scientific work), it's probably worth it to ask some of the philosophy faculty if they want to do a reading group, informal seminar, or perhaps even a formal thing. Philosophers (of science) *live* for this! (One of my professor is affiliated with two research centers, another one is affiliated with the psychology department, which makes sense, cause philosophy of mind. I'm pretty certain that at least one of those affiliations came about because the scientists reached out. 

Another tip to give is to just give up on having a full overview. No-one can do that other than literally doing a PhD and several years of post-doc, and even then your knowledge will be limited. Find the questions you are interested in, read the textbooks on that, and then read the relevant contemporary literature. For example, if you were into epistemology, sure you can read Hume and Kant, and perhaps even some of the classics, but it may be much more interesting to jump forward a few hundred years, read Gettier and take it from there.

ETA: You could probably also convince the philosophy faculty to do, like, an ""intro to philosophy"" series for their peers in science. That would be very rad, you would get guidance from professional philosophers, and may actually end up having a few nice research projects after a while. I wouldn't expect that there is a single philosophy professor out there who wouldn't agree to do this /u/jean-porte"
420,AskPhilosophy,"I want to major in philosophy, but also don't want to be poor. Tell me...how do?","Despite the joke, a philosophy degree isn't mutually exclusive of a well-paying career after graduation. But, as with most other Bachelor degrees, it alone isn't a golden ticket to wealthy living.

A philosophy education can look extremely attractive to employers when paired with some other more specified education or work experience, and it's compatible with pretty much anything. You can dual major, take philosophy as a minor, study another subject after graduation, find work in an unrelated field and use the experience to coordinate into a career you want, etc. The possibilities are still very open with a philosophy degree, perhaps more open than others, if sold well to employers.

Considering that the job market is currently much better than it was when I graduated in 2008, I'm surprised that people still take this joke seriously.

EDIT: A relevant anecdote: My only other friend who studied philosophy with me at my university dropped out a couple years in but eventually married his girlfriend who he met there, recently bought a house, has a good paying job as a construction manager, and looked altogether happy when I saw him try out his meat smoker a few weekends ago. No life is the same and a degree in anything alone isn't going to be the decider of it."
421,AskPhilosophy,"In a democracy, how should we respond to those who have actively rejected reason and accountability, especially if their actions threaten the common good?","I can't speak for everyone, but the last couple years have made my misbegotten philosophy degree suddenly relevant.

> Are we justified in forcing them to conform to the demands of reasonable  behavior? Or does such an impulse represent a morally problematic  rejection of one of the basic norms of a liberal democracy? 

Liberal Democracy, at it's best, still assumes that populace would be well educated and up to the task of self government. The best articulation I've ever heard is that the \*right\* to self govern is innate, but the \*ability\* to self govern must necessarily be taught.

I don't think we can ""force"" people to confirm to demands of reasonable behavior, but we can ignore them. If people are displaying overt illogic (""Oh yeah, well what about...?"") or are dogmatically anti-empirical, we don't have to engage with them. We \*might\* even call them out on it once, maybe twice. But more than that, we might be taking a bait into their game. We're probably doing more harm than good if we're engaging with that kind of thing facebook, twitter, etc. Attention is currency after all. 

I have cut off people from my social media for those offenses to reason, after publicly calling them on it. That is not for their benefit. It's for the benefit of anyone watching.

Anyway, I don't know if that's the \*best\* plan. It probably isn't. That though, is what I have been doing."

423,AskPhilosophy,How can I conceptualize the way my cat thinks?,"Gregory Bateson uses the example of cats in particular to illustrate his theory that animal communication is largely communication about relations, rather than specific things:

""When your cat is trying to tell you to give her food, how does she do it? She has no word for food or for milk. What she does is to make movements and sounds that are characteristically those that a kitten makes to a mother cat. If we were to translate the cat’s message into words, it would not be correct to say that she is crying “Milk!” Rather, she is saying something like “Ma-ma!” Or, perhaps still more correctly, we should say that she is asserting “Dependency! Dependency!” The cat talks in terms of patterns and contingencies of relationship, and from this talk it is up to you to take a *deductive* step, guessing that it is milk that the cat wants. It is the necessity for this deductive step which marks the difference between preverbal mammalian communication and *both* the communication of bees and the languages of men.

What was extraordinary—the great new thing—in the evolution of human language was not the discovery of abstraction or generalization, but the discovery of how to be specific about something other than relationship."" (from ""Problems in Cetacean and Other Mammalian Communication"", in *Steps to an Ecology of Mind*). 

I always thought this was a pretty cool way of thinking about animal communication."
424,AskPhilosophy,"If someone performs selfless acts because they feel good for doing them, are they selfish?","Selfish, in the negative sense of the term, denotes someone who focuses exclusively on their own interests, with no regard for others’ interests. 

I don’t see how feeling good about your selfless acts on its own make you selfish."
425,AskPhilosophy,Why are people predisposed to thinking there are objective moral values but not objective aesthetic values?,"Probably because a functioning society relies on certain moral conditions, but not as much on aesthetic ones. There's a pragmatic consideration to outlawing murder or theft, but not as much bad art.

Or perhaps there are aesthetic conditions, but once they become problematic at a large scale, they become considered moral ones, e.g. violence in children's media, pornography, etc.

Or maybe it's that a consensus on broad moral issues is easier to reach, and aesthetic values are generally more ambiguous, so one appears more objective, and the other more relative.

Of course, none of these speculations preclude aesthetic values being objective, or moral values being subjective. I do know, however, that a quick way to offend someone is to criticize their taste. So to avoid being hurt, we might reinforce the idea that aesthetics is relative, so no one can ever be ""wrong."""
426,AskPhilosophy,Would anyone be willing to share their comprehensive philosophy major reading/study list with me?,"These are the one's I read during graduation :

Aristotle - Nicomachean Ethics, Plato - Republic, Descarte - Discourse on the Method, Hume - An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, Kant - Prolegomena to Future Metaphysics.

I've also studied other rationalists like Spinoza, Leibniz and the empiricists like Locke, Hobbes and Berkely which was covered with smaller readings and peer reviewed articles. I've never bothered with Aquinas and Anselm or any of the Christian texts before Descartes but I've studied Buddhist and Indic philosophy. There should also be aesthetics, ethics and logic as part of your course."
427,AskPhilosophy,Why did they have to prove 1+1 = 2 in formal logic?,"The question in logic and the foundation of mathematics has never been *whether* arithmetical truths like '1+1=2' are true, but what *makes* them true. Now, if we think that arithmetical truths depend solely on truths in some other domain D, then we would expect there to be truths about D that could furnish us with proofs in arithmetic. The role of the proof in this endeavor is not to assure us that arithmetical truths are true, but rather that their truth might be explained by the truth of some D-statements.

The logicist program in the foundation of mathematics contended roughly that the relevant domain is the domain of logical truth - i.e., that mathematical truths are true in virtue of certain logical truths, in particular truths in the theories of sets and types. In order to give substance to this thesis, one would like to be able to show that any token statement of an arithmetical truth, like '1+1=2', can, on the preferred analysis of that statement in the language of the (set or type) theory, be shown to follow from the axioms of that theory. So it was important for logicists to actually show that strictly set- or type-theoretic proofs could be given that would, on the right interpretation of the language of arithmetic, imply that '1+1=2' is true. Hence the need to 'prove' that 1+1=2, which itself was never in doubt.

EDIT: I do not understand why you are downvoting the guy below me. Philosophical pedagogy consists largely in encouraging the student to feel comfortable giving answers that may be wrong. Shaming people for being wrong is not only rude but also bad practice."
428,AskPhilosophy,Why is Friedrich Nietzhe often called a “nihilist” by most people. When he himself wasn’t one?,"A couple people have commented that Nietzsche is difficult to understand. I don't think that really captures the issue. Nietzsche wrote as if his reader had read everything he'd published in order of release. So, if someone just picks up Ecce Homo without having read the rest of his work,  they'll come to all sorts of weird conclusions about his philosophy. Remember, Nietzsche was also widely regarded as an anti-semite/proto-nazi despite having in several places clearly described a respect for the Jewish people and absolute disgust with German nationalism."
429,AskPhilosophy,Why do philosophers say that Immanual Kant’s ideas were like the Copernican Revolution of Philosophy?,"Its just a metaphor, or equivalence. The Copernican revolution was the paradigm shift in cosmology away from geocentrism. Kant's work was (according to this formulation) a paradigm shift in philosophy - especially in epistemology.

What was the Kantian paradigm shift? Instead of imagining our cognition conforms to experience, Kant asks: what if experience conforms to our cognition.

To this end, he described the 'transcendental apparatus' of our minds: the cognitive faculty that has (not just little bits of information but) a way of handling experience which intrinsically imposes an organisation or structure on our experience."
430,AskPhilosophy,Is it possible to believe something without being aware of it?,"In addition to what Tycho said it seems your friend is making a particular religious claim that everyone, inherently, 'knows God'. Presumably this is due to us being created in God's image and so on, and he's not necessarily making the same sort of claim that comes up in other discussions about implicit beliefs."
431,AskPhilosophy,"If someone was born with none of the 5 senses, would they be able to think and if so what would they be able to think about?","Give Avicenna's Flying Man thought experiment a look, if I recall correctly he argues for the existence of the soul on the basis that a person would still have some essential mental activity despite lacking all senses since birth. Not that I necessarily support his conclusion, and it has been quite some time since I properly looked at the argument so I may be misrepresenting it, but it is definitely worth looking into"
432,AskPhilosophy,How do I actually do philosophy when I'm reading philosophy? How do I critically examine the arguments in philosophical texts and essays?,Begin by restating the argument or idea in your own words. You may not get it exactly right. That's fine. You will get better with practice and as you get exposed to more philosophical ideas. Then pick out the strong and weak points of the argument. Are they enough to make you agree/disagree with the idea? Can you state your reasons for agreement/disagreement?
433,AskPhilosophy,"We usually attach a very negative connotation to ""overthinking."" But when philosophers do it, we praise them. Why?","Philosophers typically do directed thinking rather than overthinking. Directed thinking typically tries to solve a particular problem or build a particular structure. Besides philosophical thinking, examples may include thinking about science, math, engineering, and computer programming. Directed thinking is directed toward a goal, and it can be stopped when that goal is reached. Overthinking is so called, because it keeps going even when it should have already stopped.

For example, someone might worry about something so much that she can't get it off her mind and keeps thinking about it. This happens, because worry is focused on anticipating a problem rather than on dealing with it. As long as you don't actually deal with a problem, you can keep imagining different ways things can go wrong. When I'm debugging some computer code, I'm dealing with the specific problem that the code doesn't work as I intend it to. As I try to figure out what is wrong and make changes, I can then test the changes and see if the code works as I intend it to. When it finally does seem to work as intended, I can run some more tests to be sure, and if they all pass, I can stop. Philosophy works similarly. When writing a philosophical argument, a philosopher sets out to prove or provide good reasons for believing a particular conclusion. He normally has to anticipate and consider counter-examples and counter-arguments, but this is not the same as being confused about where he is heading and considering all possibilities as equally likely, as the worrier sometimes will. In the end, the philosopher will typically bring things to a conclusion he can stand behind, and with that, he will stop.

While overthinking is sometimes due to worry, it is also sometimes due to some kind of constitutional proclivity toward thinking. When someone is prone to thinking a lot, it helps to find specific problems to think about. By doing this, people can turn a tendency toward overthinking into the ability to get things done with directed thinking. Some people do this by focusing on philosophical problems. But a tendency to think a lot can also be directed toward abstract strategy board games, such as Chess, towards work in various other scientific or academic fields, or in various other constructive directions. The idea here is that when the mind has some involuntary tendency to keep on thinking to harness it towards a goal instead of letting it run wild on its own. Overthinking is like a wild horse running out of control. Philosophers try to rein in overthinking by directing their thinking toward specific goals."

435,AskPhilosophy,What are the philosophical mistakes that Jordan Peterson makes?,"There's a few issues with JBP's philosophy, or rather his takes on other's philosophy, which earns him a weak reputation. You've alluded to one or two here but I'll go into a little more depth.

**1. His knowledge of Postmodernism is flawed**

Peterson has indicated on numerous occasions that he either hasn't read any postmodernists or has read flawed secondhand accounts of postmodernist writers. Most infamously he has recommended Stephen Hicks' book ""Explaining Postmodernism"", which seems to be his primary source for his claims on Postmodernism. ""Explaining Postmodernism"" is, to put it bluntly, bad. It's assertions are often confused and outright incorrect at points. Among other things, the book claims that Kant was a thinker of the Counter-Enlightenment (he is considered the quintessential Enlightenment figure) and labels Andrea Dworkin and Catherine MacKinnon as postmodernists (they are both anti-postmodernist radical feminists). [This video goes into more detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHtvTGaPzF4) on this specific subject.

Now, of course one could argue that this is not a criticism of Peterson but of Hicks, and that would be a valid point. However, many of Peterson's claims mirror those in Hicks' book, and the fact that he routinely recommends it shows that he is basing his knowledge of postmodernism on an incredibly flawed text. Thus it can be concluded that his knowledge and critiques of postmodernism are based on flawed premises.

**2. His knowledge of Marxism is lacking**

In addition to postmodernism, a common target of Peterson's criticism is Marxism. And unlike postmodernism, he seems to have engaged with Marxist texts; or more accurately *a* Marxist text, as he revealed in his debate with Slavoj Zizek that the only part of the Marxist canon he has directly engaged with is ""The Communist Manifesto"". This is somewhat of a problem, as the Communist Manifesto is by no means a comprehensive text on Marxism. It's a political pamphlet which was written early in Marx and Engels' life with the purpose of getting across several key concepts in a quick and easy manner. It's also a very short text, only about 40 pages. All this is to say that one is hardly an authority on Marxism if their only exposure to it is the Communist Manifesto.

What makes Peterson's positions on Marxism even more weak is that despite reading the Communist Manifesto he somehow managed to get his own critiques of it wrong. In his aforementioned debate with Zizek, he claimed that Marx argued that capitalist society was made up solely of the bourgeois and proletariat, when within the Communist Manifesto itself Marx makes mention of other social classes, such as the peasantry, *lumpenproletariat*, aristocracy, and others. At another point in the debate, Peterson claims that Marx makes no mention of nature, yet humanity's relationship with nature is rather explicitly dissected in the Manifesto itself, not to mention that Marx and Engels wrote entire books/articles on nature, most famously in [The Part Played by Labour in the Transition From Ape to Man](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1876/part-played-labour/).

All this is to say that even though Peterson claims to have read the Communist Manifesto, it is clear he hasn't read it closely and possesses an incredibly lacklustre knowledge of Marxism.

**3. Brief Mention of Postmodern Neo-Marxism**

You have brought up Peterson's clarification of his comments on those he labels ""Postmodern Neo-Marxists"". Now, I may be wrong here and feel free to point out if I am, but as far as I can tell he only came up with that clarification around the time he did his Reddit AMA. This was already well after many people had chastised him for using such a contradictory term. This is speculation on my part, but based on his established lack of knowledge of both Postmodernism and Marxism, it is not unreasonable to assume that he incorrectly used the term before he fully understood how contradictory it was and has only recently trotted out this defense after much criticism. After all, if he seeks to critique the ideology of Postmodern Neo-Marxists, why didn't he simply point out that such an ideology is contradictory to begin with?

**Conclusion**

Overall the reason why many philosophical communities hold Peterson in low regard is because he holds an astounding lack of knowledge on subjects he often talks about. He is far from being any sort of authority on many philosophical topics, yet he often presents himself as such. For that, he is shunned."
436,AskPhilosophy,"Does Jordan Peterson ever outline specific criticisms of specific radical theorists (Foucault, Adorno, Derrida etc.)?","From what I've seen, no. He doesn't know what he's talking about. That said, life's too short to spend it sifting through Peterson's massive online oeuvre.

He *does* talk about Heidegger a bit, but he makes a hash of it (such as getting hung up on the capital ""B"" in Heidegger's ""Being,"" as though he has no understanding that alll nouns are capitalized in German.)

439,AskPhilosophy,Is an Anarchistic society effectively just going to be dominated by the will of the strong?,"Other people, presumably. Anarchist politics is *actively* centrifugal: it aims to dispel all concentration of power (in the hands of a few) and place it firmly among the people, understood collectively and communally. Those who would attempt to seize power would, then, have to 'seize' it from literally everyone else. Further, insofar as this dispersal of power is what guarantees the maximal freedom of all, its not very likely that everyone else will accede to any such concentration of power in the hands of a few. The power-hungry ought to find it the hardest to seize power, and not at all the easiest - precisely because anarchist politics is actively [organized](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/errico-malatesta-anarchism-and-organization) to disseminate power. It would be to push in one direction as everyone else is pushing in the other."
440,AskPhilosophy,Could the universe only exist because I do?,"> That I was born; with the universe, and that I will die with it and not before.

To get this up and running you'll need what is colloquially called ""Last Thursdayism"", the hypothesis that all of existence started last Thursday.  The notion is handled quite efficiently by Bertrand Russell [in The Analysis of Mind](http://dhspriory.org/kenny/PhilTexts/Russell/analysis-mind.pdf)

> In investigating memory-beliefs, there are certain points which must be borne in mind. In the first place, everything constituting a memory-belief is happening now, not in that past time to which the belief is said to refer. It is not logically necessary to the existence of a memory-belief that the event remembered should have occurred, or even that the past should have existed at all. **There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that “remembered” a wholly unreal past.** There is no logically necessary connection between events at different times; therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen in the future can
disprove the hypothesis that the world began five minutes
ago.

All of reality could have started last Thursday.  Reality popped into existence with the Grand Canyon already being so many feet deep, people created with memories of birthdays and heartbreak and friendships.  Everything just started last Thursday in a manner that leads us to believe this has all been going along for a few million years.

Why shouldn't we believe this?

> I am not suggesting that the non-existence of the past should 
be entertained as a serious hypothesis. Like all sceptical hypotheses, it is logically tenable, but uninteresting.

The hypothesis is not falsifiable.  It is not even really all that relevant, in a practical average every day sense.  Last Thursdayism is a quirky little story we can tell.  It cannot be disputed, and it is not very instructive in how to live our lives."
441,AskPhilosophy,Is logic a discovery or a human invention?,"Although mainly a philosophy of mathematics discussion, you should check out Brouwer's [intuitionism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism/) and the surrounding discussion, for it regards a similar question.

In a nutshell, Brouwer's stance is that mathematics is all in the mind. He claims that the experience of time gives rise to the first number intuitions in the mind, upon which all of mathematics is constructed. Intuitionists oppose the classical Platonic realist view of mathematics, according to which abstract mathematical objects exist independent of human activity and mathematical truths are discovered, to say that mathematics are a human construction. Kronecker -who actually predates Brouwer- once said ""God made the natural numbers; all else is the work of man"", this quote is sometimes used to summarize the intuitionist stance.

Together with mathematics there's also intuitionistic logic, whose main difference with classical logic is the rejection of the principle of excluded middle and equivalent rules. Intuitionistically speaking, for something to be true it's not enough that it is not false."
442,AskPhilosophy,Are there any philosopher that talked about fashion? Or that were interested in it?,"> External labor, labor in which man alienates himself, is a labor of self-sacrifice, of mortification. [...] As a result, therefore, man (the worker) only feels himself freely active in his animal functions – eating, drinking, procreating, or at most in his dwelling and in dressing-up, etc.; and in his human functions he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal. What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal.

Karl Marx, Estranged Labor

> By the same token, however, he becomes—through the abstractness of labor—more mechanical, duller, spiritless. The spiritual element, this fulfilled self-conscious life, be- comes an empty doing [leeres Thun). The power'of the Self consists in a rich [all-embracing] comprehension; this power is lost. He can leave some work to the machine, but his own activity thereby becomes more formalized. His dull work con- stricts him to a single point, and his work becomes more consummate the more one-sided it becomes. Yet this multiplicity creates fashion, mutability, freedom in the use of forms. 

> These things—the cut of clothing, style of furniture—are not permanent. Their change is essential and rational, far more rational than staying with one fashion and wanting to assert something as fixed in such individual forms. The beautiful is subject to no fashion,- but here there is no free beauty, only a charming beauty (eine reitzende Schon- heit)* which is the adornment of another person and relates itself to [yet] another, a beauty aimed at arousing drive, desire, and which thus has a contingency to it.

G.W.F. Hegel, Jena Lectures on the Philosophy of Spirit (1805-1807)

> As fear and resistance dwindle, as the social bases of the family change, sexuality in the form of love becomes less and less able to structure the entire life in all its detail toward one end, the tie with a single other person. The bond thus created loosens; the past is no longer carried as fully into a future, and the future becomes more nuanced as a result. A motive for sublimation, an element of civilization, falls by the way- side. The increasing likeness and changing functions of dress among the sexes are an outward sign. They symbolize the liquidation of the sexual taboo itself. The backward nations, the bushmen of Africa who are about to repeat this process at greater speed, dress up; the whites undress. They are moving toward a kind of monogamy which proba- bly differs from promiscuity by its greater convenience under prevail- ing conditions, not because it is a more intense experience. It will be easy to make it an element in the controlled traffic in which the Chinese are being trained in our time. The only difference is that it is a beginning there, a regressive phenomenon here. What seems a circle when viewed in isolation and from this continent may be a moment in a development. The European Enlightenment might be fulfilling a historical function which is no longer visible from Europe where we seem to have come full circle.

Max Horkheimer, Dawn and Decline

> The human being has a natural tendency to compare his behavior to that of a more important person (the child with adults, the lower ranking person with those of higher rank) in order to imitate the other person's ways. A law of this imitation, which aims at not appearing lower than others, especially in cases where no regard to utility is paid, is called fashion. Fashion therefore belongs under the title of vanity, because there is no inner worth in its intention; and also oifoolishness, because in fashion there is still a compulsion to let ourselves be led slavishly by the mere example that many in society give us. To be in fashion is a matter of taste; he who clings to a past custom that is out of fashion is called old- fashioned; and he who even places a worth on being out of fashion is an eccentric. But it is always better, nevertheless, to be a fool in fashion than a fool out of fashion, if we want to impose such a harsh name on this vanity at all; a title that, indeed, the mania for fashion really deserves if it sacrifices true utility or even duties to this vanity. - All fashions, by their very concept, are mutable ways of living.' For when the game of imitation is fixed, it becomes custom, and then taste is no longer considered at all. Accordingly, it is novelty that makes fashion popular, and to be inventive in all sorts of external forms, even if they often degenerate into something fantastic and somewhat hideous, belongs to the style of courtiers, especially ladies. Others then anxiously imitate these forms, and those in low social positions"" burden themselves with them long after the courtiers have put them away. - So fashion is not, strictly speaking, a matter of taste (for it can be quite contrary to taste), but of mere vanity in giving oneself airs/' and of rivalry in outdoing one another by it. (The élégants de la cour, otherwise called petits maîtres, are windbags.) 

> Splendor can be joined with true, ideal taste, which is therefore some- thing sublime that is at the same time beautiful (such as a splendid starry heaven, or, if it does not sound too vulgar, a St. Peter's church in Rome). Even pomp, an ostentatious display for show, can also be joined with taste, but not without firm objection by taste; because pomp is calculated for the masses, which include a great deal of rabble, whose taste, being dull, calls more for sensation than the capacity for judging.

Immanuel Kant, Anthropology form a Practical Point of View

> Origin and Utility of Fashion.—The obvious satisfaction of the individual with his own form excites imitation and gradually creates the form of the many—that is, fashion. The many desire, and indeed attain, that same comforting satisfaction with their own form. Consider how many reasons every man has for anxiety and shy self-concealment, and how, on this account, three-fourths of his energy and goodwill is crippled and may become unproductive! So we must be very grateful to fashion for unfettering that three-fourths and communicating self-confidence and the power of cheerful compromise to those who feel themselves bound to each other by its law. Even foolish laws give freedom and calm of the spirit, so long as many persons have submitted to their sway.

Friedrich Nietzsche, Human, All-Too-Human

> The fact that fashion expresses and at the same time emphasizes the tendency towards equalization and individualization, and the desire for imitation and conspicuousness, perhaps explains why it is that women, broadly speaking, are its staunchest ad- herents. Scientific discretion should caution us against forming judgments about woman ""in the plural."" At the same time it may be said of woman in a general way, whether the statement be justified in every case or not, that her psychological characteristic in so far as it differs from that of man, consists in a lack of differentiation, in a greater simi- larity among the different members of her sex, in a stricter adherence to the social aver- age. Whether on the final heights of modern culture, the facts of which have not yet fur- nished a contribution to the formation of this general conviction, there will be a change in the relation between men and women, a change that may result in a com- plete reversal of the above distinction, I do not care to discuss, inasmuch as we are con- cerned here with more comprehensive his- torical averages. The relation and the weak- ness of her social position, to which woman has been doomed during the far greater por- tion of history, however, explains her strict regard for custom, for the generally accepted and approved forms of life, for all that is proper. A weak person steers clear of indi- vidualization; he avoids dependence upon self with its responsibilities and the neces- sity of defending himself unaided. He finds protection only in the typical form of life, which prevents the strong from exercising his exceptional powers. But resting on the firm foundation of custom, of what is gen- erally accepted, woman strives anxiously for all the relative individualization and per- sonal conspicuousness that remains.

443,AskPhilosophy,"Am I obligated to consider, engage with, or ""not avoid,"" any ideas or viewpoints that oppose mine even if they bring me stress or discomfort?","It's wise you know what the argument is, but there's no reason you should be obliged to respond or engage with the same content every time you see it. You need to balance out your exposure to get many angles of the same topic so that you can have a broader perspective.

It's tricky though, because sometimes there are nuances in certain arguments or new ideas that come out of probing a person. Sometimes the best approach is to just ask questions without prescribing any superiority or inferiority to ideas. Usually bad logic and poorly defended ideas will fall apart on their own without the direct contrast and if they don't you're in a good position to understand something about it.

No one wants to see toxic ideas float around, but they will float around regardless of if you see it there or not. Without people taking necessary steps to be bulwarks for what they consider to be good values there is no debate, there is no conversation. You are morally obliged to be a bulwark in the same way someone is morally obliged to pick up garbage other people litter.

There are ways though that you can do the job without it sapping your soul, and I think one of those is getting a larger perspective so you can actually find common ground and make actual progress rather than, as you say, add noise to an unchanging conversation."

445,AskPhilosophy,What are some common pitfalls when studying philosophy alone?,"Arrogance.

Philosophy demands great discipline for sufficient clarity, and many self-taught students cannot meet these levels of dedication, source-checking and careful reading on their own. Then, they mistake the *possibility of original interpretation* for the certitude that anything they said after having read (sometimes half of) a work, as a legitimate opinion. 

If academia is plagued with people who can't think for themselves, amateurdom is laced with folks who cannot recognize their lack of understanding. Then, suddendly, they are part of the enlightened few that are holding onto ""truths"" amidst a society of sheep. And they back up their ridiculously contrived perspectives with lazy readings, or ""refutations"", of notable authors.

What I'm saying is; no, just because Kant or Hegel or Plato said something, doesn't mean it's true. But, before you believe you thought of something they haven't, managed to refute their answers and found the key to these longstanding problems, refrain. Be patient. 

When philosophy seems easy, you're most likely not a genius, just wrong."
446,AskPhilosophy,"What philosophical theory, concept, or argument ought to be more widely known?","The Hegelian Dialectic. Yes, people have heard of it, but most people know a bastardised version. Whether or not one agrees with Hegel, I think that one should at least understand his philosophy before condemning it. 

A very common misreading of the Hegelian dialectic can be abbreviated into the infamous schema, ‘Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis’. This schema, however, cannot be found in the work of Hegel except for in a single line that reproaches Kant for having ""everywhere posited thesis, antithesis, synthesis.""  Hegel stresses that the “triadic form” becomes something lifeless, a mere shadow, when reduced to a formalised schema.  

Two mistakes follow from such a misreading of Hegel. The first is the idea that Hegel had a strict *a priori* method that he laid upon the world in order to extract knowledge. Hegel is clear that thinking must make every effort to approach the object as it is. Thinking must reach out to the object by trying to shed any pre-given concepts, such as Object, Cause, Universal, etc. Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis are such concepts. 

The second mistake assumes that dialectical thinking brings together two opposing elements that stand externally to one another in an attempt to create one single entity. This mistake understands the dialectic as a kind of mediator in a dispute. A proposition is brought forward, and an opposing proposition is held against it. A calculation is then made that intends to preserve the characteristics that are shared by both propositions in an attempt solve the tension.  The Synthesis would be a kind of compromise between two feuding parties. 

In his demonstration of the dialectic at the beginning of *Logic*, Hegel clearly shows how such a reading is mistaken. Being is not held up as a complete, self-contained entity against its already existing opposite, Nothingness. An examination of the notion of Being, an exploration of Being *on its own terms*, reveals that “pure being and pure nothing are (…) the same.”  To put it another way, the chasm that separates Being from Nothingness, that marks each entity as external to one another, is dissolved.
	
The immanence of this procedure is of great importance in the dialectic. If we recall Hegel’s demand that thinking must try to reach beyond predefined concepts towards the object itself we can get a picture of how the dialectic operates. If one were to declare that ‘X is a human being’, we have what appears to be a straightforward claim. In logical terms, we are dealing with the formula ‘A=B’. 

But a problem immediately emerges once we realise that ‘A’ is not equal to ‘B’. ‘B’ is a universal category. At the same time, there is something about ‘A’, something that renders it to be a particular rather than a universal, which cannot be attributed to ‘B’. ‘A’ is simultaneously more and less than ‘B’. The shorthand ‘A=B’ is an equation that treats all the characteristics that differentiate ‘A’ from ‘B’ as identical. There is a zero-sum game that ignores difference for the sake of pragmatism and elegance.  

If we return to the proposition ‘X is a human being’, any individual that we might think of will possess characteristics that do not fit into the concept ‘human being’. One might respond by subsuming the characteristics of this individual into the concept ‘human being’ so that what used to render the individual different from the concept ‘human being’, is now a part of that concept. This subsumption, however, would force the concept ‘human being’ to include everything that this particular individual is not, that is, the characteristics of other individuals that they do not share. 

And so, the individual would not do justice to the emphatic concept ‘human being’ and would once again become a mere particular of a universal concept. There is a movement, or contradiction, immanent to the concept ‘human being’, a contradiction that says simultaneously that ‘X is a human being’ and that ‘there are no human beings’.

Another thing to note is the way that the distance between thought and the world is mediated through thought itself.  Thinking must reach beyond pre-given categories, must reach beyond thought to that which is not thought. This paradox, this impossibility, is what drives the dialectic."
447,AskPhilosophy,What is Camus's Argument Against Suicide?,"I've been mulling over this a lot recently, here's where I've ended up:

First, we need to take a step back and appreciate the context of Sisyphus and the boulder. He's made to do this repetitive, impossible-to-achieve task as a punishment for his trickery in life. The aspect that's punishment is, of course, the fact that he'll never actually make it all the way to the top of the mountain--he will always be frustrated, and success (and rest) will always be ever beyond his grasp.

But that means that the punishment is only a state of mind--pushing the boulder up the mountain stops feeling like a punishment (read: frustrates the punishment's purpose) once Sisyphus makes peace with the fact that he will never make it up the mountain. Even more radically, imagine Sisyphus not only making peace with this task, but actively enjoying it--then it's not punishment at all, he's just a happy man constrained by forces beyond his control.


And I think that cuts to the heart of your inquiry: why not suicide? Perhaps the better question is: why kill yourself? It's giving into the ""punishment"" that is life, and a ""punishment"" that can be frustrated by flipping the bird at the universe and enjoying life instead, despite those forces beyond our control that drive us to despair.


If this sounds a little tenuous, now you understand why this is called absurdism--after all, making an appeal for people to enjoy punishment is a rather absurd ask (and a rather French one at that *cough* Marquise de Sade *cough*). But if we can imagine Sisyphus happy despite his certain knowledge of the eternity of frustration that awaits him, then we can imagine ourselves making peace with, and even enjoying dealing with, our own (mortal, finite) demons, thus freeing ourselves of the angst and torment driving us to suicide. 


At least, that's my 2¢. I'm really interested and excited to see what other responses this question generates!"
448,AskPhilosophy,Is truth preferable over suffering?,"This is a hard but interesting question, I think, because it involves comparing values. Some thinkers, like (hedonic) utilitarians, are value monists. Let's imagine some hedonic utilitarian who says that happiness or pleasure is the only value and pain or suffering is the only thing of disvalue. This person can judge what's good or bad based on how much happiness or pleasure it brings and how much suffering it helps us prevent. They would clearly prefer the Matrix, unless being stuck in the Matrix brought more unhappiness in the long run.

Most of us, however, seem to think that there are different kinds of values. Truth, we might think, has a value that is distinct from the value of happiness. Some thinkers, like Ruth Chang, think that it's impossible to compare values of these different types. We more or less have to make an 'existential choice' between them when they come into conflict. People like William MacAskill, by contrast, think that comparing values is possible, and is indeed something we do everyday. Others might say that happiness and truth do actually share some common value, one that is fairly abstract and general, and that you're really asking which of these things have more of that value.

450,AskPhilosophy,What are the actual ideas that comprise fascism?,"According to Umberto Eco, there are 14 major defining features of fascism, and the more of them you have, the more fascist-y you are.

1. **A cult of tradition,** often appealing to and combining “ancient truths,” generally mystical, from various incompatible sources (e.g. Augustine, Stonehenge, Atlantis, etc.).

2. **A rejection of modernism,** blaming the rationalistic and democratic spirit of the Enlightenment as destroying human spirit and making us depraved and weak, instead embracing “irrationalism.”

3. **A cult of action,** praising action for its own sake without critical reflection and anti-intellectual.

4. **Viewing disagreement as treason,** devaluing discourse out of fear that critical analysis will expose its syncretistic faith.

5. **A fear of difference,** exploiting racist and xenophobic tendencies.

6. **Appealing to the middle class,** emphasizing national identity to unite this group, and frightening them threats from the ""elites"" humiliating them and the poor overthrowing them.

7. **Obsessed with plots,** hyping up the enemy threat, both within and without, often combined with xenophobia (e.g. Jews).

8. **Casting enemies as both weak and powerful.** The enemy elites are powerful enough to wrong and humiliate you, but feeble enough that the fascist can conquer them easily.

9. **Viewing life as permanent warfare.** Pacifism is siding with the enemy. This is a problem for the fascist, who wants to simultaneously claim that life is never-ending war, and that their party will ""win"" that war.

10. **A contempt for the weak,** played up in a popular elitism and hierarchy, where every member is superior to outsiders by virtue of being on the “inside.”

11. **A death cult of heroism,** turning the hero from exceptional to ordinary, and making violent death something to be craved. Impatient for death, they quickly send others to their death.

12. **Machismo,** pushing the taste for warfare into the sexual sphere through sexism and intolerance of sexual deviation, paired with phallic weaponry.

13. **Selectively populist,** claiming to represent “the People” as a common unified will, of which the Leader is the interpreter since there is no such single will, and delegitimizing their rivals as not representing the “true Voice of the People.” Fascism undermines democratic institutions as illegitimate.

14. **Newspeak,** promoting a highly simplified and impoverished vocabulary, limiting criticism.

I will also second Robert Paxton's definition given here:

>>[A] form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.

In answer to your question of fascists approach to industry and socialism, fascists want to ""return to and strengthen the old order,"" which means reinforcing existing power structures which they adopt into themselves. Fascists don't really want to nationalize industries *per se* then, but just keep it out of ""their"" hands, for however they decide to define the ""them."" This usually means allying themselves with conservatives, who also want to maintain the old order, but don't want to ""rock the boat"" as much as fascists do, or take things to the same extreme of mythologizing their past and demonizing foreigners.

Socialists and communists are enemies then because these are the people most wanting to do away with the current hierarchy, to democratize power and spread it out as far as possible, especially allying themselves with the poor against the existing order. The fascist believes that the idea of ""no hierarchy"" is a lie that the ""other"" is spreading, often specifically Jews. The hierarchy is eternal, and any talk of equality is a lie so that ""they"" can get and keep ""their"" members on top. Liberals, to the extent that they support equal rights, democratic checks on power, and welfare to support the poor are seen as an effeminate gateway to socialism and degeneracy."
451,AskPhilosophy,Is there a philosophical term for holding symbols higher than the ideas those symbols represent?,"In semiotics, there's a concept of the 'floating signifier,' which is a kind of signifier that lacks a strict signified, so can refer to any number of different things by different people and/or nothing at all. 

I think that's what you might be looking for."
452,AskPhilosophy,Is trusting what the scientific community has to say about a topic without fully understanding it count as the appeal to authority fallacy?,"Some philosophers of science see trust in the claims of people who have power of knowledge beyond ours as just a necessary part of having science as a useful thing. As such, the question of who is worthy of trust is a totally legitimate question when trying to figure out what is true in the world.

This is the view of one of the more interesting papers on trust in science that I have read is which is [this one.](http://biophilosophy.ca/Teaching/2070papers/whyte-trust-science.pdf) It basically sees trust in science as something that has to be worked out between scientists and society, and engages in a project to examine the conditions that have to be present for that trust, and what happens when they fail. I should note with that paper that they claim at one point that it is not only the case that communities have to trust scientists, scientists also have to be able to trust communities to a certain degree and in certain cases in order to be useful. In fact, times where scientists do not trust society lead to conditions where society cannot trust science.

As you have noted, trust in science is not only something that has to exist between the scientific community and laymen in order for science to be useful, it also has to exist between scientists and each other. This is why plagiarism and fraud are such a big deal in science. If you are ever caught faking a result, fudging things, your career is over because other scientists can no longer trust you. Part of the point of peer review is that a community of scientists working in a particular field are holding each other accountable when it comes to their trustworthiness."
453,AskPhilosophy,"Bob is a vegetarian because he wishes to reduce the suffering of animals, Jim is a vegan because he hopes to achieve health benefits through the diet: who is the more moral agent?","Various moral theories have various views.

456,AskPhilosophy,Am I morally responsible if someone commits suicide because of my action or inaction?,"There's not really a simple yes/no answer to a question like this.

Are you *ultimately responsible*? Well, no, assuming you're a moral realist, you probably believe that people are ultimately responsible for their own actions. Do you bear *some responsibility*? Probably, in that if someone tells you ""I'm going to commit suicide"" you should probably do *something* about that fact, regardless of any conditionals attached to that statement."
457,AskPhilosophy,Why did Kant write the way he did?,"Here's a bit taken from the Introduction to the Cambrdige Edition of the *Critique of Pure Reason*:

>  The book is complex, however, not just because of the complexity of Kant's own position, but also because he argues on several fronts against several different alternative positions represented in early modern philosophy generally and within the German Enlightenment in particular. In order to make room for his own dualistic defense of both modern science and human autonomy, Kant, like Descartes, Locke, and Hume, felt he had to rein in the pretensions of traditional metaphysics, which was represented for him by the school of Christian Wolff (1679-1754) and his followers, especially Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714-1762). Their position, which Kant called ""dogmatism,"" was compared in the Preface to the Critique to the despotic ministry of an absolute monarchy - Kant held dogmatism to be capricious, opinionated, faction ridden and consequently unstable and open to the contempt of rational observers.

Kant wrote the way that he did due the nature and scope of the task that he set out to accomplish, which was, in no small words, revolutionary in philosophy at the time - challenging many of the fundamental assumptions of how philosophy was done up till then."
458,AskPhilosophy,The ethics of wasting someone’s time?,"I haven't heard of anyone writing directly on this question, but it seems like a great one. I think there's an interesting question you have to begin with about what it is to ""waste someone's time"" though. As [a classic example](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html), an airport where bags took 8 minutes to get from the plane to the carousel got lots of complaints from passengers, and resolved very few of them when they cut the bag travel time to 6 minutes, but resolved everything when they moved the arrival gate to one that was an 8 minute walk from the carousel. Similarly, you find [more complaints about travel time](https://ggwash.org/view/39142/hey-look-that-flawed-texas-am-traffic-study-is-back-and-grabbing-the-usual-headlines) in a city where people drive 20 minutes with a 10 minute traffic delay than in a city where people drive 30 minutes with no traffic delay. Both of these are cases where people irrationally prefer the longer time and thus feel like their time is ""wasted"" even when things improve. 

But there are also plenty of cases where a delay at one point actually saves time over all, whether it's because  [waiting for a transfer speeds up the total trip](https://humantransit.org/2009/04/why-transferring-is-good-for-you-and-good-for-your-city.html) or a [metered onramp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramp_meter) means that a short wait now speeds up travel times for everyone on the highway.

I think counterintuitive things like congestion pricing can do a lot, but you need to do a lot of detailed empirical and theoretical work about the particular systems in question, rather than trying to write something totally general about the ethics of wasting someone's time."
459,AskPhilosophy,What are some lesser known philosophical paradoxes?,"It is fairly well known within academia, but is a bit harder to grasp and deal with so I find that it is not as well known for people outside of academia. I only found out about it in depth later in uni:

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-causal/#NewcProb

The paradox is a hypothetical situation in which you have to choose between two options and, no matter which choice you make, you violate a fundamental principle of reasoning."
460,AskPhilosophy,Are there any philosophers who talk exclusively about anti-intellectualism?,"Anti-intellectualism is a big topic and concern under two umbrellas; social and philosophical. I'm going to try to at least put some philosophy in here so the post doesn't get removed, since this is kind of a social issue more than it is a philosophical subject.

As a philosophical issue, it falls under epistemology and ethics. For a classic, I recommend Nichomachean Ethics by Aristotle, who covers the Intellectual Virtues and that intersection of ethics and epistemology

Examples of the topic

1. What is my responsibility as far as what I know and what I don't? (The topic of Justification; justified true belief or warranted true belief)
2. What do I have to know to be responsible? (more under ethics but still important)
3. What can I know? (All epistemology)
4. Do I really know? (Also broadly epistemology)

But I imagine you're thinking about the second umbrella, which isn't philosophy, but is more a social issue philosophers are involved in.

As a social issue it's been a problem with philosophy for all the history of philosophy. Philosophers have win society's trust of ""the educated"" to be taken seriously. All the way back to Greek Sophists, who were accused of arguing just for the sake of sounding smart and social status. Isocrates' against the sophist was an attempt to undo this concern with these ""intellectuals"". A little more modern, Descartes tried to take a careful balance to address the French Church's distrust of science, and explain the lack of conflict between science and religion (in that day's understanding of science).

Pretty much in every time period, anti-intellectualism has been a problem to different degrees and philosophers as academics, have to struggle against it to varying degrees.

I'm going to provide a reading list for modern, United States anti-intellectualism. The subject is social, so these are not necessarily philosophers. So just warning you, these books are not ""philosophy"". These are people attempting to tackle to the social issue or comment on it. Some of these authors happen to be religious because specifically, Christianity has been a source of it in the United States and Christians have made attempts to undo it, so those last three are more ""religious"" authors touching on the issue. They aren't supporting anti-intellectualism, they are trying to undo the damage.

Alexis De Tocqueville, Democracy in America  
Richard Hofstadter, Anti-Intellectualism in American Life  
Mark Noll, The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind  
Francis Schaeffer, Escape from Reason

I'm including a bonus book, which is not US specific, but I'm including it because it is philosophy. It is not common for a philosopher to argue the side of anti-intellectualism. Most philosophers are ""pro-intellectual"". This would be an author trying to argue for anti-intellectualism, which is a source material for fascism. Anti-intellectualism is a core piece of modern fascism, so consider this a source material of a philosopher trying to encourage anti-intellectualism.

461,AskPhilosophy,What is a Hegelian dialectic?,"Hegelian dialectic is a process. Its starting point is an idea (or a state) which undergoes what Hegel calls 'determinate negation' and then becomes something else. I'll take an example, I won't be very faithful to Hegel's vocabulary but it will be easier to understand: In the Phenomenology of spirit, Hegel analyses dialectically the unfolding of certain claims to absolute knowledge. For instance, we could claim that absolute knowledge comes with the knowledge of the particular (sense certainty). Hegel takes this claim to absolute knowledge and shows that this idea is in itself contradictory. Because knowing a particular thing implies the knowledge of the general. For example, if you say 'this tree here and now' and then you say 'this house here and now', you use the words 'here' and 'now' to describe to very different objects. Each time you point to the particular, you assume that there is such a thing as a 'here' and a 'now' which are general. Because space and time are not merely objects, they're general conditions that render the existence of the particular possible. So inside the idea of the particular, there is its negation, the general. But this negation is not just pure self-contradiction, it's also productive (hence 'determinate' negation). It's productive because it brings about a new idea, the idea of the general. Which also undergoes a dialectical process.

As for your second question, dialectic is a way to analyse ideas or historical processes. It's not really an argument per se, it's a way to describe and understand reality. The question that remains is whether it's a good way to do that. 

I hope this helps. Hegelian dialectic is very hard to understand because it is quite abstract and there is no easy example to explain it. Beware of simple explanations of Hegel (for example the idea of thesis-antithesis-synthesis which is not what Hegel is actually doing), they're generally not useful.

If you want a book that explains Hegel's major work, I recommend Peter Kalkavage's Logic of Desire. It's very clear and quite faithful to the text.

Edit: /u/tameonta adds some very important clarifications and useful information that I forgot to mention."
462,AskPhilosophy,What does this Nietzche quote mean?,It is saying that just because someone can’t save themselves does not necessarily mean that they can’t save others. The means of saving may be different and what it takes to save others may be completely different and perhaps even less than what it takes to save oneself.
463,AskPhilosophy,"Philosophy, suicide, and mental health- what perspectives are there?","Albert Camus' *The Myth of Sisyphus* might be the best place to begin, as Camus is concerned directly with the question of suicide, judging it to be the one truly serious philosophical problem.

I should also draw your attention to [this website](https://ethicsofsuicide.lib.utah.edu/)."
464,AskPhilosophy,"What does Slavoj Žižek mean when he says ""The only way to be an atheist is through Christianity.""?","While u/listdervernunft has it more literally correct, I think a better understanding of zizeks point comes from Lacan. A proper Lacanian analyst should NEVER be a life coach (or other supposed to know). In fact, the ultimate goal of Lacanian psychoanalysis is to get the patient (analysand) to understand that such a life coach couldnt even exist. Lacan sees the formation of the subject as a short circuited dialectic in which its very being is just a constant search for ultimate happiness, satisfaction, or jouissance. It tries to find this happiness by assuming the Other knows how to find it. However, when one comes close to obtaining what it thinks will provide ultimate happiness, it recognizes that the object won't make it happy and short circuits, panics, and spirals into some other life goal. The analysts job is to make the patient realize and accept this dialectic so as to enjoy life. If a Lacanian analyst acts as a life coach, he or she merely perpetuates this cycle of belief.

So zizek is praising Christianity (or rather his reading of it, not, say, a televangelists) for very explicitly and publicly killing off the one entity who could objectively tell a person what to do and give meaning.

EDIT: I'm gonna continue into zizek here to hopefully make my point more clear. To better understand zizek's claim, think of the angsty teen who's just read their first Nietzsche. They walk around scoffing about the death of God and how silly and obsessed all the Christians are around them. However, have they really let go of God? Become without God as an a-theist if the majority of their actual existence is still spent speculating on the cosmic being? The only way to let go of God is to truly stop giving a shit about defying Him/Her. 

So zizek is ultimately telling this story in relation to his understanding of politics and ideology. Even if you're protesting the current state of things, you're enjoying (libidinally invested in) it. Ex: ""I'm with her,"" ""lock her up,"" ""cheeto-benito amirite?""). This kind of finding an identity in our ideology means we secretly don't want our enemy to go away. Because then what the fuck would we do? Where would we find our purpose? Think what the joker tells batman when he's hangint upside down in The Dark Knight. 

Thus, It's better to strive towards the kierkegaardian knight of faith rather than dream of being the tragic hero (not to confuse our existentialists here haha) In other words, shut up about it and actually figure out how to make significant change."
465,AskPhilosophy,"Foucault: ""I don't say the things I say because they are what I think, I say them as a way to make sure they no longer are what I think"" — Interpretations?","""I don't say the things because I think them, I say the things so as to no longer think them.""

The translation sucks."
466,AskPhilosophy,When and why did Greeks stop being influential in philosophy?,"The Roman Empire happened. Greece became a providence of the Roman Empire and Athens declined as the intellectual center of thought, whereas Alexandria in Egypt and Rome grew. By this time, the most influential philosophers of the schools of philosophy that were originally Greek, such as neopythagoreanism and neoplatonism, were from various parts of the Roman Empire. Galen, for example of intellectuals at this time, though a Greek born in Pergamon (modern-day Turkey), did most of his work in Rome."
467,AskPhilosophy,Is it Moral Having a dog as a pet?,"Take a look at Peter Singer’s work for ethics and morality concerning human interaction with animals.

I personally agree with you in that the current culture around “owning” pets is morally questionable and should be discussed more often. It’s very obvious to me that breeding is cruel and unusual — humans have indeed customized a species to suite our aesthetic tastes, and have rendered dogs and cats alike completely useless outside of our pleasure (i.e. squish-faced dogs, often sought out in bulldogs, have breathing difficulties specifically because of their build that was designed through breeding; royalty-breeds such as shitzus are designed to sit and do nothing all day, so as to keep its owner company; both of these traits would kill these breeds out of the gene pool instantly should they be left to care for themselves). 
Because “quality of life” is subjective, the argument that domesticated pets and animals in captivity live longer is weak. To put into perspective: would a human rather live in a small room, where exercise is dependent on their captor’s preference and convenience, eating hard kibbles that scientifically may or may not have just enough nutrients to sustain life? Though I don’t have data, my guess would be that many would find these conditions morally objectionable."
468,AskPhilosophy,Why aren't Alan Turing's (non-logic-based) philosophy contributions not often remembered outside Computer Science and AI research?,"That essay is one of the most famous works of philosophy. So, your question contains a false presupposition. Turing's works *are* remembered outside compsci and AI."
469,AskPhilosophy,Can we have casual sex without using people as mere means?,"One important thing to remember is that, from a Kantian perspective, the problem isn't treating people as a means, it's treating them as a **mere** means.

Taking a cab uses the cab driver as a means to get to a destination, but, so long as we treat the cab driver as fully realized person with all their own needs and desires, we are not treating them as a mere means.

Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I suspect that Kant held the, unfortunately common for his time, view of sex as something a man does to a woman for his own gratification, and nothing more."
470,AskPhilosophy,Is there a particular reason why ancient Eastern (e.g. Taoism & Buddhism) and Western (e.g. Stoicism & Epicureanism) schools seem to start at such different points but converge in so many of their conclusions?,"I've noticed this too. Buddhism and Stoicism have an almost creepy amount in common.  Another strange similarity is between Marxist and Buddhist dialectics. Marx and Engels both comment on this, and the similarity between Buddhism and the philosophy of Heraclitus but they don't seem to make much of it.

&#x200B;

It's hard to see how there could be either internal or external reasons for this. Internally, all of these traditions start with very different premises, building on very different intellectual heritage. Externally, they originate under very different material and political conditions. Perhaps there are just certain ideas that are just bound to come up in a sufficiently developed philosophical tradition. If you got enough people together in a room to talk about stuff for long enough, maybe a decent portion of them would inevitably hit on some of these ideas, regardless of background.

&#x200B;

I do also wonder if there's an element of confirmation bias. When I, as a westerner with a background in western philosophy, encounter Buddhism the elements it has in common with schools of thought that I'm more familiar with stand out and seem more important. It's possible that we downplay the less consistent elements without realising. There doesn't seem to be a western counterpart for rebirth which is of central importance in Buddhism, for example."
471,AskPhilosophy,"If a robot is programmed to kill, is the Robot Evil, or is the Programmer Evil?","> Human beings are essentially blood machines

That's a hard determinist assumption. It generally follows from that, unless you make some kind of compatibilist defense of freedom, that human beings are not morally responsible for anything they do.

However, many philosophers disagree with that, either by asserting the freedom of human will (and that we are *more* than blood machines; not necessarily beings with souls, but altogether different from automata), or by denying that its inexistence implies this moral vacuum. You should read up on metaphysical libertarianism and compatibilism."

473,AskPhilosophy,"If a person who committed a serious crime, say murder, has lost their memories or developed dementia, are they still guilty/deserving of punishment?","I think it depends on your theory of personal identity. As far as I remember, Locke would say (or at least this would be a consequence of his theory) that, after losing its memories, a person could not be guilty of the crimes that he/she commited before the memory loss, because he/she would not in fact be the same person that commited those crimes."
474,AskPhilosophy,Why did focault think that marxism was bound to the 1800s and made no sense outside of it?,"Foucault, I think, has (at least) two issues with ""dialectical materialism."" First, it tends to see the state and state institutions as the main locus of power. Second, it tends to see power dynamics in terms of class struggle.

**Micro versus Macro Power Relations**

Foucault, basically, thinks that such analysis takes a kind of top-down approach, beginning by looking at those who visibly hold the power (the bourgeoisie, government, etc.) and interpreting all other power relations in terms of being either an Ideological State Apparatus of bourgeois power or being a leftist stronghold for fighting against such power. Although deeply inspired by Althusser here, Foucault thinks that the Marxist framework of class struggle is too narrow, and that it misses several crucial places where power relations happen.


Instead of this top-down analysis, Foucault proposes a kind of ""atomistic"" approach to power-relations. For this reason, Foucault isn't just interested in looking at how state power trickles down through institutions like the media and school, thereby assuring our allegiance to the state. Instead, Foucault *starts* by looking at power at a micro level. Instead of looking at (obvious) sources of state power, Foucault looks at the power dynamics of parents and children, prisoners and prisons, criminals and the justice system, and patients and analysts. For Foucault, we must eschew the macro-level analysis of class struggle, focusing instead on a micro-level analysis of everyday power relations.

**Inscription of Power on Bodies**

Through these micro-level institutions, Foucault thinks, power is ""inscribed on our bodies"" and we are first interpolated by the system into subjects, meaning that we tend to identify ourselves in terms of the power that dominates us, finding ourselves always already individuated in terms of such power. For example, Foucault describes how the classification of different types of ""sexual perversion"" in the 19th century creates, through the prohibition of these actions qua *specific* actions, an intensification and specification of these specific sexual pleasures. The technique of controlling human sexuality, accordingly, becomes inscribed into our own identities (inscribed, in fact, into our bodies), and forms these very sexual identities. It's controversial exactly how to interpret Foucault's views on sexuality here, but he at least *suggests* that the figure of ""the homosexual"" emerges from a scientific attempt to classify different types of ""perversions,"" and that the classification and prohibition creates both an intensification and specification of this ""type,"" thereby inscribing the classification into the body of the individual. 

This would be an example of what Foucault calls ""power knowledge,"" the idea that through the act of knowing something, one exercises power over it. This has become huge in colonial and post-colonial studies through the work of Edward Said, who suggests that part of the operation of colonial powers included an attempt to ""classify"" and ""study"" the ""Eastern mentality,"" and that this becomes a form of ""power knowledge"" that the West exercises over the East (the Eastern person can't speak, because we need a Western expert to explain ""their different cultural mentality,"" etc.)

**Foucault's History of Power**

Foucault has a kind of general power timeline, where he thinks that with the disappearance of ""sovereign power"" in the 17th century, we move into a period that he calls ""disciplinary power."" In previous times, for example, a sovereign would demand a certain tax revenue from a village, and the village as a whole would be responsible for paying their taxes to the tax collector, putting this together themselves as a community, and the tax collector for bringing in so much revenue, and so on. When someone was punished, sovereigns didn't really care about catching every criminal or even if the person actually committed the wrong. Instead, they just wanted to publicly torture someone as a deterrent every so often, letting most criminals get away. In the shift to disciplinary power, public records become super important. Now, individuals have *records* and are individually responsible for their own personal taxes. They have ""permanent records"" in school. They have criminal records. Foucault sees this as a new kind of power, one that focuses on people as individuals. In the courtroom, rather than making a big show or public execution, the very soul of the person is put on trial, and the judge aims to get the person to confess, not only to the crime, but that they acted by their own free will, were not criminally insane, that they chose to be evil *in their soul*. Moreover, the figure of the detective begins to hunt down criminals, and the criminal emerges as the mastermind. Even the ""profiling"" of criminals (beginning in the 19th century with the invention of criminology) involves a classification of individuals into types, aiming to specify them and punish their souls, etc.

The final stage of power, Foucault thinks, is called ""biopower,"" which is where we are moving now. This involves a kind of ""population thinking,"" where the body politic is treated as a biological organism with certain ""diseased"" elements that need to be cured. For example, instead of ""the drug user,"" we talk about the ""heroin epidemic,"" a disease in the body politic that needs to be statistically reduced down. Instead of ""the serial killer"" or ""the criminal,"" we have ""gun violence,"" which requires either more investment into psychology (because ""mental health"" is an issue in the population at large) or less guns being available (thus creating a statistical decrease in gun violence), etc. Foucault's final lectures concerned this final type of power. "
475,AskPhilosophy,Why does philosophy focus so much on individual thinkers?,"This also depends on the university--for example, a number of universities will *only* look at 'theories', and the idea of doing extended exegesis of a single author rather than a survey of excerpts concerning a particular topic would be wholly foreign; whereas my university is known for being very focused on the history of philosophy, to the point that there are almost no 'topic' classes--I'd say well over 90% of the courses consist in covering an author or a certain narrow range of authors. This also tends to be symptomatic of the division between analytic and continental attitudes in philosophy.

As someone who has somewhat drunk the Kool-Aid of the history of philosophy approach, this is because sociohistorical context is *significantly* more important in philosophy than in physics. For example, in physics, it would be completely absurd for a professor to start lecturing at length about the socioeconomic conditions of 17th-century England during a lecture on Newton's physics. Within the context of the discipline of physics, none of that really matters when it comes to the scientific content of Newton's theories. However, it might be incredibly important for a philosopher like Foucault, who examined the ways in which historical context factored into the constitution of what he called 'regimes of truth', which are essentially the linguistic and social structures which determine how we form, and talk about, knowledge. 

Basically, there are many large areas of philosophy where the questions being asked are of a higher order (i.e. fit into a broader context) than those of certain other disciplines, and the history of philosophy is incredibly important when it comes to tackling those questions."
476,AskPhilosophy,"If God is perfect, how could he act at all?","Maybe someone knows the book more directly (or will just have the time to give the long answer), but the answer to your question is, I think, in Chapter 2 where Feser gives the account of Act/Potency which gives us a vocabulary for talking about God as Pure Act."
477,AskPhilosophy,"Is it possible to teach ethics to an AI? If so, will philosophers become society’s biggest assets?","Sure, there's plenty of AI ethics going on right now to determine which ethical rules AIs should follow, and conversely there's quite some work going on to implement it. Regarding weak AI (the AI we already have), this is important e.g. for self-driving cars"
478,AskPhilosophy,"If consequentialism is valid, shouldn't we have an ethical obligation to just steal money from billionaires and give it to the poor?","In some possible scenario, sure. That would be true. However, a consequentialist could also argue that the norm according to which we ought not to steal is very important, and that the negative consequences of deciding to ignore that norm are greater than the positive ones. I.e., by stealing from a billionaire, or by advocating that one steal from a billionaire, I sufficiently weaken the importance of said norm in people’s minds so as to, ultimately, cause more harm than good. 

Perhaps it’s true that if enough people steal from billionaires, other people might decide to steal from millionaires, and others from even less wealthy people. It could also be true that by normalizing stealing from wealthy people we contribute to a state of conflict in society which, as whole, causes more harm than good. In these cases, a consequentialist would certainly argue against your proposition here."
479,AskPhilosophy,"Almost embarrassed to ask, but where do the lines cross between metaphysics, ontology, epistemology and phenomenology?","I can't speak for phenomenology, but I'll try to talk about metaphysics, ontology, epistemology. Also, this is a good question and a hard one. In the least, it's certainly not something to be embarrassed by.

The way I make these delineations are sure to be disputed by some, but these are meant to be rough.

1. Metaphysics is roughly the general truths of being, or what is, or general truths about the world. This includes things like the nature of things, how things are, what sort of things exist or have been, etc. Topics included in metaphysics include God's existence, free will, material constitution, philosophy of time, etc.
2. Ontology is typically considered a sub-branch of metaphysics, focusing on being itself, in particular what sort of things exist or have reality or being. So, one's ontology might be physicalist, which would include only those things that are posited/discovered by the natural sciences in their theories/explanations.
3. Epistemology is the study of knowledge. Epistemology typically centers on the normative aspects of knowledge and beliefs. So, for instance, what are the justification conditions for knowledge, what is the difference between, if there is one, between warrant and entitlement, etc.

The lines between these are often blurred. So, for instance, one might be engaged in the philosophy of perception. This often will cover areas in the philosophy of mind (considered its own area, but is a specific-topic metaphysics) and epistemology.

My guess is that phenomenology will fall somewhere between 1 and 3.

Again, there is room for disagreement here regarding the specifics, but this is the general and rough way of characterizing these three, at least in my understanding and most of my colleagues in academic philosophy (who are mostly analytically trained)."
480,AskPhilosophy,Do I need prior knowledge in order to understand Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus?,I would say no. It is pretty straight forward. You could read some Kierkegaard or Nietzsche first but I really doubt its necessary.
481,AskPhilosophy,How does one logically argue against Nihilism?,"The argument contains a hidden premise: ""things must be permanent/eternal to matter."" That premise is quite easily rejected. It may be the case that my house will one day crumble to ruins, but it will still provide me shelter *for now*, so my house matters right now."
482,AskPhilosophy,What would a utilitarian make of the Truman show?,"This is quite similar to a common ethical thought experiment known as the Sadist's Convention. It involves spectators in an arena deriving pleasure from watching a single unwilling participant be tortured. This is presented as an objection to utilitarianism; our gut instinct is that this is morally wrong, even if the pleasure generated by a stadium of sadists is greater than the pain endured by a single unlucky person. Here are the most common responses to the thought experiment from a utilitarian standpoint, which could also apply to your example:

1. Bite the bullet! Agree that as strange as it might seem, a stadium full of sadist pleasure really does outweigh the pain of an individual, and that the Sadist's Convention isn't morally wrong.

2. Argue that the pleasure of the sadists does not actually outweigh the pain of the individual. Perhaps pain should be weighted more heavily than pleasure, or some other solution that ""fixes"" the utility math.

3. Argue that the pleasure of the sadists is incomparable to the pain of the individual. This generally involves implicating things like personal freedom, inalienable rights, dignity, etc. In utility calculations. While this is the most common response, it also typically commits one to consequentialism, rather than pure utilitarianism. Realistically speaking, this is likely how most modern consequentialist philosophers would respond; very few, if any, philosophers continue to defend pure utilitarianism."
483,AskPhilosophy,"Is Descartes' ""I think, therefore I am"" a valid argument?","Hegel argues in the Lectures on the History of Philosophy that the cogito is not a syllogistic argument but an expression of a truth that cannot be doubted from the perspective that does the doubting in question. He essentially argues that it is not *arguing* anything but simply putting into a discursive form the *immediately known truth* of the unity of being and thought. The lectures are quite accessible so if you have the time I'd suggest you read them on your own, you can find it on marxists.org."
484,AskPhilosophy,Why are human lives more valuable than animal’s lives?,"There's been some other excellent answers here, but I thought I'd add one important thought. But first, let me introduce the debate in which that thought matters.

Some philosophers (like Peter Singer) think that the capacity for sentience is the only trait a creature can have that should be of moral concern to us-- this is roughly because ethics should be general and non-discriminatory, since we wouldn't want to say some social group should have more rights than another even *if* that social group had more capacities or talents (another philosopher adds that we shouldn't mix up merit with value). So for Singer, animals count for just as much as for people.

Some other philosophers (I believe Shelly Kagan is an example) think that while sentience is important, it's not the only important thing. Things like cognitive complexity and rationality also add value. (Though it's an empirical question as to how much rationality and cognitive complexity animals have, this is not something we should make assumptions about. I studied animal consciousness for my M.A. and was amazed how complex and smart they are). But anyway, for these philosophers, there is a hierarchy where some animals matter more than others.

Now **here's the important point:**

Even if animals' lives were less valuable than human lives, this would not necessarily justify people eating animals. Imagine, as an example, that Albert Einstein's life is more valuable than mine. This *may* be true, but it does not mean that Albert Einstein therefor has a right to eat me.

The circumstances in which it might be permissible to eat an animal can vary. If I need to do it to survive, this will be an easier thing to morally justify than if I merely eat it because I prefer the taste of cow to the taste of veggie burger.

It seems like a cow would have to count for almost nothing if its life is less important than my slight preference for the taste of cow meat to the vegan 'Beyond Burger'. And while my capacities of better rationality might justify me eating the cow if I'm starving and it's between me and the cow, I don't see why my intelligence should make my preference for the taste of meat more important. (And I think Shelly Kagan would agree with this point, too).

So, in summary, even if human lives are more valuable, this doesn't mean that humans should be allowed to eat animals."
485,AskPhilosophy,"If we made a 3D simulated model of the human brain, bit by bit exactly alike and functioning just the same, would it be conscious?","The position that the simulation would be conscious is called [functionalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/functionalism/).

Functionalism is a reasonably common position in philosophy of mind; but there are lots of philosophers who hold different positions."
486,AskPhilosophy,"Is there any meaningful distinction between natural and man-made? Humans arose out of nature, so how could anything we do be considered not natural?","Just for clarification: In a Venn diagram, would ""man-made"" be completely, partially or not-at-all a subset of ""natural""?"
487,AskPhilosophy,"Do paradoxes appear because of a flaw in our way of expressing thoughts, or are they an aspect of logic itself?","I am on my phone, might expand on it later. Quine's *The Ways of Paradox* is the classic work on this topic, I highly recommend reading through it, it is not a very long paper and it is a very fun read. You can find it online.
 
edit: expanding a bit... you can find the paper here: https://math.dartmouth.edu/~matc/Readers/HowManyAngels/WaysofParadox/WaysofParadox.html
 
I would also recommend Yablo's *Is conceivability a guide to Possibility?* as additional reading.
 
The SEP has some detailed articles on a variety of notable paradoxes, in which several ways of responding to paradoxes are demonstrated. Here is their article on the liar paradox: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liar-paradox/ and here is one on the sorites paradox: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sorites-paradox/
 
Quine's tripartite distinction of veridical, falsidical, and genuine antinomy is very nicely presented in the first half of the original article. Further along in the article, the discussion of Russell's paradox and the Godel proofs might benefit from background reading. The SEP article on both should be more than enough."
488,AskPhilosophy,Why do more philosophers tend to be socialist than capitalist ?,One likely and very simple factor is the fact that [Karl Marx is arguably the most influential scholar of all time](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/karl-marx-is-the-worlds-most-influential-scholar-180947581/) according to some studies.
489,AskPhilosophy,What are the problems of Stoicism?,"I don’t whether you are asking for the problems with which stoicism concerns itself, or for criticisms of stoicism. 

Assuming the latter, Bertrand Russell criticizes stoicism in his History of Western Philosophy. For example, “If virtue is the sole good, there can be no reason against cruelty and injustice, since, as the Stoics are never tired of pointing out, cruelty and injustice afford the sufferer the best opportunities for the exercise of virtue.”

See this thread for example: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/zblu2/criticisms_of_stoicism_from_bertrand_russells/

If you just want info on stoicism generally I agree with u/laconicforms. Cicero is good for seeing stoicism in context of other Hellenistic schools. In addition to De Finibus, the Tusculan Disputations are also helpful."
490,AskPhilosophy,Should a dictatorship be preferred over a democracy if it is guranteed that it will have better outcomes?,"Mill argued in *On Liberty* that society had to reach a certain level of advancement before liberal political systems* could work for it.

Before that, Mill argued that it was permissible (possibly necessary, I can't remember exactly) for something like a dictator to help society advance to that point. 

For Mill, that would be preferable to a liberal government that would inevitably collapse under the weight of its undereducated populus.

I suspect but have not verified that this position has fallen out of favor with modern liberal philosophers. I suspect that today you're more likely to hear an argument against dictatorship based on (a) individual autonomy, (b) criticisms of the concept that individuals are ""less advanced"" in tribal societies, (c) accusations of racism (e.g. Mill is a white savior trying to rescue the dark skinned tribes), or (d) criticisms of the idea that liberalism is a goal worthy of necessitating a dictatorship.

Again, this is just speculation on my part. This was not my focus when I studied political theory and so I'm just offering guesses as to what people today are saying in response to Mill."
491,AskPhilosophy,Introducing Philosophy to 14/15-year-olds; how can I do this effectively?,"When I was an ESL teacher in South Korea, I was given an 'advance placement' class of middle schoolers which allowed me greater freedom to design the lessons. Between the more standard ESL material, I had a few classes that were dedicated to philosophy, but the most successful of those was on the trolley cart scenario. 

I presented the scenario, surveyed their initial choices, then used that as an introduction to the major normative views (virtue ethics, deontology, consequentualism) as well as a reasonable case (historical background, motivations, etc.) for each, then surveyed the class again to see if their views had changed or had softened. The goal of the class wasn't, of course, to tell them an answer but to impart the value and difficulty of the question of normative ethical philosophy in general, and it was about as successful as I could hope. So you might want to dedicate a whole 30-minute presentation on that."
492,AskPhilosophy,*Why* are Jordan Peterson's philosophical opinions wrong?,"On postmodernism, apparently Peterson is getting his account of it from Hicks' *Explaining Postmodernism*. For a sentiment like those already expressed here, but in the literature, here's Lorkovic's assessment of Hicks' thesis in *Philosophy in Review* 25(4):

> Stephen R.C. Hicks' Explaining Postmodernism is a polemic in primer's clothing. What opens innocently enough as an intellectual history of postmodernism and its rise to academic respectability quickly uncovers its true intentions as a bitter condemnation...   

> I have two reservations about this text. First, whereas Hicks' rejection of postmodernism is [meant to be] supported by summaries of its key figures, the book is surprisingly 'light' on exposition... [and such] cursory summaries do the history of thought and its students a serious injustice. Whether Hicks' interpretations are right or wrong is only a secondary concern (although I believe too many of his interpretations are more wrong than right). The problem is that a reader has no basis in Hicks' text itself to assess those interpretations. After all, interpretations need as much defense as arguments in order to be convincing. What's more, since the results of Hicks' interpretations serve as the basic premises of his subsequent critical argument, a thorough hermeneutics is indispensable. Second, although it accuses (rightly I think) postmodernism of being too polemical, Hicks' text is itself an extended polemic. Instead of disproving postmodernism, Hicks dismisses it; instead of taking postmodernism seriously and analyzing it carefully on its terms, Hicks oversimplifies and trivializes it, seemingly in order to justify his own prejudice against postmodernism. If postmodernism is in fact untenable, which it very well might be, Stephen Hicks has unfortunately not demonstrated that.

The Hicks-Peterson account of the relevant philosophical developments is that (i) postmodernism starts with Rousseau and Kant, (ii) who are irrationalists, and (iii) it becomes popular among socialists, (iv) because socialism is inconsistent with being reasonable and so socialists are obliged to reject reason. Every single one of these claims is astonishing, and at odds with mainstream scholarship. But there's no attempt to engage the mainstream scholarship to show where it errs, nor are these positions developed through a sustained engagement with the primary sources. So there's not really much scholarly work to do here, beyond objecting to the quality of this kind of scholarship and pointing people to mainstream scholarship on these issues--as Lorkovic says, the crucial problem is that there isn't the kind of scholarly work backing up these theses, that is needed for a sustained and critical appraisal of them."
493,AskPhilosophy,Is it ethical for people with highly heritable diseases to be having children?,"The SEP has a [really good page](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eugenics/) on philosophy and eugenics that may help to contextualize this question.

From a strictly utilitarian point of view, let’s break this down paragraph by paragraph:

-	If I am not mistaken, the Danish study you reference is [approximately 40 years old](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7258382/) and was highly controversial at the time, one of the reasons being the small sample size. I would be skeptical of its conclusions unless they have been more thoroughly substantiated.
-	To the extent that its conclusions may be correct (and I am by no means conceding that they are), they deal with parents who *both* have schizophrenia, which is not relevant to the example you give in the third paragraph in which only one parent has schizophrenia.
-	You ask whether it’s morally praiseworthy to choose the donor parent. A good argument could be made that *either* option is morally praiseworthy; that’s a separate question from the one you describe in the second paragraph, which is whether it is “unethical for parents with a highly heritable and serious disease to have children.” Something can be morally praiseworthy without being the only ethical option. A good example of this is gratuious altruism: it isn’t unethical not to throw yourself on a grenade to save your platoon, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t praiseworthy to do it.
-	There is no neutral donor parent! What are the traits of this donor parent, disease-related or otherwise? How enthusiastic is the wife about this arrangement? How enthusiastic is the husband? How enthusiastic is the donor? (Obviously if they all consent, there is no obstacle regardless of their moral reasoning; they can say they want the donor’s sperm because he can hit the high note singing “Loving You” at karaoke and it’d still be perfectly valid.) Can the donor accept his role without trying to become an active parent? Could the donor have undiagnosed schizophrenia himself, rendering no genetic advantage to his donation? These are all questions that would have to be addressed in any serious ethical analysis of the situation, even if we accept the eugenic approach as valid; the individual human context must be considered."
494,AskPhilosophy,How do I educate myself so that I can actually change anything?,"I suggest reading a LOT. I was a fan of Ayn Rand as a teen -- everybody makes mistakes. Read a lot from diverse perspectives and you won't fall into an intellectual trap like that of Peterson or Rand. If you want something on education that has been influential, I recommend reading Dewey and Freire. There's so much to learn and read. You have many years to learn. Use them.

For your speech, I'd say pick a few smaller or more recent essays that inspire you (not Peterson please -- he's not as smart or intellectually honest as he sounds). Maybe come up with an idea, theme, recent or historical event to comment on. After that, it's all about finding evidence, thinking of good points, writing that speech (and making references so as not to plagiarize). Good luck!"
495,AskPhilosophy,Can the universe exist without a conscious being to examine it?,"You may be interested in [**George Berkeley**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley), who questioned whether something can exist without perception by consciousness (e.g., [**if a tree falls in the forest**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest) with no one around to hear it, does it make a sound). As you seem to be suggesting, how can we suggest that anything exists without the ability to perceive it or even experience any sensation dependent on its existence? From these questions, Berkeley developed [**subjective idealism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_idealism), which is a metaphysical theory associated with immaterialism positing that things exist if they are perceived. Berkeley believed that things are metaphysically impossible if they are independent of a mind to observe them. So I believe that in this theory, your uninhabited universe would not exist. To me, the question is similar to that of [**noumena**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noumenon), things that exist independently of perception. To properly answer your question, you would need to decide whether an object is distinct from ([**substance theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_theory)) or tied to ([**bundle theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_theory)) its properties. If the universe's existence is contingent on the bundle of properties including its perceptions then without them it can't exist.

**NB:** I am not educated in philosophy, I'm just an interested amateur. If I'm misinformed, please don't hesitate to point out how."
496,AskPhilosophy,How is suffering a choice?,"> Like, think of it from a Myth of Sisyphus perspective. It seems like if you believe suffering is a choice, then you’d say ‘well, we have to imagine sisyphus happy because he believes one day the boulder will stay at the top. He has found meaning in his task, so he does not suffer.’ But it’s not like he /chose/ to be rolling the boulder every day- he has to! And if he couldn’t find meaning in the task, that’s not his fault, is it? You can’t force yourself to not suffer. You don’t have control over these things.

Sure, but Camus' point is the opposite one that you're trying to make here.  Sisyphus doesn't control the physical discomfort of pushing the rock, but he can control his orientation to it.  That is, he wills himself out of existential anguish by engaging in an act of rebellion.  (Also, he doesn't do it by pretending he can succeed.)

Now, we might ask whether or not everyday people can will themselves out of suffering like Sisyphus does.  This is a question for psychologists, of course!"
497,AskPhilosophy,What does the philosophy curriculum of universities in non-western countries look like?,"Philippines. There’s definitely a placed emphasis on Eastern Philosophy. The curriculum is still dominantly Western, but there are efforts to popularize Eastern schools of thought, especially Filipino philosophy. The most famous Philosophy teacher in my school specializes in Zen Buddhism."
498,AskPhilosophy,Why not build up philosophy like math?,"I don't think it is clear this is how math works to be honest.  It is definitely not how science works, except in retrospect.  If we discuss why that is, then perhaps that will be helpful.  Mathematical progress frequently precedes solid foundations for the subject matter.  Calculus for instance was developed via positing infinitesimals, which were not rigorously developed, and in fact explicitly did not satisfy the standards of rigour of the day (see Berkeley's *The Analyst*, which applies a Euclidean standard of well-formedness to limit calculations and finds them wanting).  Calculus was then developed further until in roughly the early 19th century the (considered rigorous) epsilon-delta standard for a limit was developed, and in the mid 20th century we in fact found (the first, but not last) rigorous formulation of infinitesimals.  The latter results are a bit of a hit with physicists who enjoy arguing with infinitesimals, but in mathematics they're more of a curiosity because (i) mathematicians are used to using the epsilon-delta style in a wide array of contexts now, contexts that infinitesimal proofs don't necessarily exist for, and (ii) the infinitesimal formulation is demonstrably conservative over the epsilon-delta style - that is, it will never give you a different result than the epsilon-delta style.

What can we take away from that that is relevant to philosophy?  Well, first off, that serious progress can happen outside of axiomatic formulations of a theory.  Second, that foundational questions may ultimately be irrelevant to deciding certain higher-level questions.  The first is not shocking, and perhaps it doesn't feel like it really does much to address your worry, since it is ultimately about whether we can do *more* if we adopt an axiomatic approach.  I think empirically the answer to that is no, but I'm not going to dwell on it.  The second worry might be a little more novel, and I think we can make some progress discussing it via some examples: Spinoza, Carnap, and Sen.

Spinoza wrote two books in the 'geometric style', that is, from axioms and definitions.  One was an account of his system, the *Ethics*, the other was an account of the Cartesian system, the *Principles*, a system he was sympathetic with.  I will focus on the former.  In the *Ethics* we have theorems, axioms, and definitions, but it has been repeatedly observed that much of the interesting work happens in the ""notes"" (or scholia as they're frequently called because the text is in Latin).  This is because of many things: for instance, that he has to reply to other author's views, or because the geometric method makes some concept superfluous, and so it is not liable to show up in the set of theorems, and if he wants to discuss it it must be in a supplement.  The geometric method turns out to be bad for when you want to have a discussion rather than just outline your own view.

Carnap takes a similar approach, again inspired by the axiomatic method, in *Logical Structure of the World* (or the *Aufbau* because the English title is a bit wordy).  Ultimately we get something similar happening: the first two thirds of the book are very dry, and then he addresses philosophical questions in the final part, and the discussion ultimately doesn't depend on much more than the fact that his earlier system exists.  By that I mean he doesn't say ""my earlier discussion proves causation is an unnecessary fundamental notion"", rather he says more-or-less, ""look at what we're able to talk about without invoking a notion of causation"".  It doesn't follow from any substantive statement from his system, rather it follows from the bare fact that his system is (presumably) possible.  That's one sense in which systems ultimately turn out to be irrelevant to settling disputes.

Sen provides a more interesting example, he doesn't develop a geometric system.  Instead he tries to show that regardless of what approach you use, you can reach consensus on various higher-level facts, and this is in part due to the importance of empirical considerations for actually deciding many philosophical questions (esp. in politics), and how weak the necessary non-empirical premises are.  I'll give an example from his text, *The Idea of Justice* that perhaps will make this clear:

> Perhaps a more immediate, and more contemporary, illustration of this general point about congruent implications can be given by considering a recent event, involving the decision of the US government to launch a military invasion of Iraq in 2003. There are diverse ways of judging decisions of this kind, but the point to be considered here is that it is possible that a number of distinct and divergent arguments can still lead to the same conclusion – in this case, that the policy chosen by the US-led coalition in starting the war in Iraq in 2003 was mistaken.

> Consider the different arguments that have been presented, each with considerable plausibility, as critiques of the decision to go to war in Iraq. First, the conclusion that the invasion was a mistake can be based on the necessity for more global agreement, particularly through the United Nations, before one country could justifiably land its army on another country. A second argument can focus on the importance of being well informed, for example on the facts regarding the presence or absence of weapons of mass destruction in pre-invasion Iraq, before taking such military decisions, which would inevitably place a great many people in danger of being slaughtered or mutilated or displaced. A third argument may be concerned with democracy as ‘government by discussion’ (to use that old phrase often linked with John Stuart Mill, but which was used earlier by Walter Bagehot), and concentrate instead on the political significance of informational distortion in what is presented to the people of the country, including cultivated fiction (such as the imaginary links of Saddam Hussein with the events on 9/11 or with al-Qaeda), making it harder for the citizens of America to assess the executive proposal to go to war. A fourth argument could see the principal issue to be none of the above, but instead the actual consequences of the intervention: would it bring peace and order in the country invaded, or in the Middle East, or in the world, and could it have been expected to reduce the dangers of global violence and terrorism, rather than intensifying them?

> These are all serious considerations and they involve very different evaluative concerns, none of which could be readily ruled out as being irrelevant or unimportant for an appraisal of actions of this kind. And in general, they may not yield the same conclusion. But if it is shown, as in this specific example, that all of the sustainable criteria lead to the same diagnosis of a huge mistake, then that specific conclusion need  not  await  the  determination  of  the  relative  priorities  to  be attached to these criteria. Arbitrary reduction of multiple and potentially conflicting principles to one solitary survivor, guillotining all the other evaluative criteria, is not, in fact, a prerequisite for getting useful and robust conclusions on what should be done. This applies as much to the theory of justice as it does to any other part of the discipline of practical reason.

Politics is an excellent example I think.  If your view on politics is X, the truth is that you probably expect that someone who considers the matter very seriously wouldn't have to agree with your views on ethics in order to be an X-ist.  You probably think that a Kantian, a utilitarian, or a virtue ethicist who considered the matter seriously would ultimately have to agree with you.  For that reason it is ultimately more important to get the high-level stuff right, and not worry quite as much about foundations.  This point of view in political philosophy (and related areas) is known as non-ideal theory.

I also want to address one worry you mention in a comment:

> Then I think you could try to equate the opinion to something else that IS self-evident/an axiome.

Part of what makes philosophy hard is that there doesn't appear to be many arguments of this kind.  David Enoch gives an interesting discussion of what consequences one might draw from this observation in *Taking Morality Seriously*."
499,AskPhilosophy,"How do philosophers who deny the reality of either time or consciousness explain the illusion of time and consciousness? Just as Descartes showed I cannot coherently doubt that I'm doubting, why isn't it incoherent to maintain that it only SEEMS that I am consciously experiencing time?","A dissertation I recently read deals with just this problem (Turner 2007). There the author proposes a C+A -theory to account for both our conscious experience time as well as the ontology of time. The author draws upon McTaggart (and uses McTaggart's A-B-C series as his terminology) as well as analytic philosophers and phenomenological thinkers to explain how our common sense view of time and 'real time' could be integrated. If you're seriously interested in the topic, the dissertation is worth reading."
500,AskPhilosophy,Why did Kierkegaard oppose the stoics?,"I cannot recall direct passages where Kierkegaard engages with the Stoics, but having studied both it makes sense that he would oppose them. The Stoics believe that the universe is run by a purely rational God and that all universal events are manifestations of God’s rational will. The world itself is thus perfectly rational, and religious piety can be achieved through studying and affirming the world as it is. Kierkegaard believes, on the other hand, that if the universe is ultimately rational then any divine experience will occur outside of the universe and must transcend the rational and the universal. God cannot be understood rationally by human reason. Religion begins with a leap from reason, a leap of faith. Only such a leap does justice to the difference between humanity and God, between the world and the divine. The stoics can be said to anthropomorphize God by arguing that the human intellect is capable of understanding the divine and living wholly in accordance with it. For Kierkegaard, due to our sinful nature, such a life is impossible. We live fallen from the divine unto death where, only via the grace of God, we might be saved. Such salvation is never something we could rationally comprehend."
501,AskPhilosophy,How do I learn about Hegel without having to actually read him?,"There are a couple issues which complicate the answer to this question. In a sense, it all depends on *which* Hegel you want to learn. One can certainly read secondary material which gives an intepretation of Hegel's project, but without any engagement with the primary source, you will be left largely unable to do 2 key things: (1) distinguish between better or worse interpretations and (2) thereby, determine when a disagreement you have with 'Hegel' is actually with him, or with an interpreter's idiosyncratic reading of him. 

While I believe it is generally worthwhile to engage with Hegel's primary source material, you may have specific reasons for your need to engage with Hegel that, given the difficulty of such study, make this a less valuable way to spend your time. For example, if you are really just interested in the influence of Hegel on French thought in the latter half of the 20th century, (e.g. because you want to just understand *those* projects more thoroughly), then you may not *absolutely* need to read Hegel directly -- (however, I would still of course personally recommend it.) The reason for this is that this influence was, by and large, shaped by the readings of Hegel developed by Kojeve and Hyppolite. Still, it might be argued that any adequate understanding of a philosophical project would include recognition of where that project's plausibility (or validity or whatever) depends on *mis*-understanding or only partially understanding some project to which it takes itself to respond. In that case, it may become worthwhile, yet again, to read the original texts of Hegel. 

Now, that's just one example, but hopefully it gives a sense of what I mean. There are many good introductory books on Hegel, but a number of them disagree on basic issues. As such, it might be helpful if you provided a little bit more context. 

As such, the first thing I might do is point you to the [SEP article on Hegel](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hegel/), which gives both a rough summary of the comparatively uncontested understanding of Hegel's philosophy and a breakdown of some of the larger disagreements in the secondary literature. Likewise, it generally cites the figures to whom the major interpetative stances belong, so you can probably follow it's direction if one or the other sounds most relevant or compelling to you.

I hope that helps!"
502,AskPhilosophy,Are there any philosophers who justify making decisions according to their narrative value?,been a while since i’ve looked at it but you might want to check out Nehemas esp. his famous book on Nietzsche
503,AskPhilosophy,is contemporary physics stalling because it neglects philosophy?,"It seems doubtful to me that physics is stalling. Hossenfelder is correct that physics needs philosophy (there are philosophical assumptions in any scientific enterprise); however, I doubt it's a lack of philosophizing that prevents progress in particle physics.

First of all, when Hossenfelder talks about physics ""stalling"", she is referring specifically to HEP (high energy physics) theory. HEP theory is, all things considered, only a small part of physics in terms of the number of physicists working on it. If we take some other field, such as condensed matter or plasma physics, there is no ""stalling"" as far as I can see. Similarly astronomy seems to be in a good shape, with the James Webb telescope due to be launched next year. Even in particle physics, there is a fair bit of work going in to formalizing quantum field theories.

On the topic of HEP theory or fundamental particle physics, it may be that it's the lack of philosophical insight that is hindering us from creating a better theory. But this seems like an unlikely explanation for many reasons. Firstly, there are, in fact, many physicists who are interested in philosophy -- for example, most people who work in philosophy of physics have a physics degree. Nima Arkani-Hamed, a highly respected particle physicist, has given lectures on the philosophy of fundamental physics (not academic philosophy, but philosophy in the sense of explaining his reasoning for working the way he does), [see here; he actually discusses your question in a roundabout way](https://www.cornell.edu/video/nima-arkani-hamed-philosophy-of-fundamental-physics-1).

Second, there is actually hardly a shortage of ideas for unification of QM and GR, even rather wild ideas. What is really lacking is the experimental data. It is expected that quantum gravity is very difficult to detect, which means that you need high-energy machines to find indications of it. But high-energy machines are extremely expensive to build, and the only entities that would build them are governments. So it's not so easy to get more useful experimental data out.

It may be that Hossenfelder is right and she is the ""only physicist who has at least come up with an idea for what to do"" (as she claims), but if this is the case, I have to wonder where Hossenfelder's own fantastic breakthroughs are. If she knows the way forward, why isn't she doing it? Her advice is to ""resolve inconsistencies"", as though that isn't a two-word description of the search for unification -- which is exactly what people have been trying to do in the 40 years in which physics supposedly stalled.

None of this is to say, by the way, that many physicists don't take a lax attitude to philosophy, or that there shouldn't be more diverse  funding in e.g. fundamental physics. One could make a justified argument that string theory has been over-funded, though I have the sense that is changing (it's a tempting field, because string theorists only require papers and pens, and thus very little funding!)"
504,AskPhilosophy,"Are there any philosophers who advocate actions that specifically run counter to the logic of productivity, self-improvement, and ""making the most out of life""?",Theodor W. Adorno fits your description. He deeply criticized the way that capitalist logic inflitrates our daily thought ans action.
505,AskPhilosophy,"If a virtuous man does virtuous acts more easily, are his acts less virtuous?","I don't think anyone argues that someone who acts more easily is *less* virtuous (although people misread Kant as saying this). There is however a vigorous debate over whether acting more easily is *more* virtuous, or whether virtue is actually just a matter of doing the right things, and it's more impressive if you can do the right thing even if it's hard. (""More impressive"" doesn't mean ""more virtuous,"" but that's very close.) For the classic sources on this debate, see Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics* (in which he argues that the person who feels good about being virtuous is more virtuous than the person who doesn't) and Kant's *Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals* (in which he argues that doing the right thing is what matters, and feeling good about it makes no difference)."
506,AskPhilosophy,"I heard somewhere that Machiavelli wrote The Prince kind of ironically, largely to placate (and even ridicule) the Medicis, who were already ruling by some of the ruthless methods he outlined in the text. Any truth or evidence to that?","A really important study of Machiavelli by the French philosopher Louis Althusser covers exactly this. The book is called 'Machiavelli and Us', and in it Althusser looks into not only his writings in The Prince, but also the rest of his political corpus and realises that Machiavelli was engaging in a pre-Marxist 'ruthless criticism of all that is', insofar as the dystopian vision of the state which he portrays is actually a criticism of the extant material conditions which demand such a use of power as the Prince must ultimately implement.

Provided that Althusser's assessment of Machiavelli is correct (I'll assume it is; I certainly haven't read Machiavelli's entire political corpus) then it seems like Machiavelli was in fact opposed to the autocratic rule which The Prince adumbrates.

Hope this helps!"

509,AskPhilosophy,How can someone believe in personal responsibility if they do not believe that free will exists?,"Strawson argues that we have sufficient negative freedoms - we're not coerced, incapacitated, mentally ill, etc. - to be responsible for our actions. In addition, punishments and rewards make sense because if punishments and rewards were not given out now, the future would not be as such that we act in accordance with the past punishments and rewards."
510,AskPhilosophy,Is it immoral to end the world?,"I think that only a strong negative (hedonic) utilitarian (for whom the cessation of suffering is all that matters) would be the only sort of philosopher who would say that it would not be immoral to press the button. Some other sorts of hedonic utilitarians who think that the net suffering of life outweighs that net happiness may also say that it's okay to press the button, but it would depend a lot on whether there would be other methods of fixing this problem. For example, suppose that there is a chance that with enough luck and technological innovation, there will be a future of almost infinite happiness for people (and animals) and almost no suffering. If this chance exists, then those hedonic utilitarians would be pressed to find some defense of their choice to press the button, which would, in effect cancel out all our chances of achieving that future. Finally, desire and preference-based utilitarians of many sorts would say that it would be immoral to press the button because even if life were largely suffering, you are frustrating or thwarting the strong desires or preferences of living beings to continue living. Finally, of course, utilitarianism might not be the right ethical theory at all. I can't think of any deontologists who would say that such a decision would be permissible, for example.

So in summary, the vast majority of ethical camps would say it's immoral and you'd have to turn to some pretty obscure and difficult-to-defend positions (such as that utilitarianism is true and happiness doesn't morally matter AT ALL or that we have very, very low chances of solving the problems of suffering in other ways) in order to confidently say it's permissible. This is at least my humble take on this issue."
511,AskPhilosophy,"If we live in a deterministic universe, free will is impossible. I've looked into compatibilism and it's either a dazzling evasion or I just don't get it. What am I missing?","The short story is that compatibilism denies this:

> If we live in a deterministic universe, free will is impossible.

So, the argument between Hard Determinists and Compatibilists is about the necessary conditions for Free Will.   Some people think this is a cheap semantic move or something evasive, but it isn't - it's a conceptual argument about how the burden of Free Will should be understood.

Imagine someone came up to you and said, ""Hey - did you know that you can *never* make a good decision because you can *never* know what will happen with absolute certainty?""  Most people would say, ""Well, no kidding I can't know what's going to happen, but that isn't a very good way to define a ""good decision.""   That's a useless and unhelpful way to think about decision making, especially good decisions in comparison to bad decisions.""  This isn't a trivial game of word golf here - this is a substantive dispute about how we should think about what it means to make a ""good decision.""  Importantly, there isn't some rock somewhere that we turn over which has this definition printed on it.

""Free Will"" is the same way.  We might first ask what the concept is supposed to do.  One thing it is often thought to do is be a necessary condition for moral responsibility.  That is, I can't be blamed for what I do if I had no control over what I'm doing.  Once we can agree on that much (that Free Will is the thing you'd need to be morally responsible), then it should become clear that it's not obvious that libertarian free will (the kind of free will which determinism would deny - the weird freedom from causality) is necessary for moral responsibility.  As a result, there have been lots of theories of moral responsibility which accept determinism going back, at least, to the ancient stoics (who developed a pretty famous ethical system and were causal determinists).

In sum - it's hard to know what you do or don't ""get,"" but it may just be that you have found yourself in that spot that a lot of first-time readers of compatibilism have found themselves in - thinking that the compatibilist is trying to pull a fast one or something.  That's not what's happening.  If anything, it's the Hard Determinists who are doing this, by trying to claim the necessary conditions for Free Will were decided already in a way which can't be contested.  This is nonsense.  Abstract and material terms are subject to contest and revision.  If they weren't, then the Hard Determinists couldn't avail themselves of a modern definition of causality.

ETA - My above analogy seems to have been helpful, but also a bit misleading.  So, to clarify a part of my analogy:

> Most people would say, ""Well, no kidding I can't know what's going to happen, but that isn't a very good way to define a ""good decision."" That's a *useless* and unhelpful way to think about decision making, especially good decisions in comparison to bad decisions.""

Some folks have seized on one clause in this hypothetical, but, really, I didn't mean it to be terribly important.  Really the argument here is about a *good* definition for Free Will.  (To be fair, I do also think that important concepts need some kind of utility.)  The argument between my two imagined persons is about the *better* way to think about a particular concept.  I avoid saying ""right"" or ""accurate"" here to avoid some other conceptual problems, though I think it's all the same thing.

Anyway, imagine an alternate situation instead from the point of view of the libertarian.  Say that the libertarian meets a person who declares, ""We have no free will!""  The Libertarian says, ""Oh, yes!  I agree!  But, just in case, why do you think this?""  The interlocutor says, ""Oh, well, having free will requires that I can do what I want.  I want to fly.  I cannot fly.  Therefore, I cannot do what I want to do.  Therefore, I don't have free will.""

Whatever we can say about Libertarians, they don't believe *this*.  Clearly the Libertarian disagrees with this interlocutor.  Wherein lies the disagreement?  Probably the Libertarian will say this, ""No - I think you're a bit confused about what it might mean to 'do what you want' or else you're just confused about what having Free Will entails.""  (Also, by the way, might not the Libertarian point out that this is a very silly way to think about Free Will given that everyone knows before the conversation starts that humans can't will themselves into flight?  This interlocutor has defined and ended the argument before it started.)

Anyway, here, the Libertarian would not be engaging in some semantic mumbo jumbo by trying to show this person that they've conceived of things wrongly.  If the Libertarian's response to this interlocutor is mumbo jumbo, then what does their own position even amount to?  Neither party of this dispute can turn over a rock to see who wins - they'll need to give some arguments for thinking that Free Will requires [x] or [y] - regardless of whether or not is *exists*.

As others have pointed out below, people have some kind of conception of Free Will and what matters about it, but this doesn't mean that all of those conceptions make sense or are equally good or, if you're willing, are *true*.  When we ask people what they think about Free Will, we learn *something*, but we don't obviously learn something about Free Will *itself*.  In the same way, we could ask people on the street what Time is and not learning anything about Time *itself*.  Here too, there is no easy rock to look under to find out what Time *is* (or else the A vs B debate would be long dead).  Or, if you don't buy this analogy, consider that folk definitions of Free Will almost always rely on a notion of Causation, and yet folk notions of Causation are often totally at odds with even what scientists think causation is like (much less philosophers).

Anyway, all I meant to do above is show one way to see how the argument between Hard Determinists and Compatibilists is something other than word golf or semantics.  And, to be really clear, philosophers who are divided about this are not confused here - folks in all the camps about Free Will give rather sustained arguments for their positions and understand this to be totally necessary to making their position justifiable - even the libertarians and hard determinists.

As a final amendment, some folks have suggested that what Compatibilists are doing is making a ""new"" definition for Free Will.  This also isn't true, since Compatibilist arguments go back *at least* to the Ancient Greek Stoics.  If that counts as ""new,"" well, then *everything* about modern hard determinism, unless, of course, Hard Determinists are using a theory of physical causation, the soul, and human motivation derived from Aristotle.  (Some do this, of course!)"
512,AskPhilosophy,"Why did the phenomena of the ""scientist philosopher"" end after WWII?","
A major factor that hasn't been mentioned is the increasing professionalization and specialization of the disciplines.  There's so much competition for graduate/postdoctoral positions, prestigious grants/fellowships, and so on that one's incentivized to focus solely on their discipline during their education/training.  The sheer amount of material in all of the various fields has grown dramatically as well since the first half of the 20th century.

I'd originally intended to go the academic route in one of the life sciences and I did a double honours degree which left me something like 5 or 6 electives outside of science/mathematics.  I ended up going to a top research university (and dropped out) and this sort of background was more or less the norm.  You're probably not getting exposed to philosophy in university at that point and most of your peers are in STEM.  It doesn't leave a lot of leisure time and philosophy is already a pretty niche interest.

It very much reflects different approaches to training and education.  It's very much a shame."
513,AskPhilosophy,How Should I Get Into Slovaj Zizek?,"You can read Žižek directly without preparation, in my opinion. *The Sublime Object of Ideology* is the book that made his name in English, so I recommend starting there.

514,AskPhilosophy,"Why did Bulgakov in ""The Master and Margarita"" write: ""No wonder Schiller said that only slaves could be satisfied with Kant's arguments on this subject, while Strauss simply laughed at his proof.""?","The expression by Berlioz: ""Schiller say that the Kantian reasoning on this question can satisfy only slaves"" was probably an almost verbatim quote from the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, from the article ""God"".

Which could have been a subtle way for Bulgakov to mock Berlioz's superficial knowledge of this complicated subject, as Berlioz sort of mindlessly uses a cliche, that he just memorized, possibly without putting much thought into it.

The reason why that was phrased this way in the article is because Schiller was an aesthete and to him Kant's morality was too dry and mechanic, it almost required following strict and austere monastic rules, while suppressing any sensuality, which Schiller valued. So it was like an algorithm created by a pure mind that a human must robotically follow in the pursuit of a higher good, which for Schiller, who valued feelings and beauty might have looked as as a life of a slave, automatically following master's orders.

That could have been loosely the train of thought of the author(s) of the article.

As for the Strauss line, it's also a reference to the same dictionary, which has this phrase in it: ""Strauss mockingly points out, that Kant to his system (which opposes theism in spirit) attached a little room and put God into it"".

The reason why there is such a phrase in the article is probably due to a quote from Strauss, who wrote that (loose translation) this Kantian moral proof is a kind of a janitor room, where God, after the resignation from Kantian system, could still receive maintenance and still had things to do."
515,AskPhilosophy,Is Zizek actually worth reading?,"There was a big thread on this recently with literally the same question but I think it got deleted because I can no longer find it my comment history.

Zizek is treated very seriously in the areas that actually pertain to his work, ie. German Idealism, Psychoanalysis and theory of Ideology.

If you've read Deleuze, I'd recommend his book on Deleuze, which I like a lot (*Organs Without Bodies*). It's oddly prescient (like a lot of Zizek's older stuff) in that it already formulates many of the current en-vogue criticisms of Deleuze.

Other than that the obvious starting point is *The Sublime Object Of Ideology*."

The weak interpretation however, which says that language influences language to some degree, is widely agreed upon.

519,AskPhilosophy,How do trans people know that they are a gender different from the one they were assigned?,"This is partially just a psychological or sociological question. But from philosophy (in my humble opinion), the clearest conception of what it means to be trans has come from Jenkins (2016). So be a little patient with me here, since I'll come back to your question after I explain her concept. Basically, one has some gender if and only if one's ""internal ‘map’ is formed to guide someone classed as a member of X gender through the social or material realities that are, in that context, characteristic of Xs as a class"". So,

&#x200B;

""S has a female gender identity iff (if and only if) S’s internal ‘map’ is formed to guide someone classed as a woman through the social or material realities that are, in that context, characteristic of women as a class.""

&#x200B;

However, one can both identify as a woman AND resist typical stereotypes of what it means to be a woman (as an aside this is a key point that TERFs-- or so-called ""gender critical"" feminists-- often overlook). So for example, someone may be a trans woman but also resist the norm that women should shave their legs, even if it's part of the usual 'map' towards womanhood that we learn. What's important is that they take the norm to be relevant to themselves, even if they resist it. (""Her experience of social and material reality includes navigating the norm that women should have hairless legs, even though she is not complying with it"") I highly recommend this essay as a way of making sense of and validating trans people even given a radical feminist position on womanhood.

&#x200B;

Getting back to your question, we might reframe it as this: ""How does a trans woman take the 'map' of cultural norms and guidelines associated with womanhood to be relevant to herself?"" This doesn't seem very strange to me, since growing up we learn about the norms of both genders, in large part we learn the norms of the other gender in contrast with the norms of our own to better understand our own gender norms. True, someone raised as a woman MAY learn these norms in more detail, but we all certainly have a basic notion of the norms for both genders. So then it's just a matter of which norms, or which 'internal map', one takes to be relevant to oneself. It strikes me as implausible to think that one must be treated by others as if the norms applied to oneself (as cis women are treated) in order to learn these norms sufficiently. (The second paragraph on u/wobblie's answer here gives some excellent supporting reasons as to why this idea is implausible). But again, this part of the question might be better aimed at a sociologist."
520,AskPhilosophy,"It seems like one must spend years digging through and deeply engaging with both primary and secondary sources in order to properly understand contemporary philosophical debates. How, then, can a layman best engage with philosophy?","Reddit decided my original post was too long, so here's what else I had to say:

What level of understanding can one aspire to without studying philosophy? Is such a level beneficial, even though a more learned person may claim a more nuanced view would render my (layman's) philosophical views incomplete or invalid?

I often get the impression that one cannot really have philosophical views until one has thoroughly read a huge list of texts (and not just read, but spent time churning them over and analysing them). But I know my time is finite, and I just simply do not have the time to do this as well as deeply understanding my other interests (especially that one I am paid to be interested in). 

As a physicist, I'm keenly aware that laypeople who want to ""get into"" physics often deeply misunderstand key aspects of the subject. I'm also aware that there is a huge difference between learning *about* physics and actually learning physics. I know the general public won't learn Lagrangian mechanics, and will never understand or care about the lengthy and in-depth agreements I have with colleagues about, for example, how many degrees of freedom my problem has, or whether a given phenomenon is ""truly"" quantum. But, at the same time, lay people can learn *about* physics, and can sort of understand my work on a basic ""no maths, no details"" level, or a ""how does this affect me"" level. Even if they cant grasp the process, they can be told (some of) the results. I naively assume that philosophy is similar, and that while as a non-philosopher I can't expect to know philosophy well enough to actually contribute, but I would like to know it well enough to know how it should affect me, both in my work and my day-to-day life. I would also like to know the topic well enough to know when non-experts are making dubious claims in the name of philosophy.

So how do I proceed? Is it possible for one who has no intention of *doing* philosophy to have a good grasp of what philosophers have to say? How deeply can I expect to engage in philosophical texts? At what point do I just have to give in to the authority of experts? And when I reach that point, how do I know who those experts are, and what exactly it is that they are authoritatively trying to tell me?

Any input, either from the actual experts or from other lay people with this same problem, would be greatly appreciated."
521,AskPhilosophy,"If we emerged into existence once, whose to say we can’t do it again or haven’t already before?",">So how do we know that 13 billion years after my death another instance of my consciousness could rise again?

It's definitely possible that another instance of consciousness could arise after 13 billion years. But what could make it an instance of *your* consciousness in particular? This is broadly the problem of [personal identity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/) across time. We say that your consciousness now and your consciousness five minutes ago are instances of the same person's consciousness because, perhaps, they're produced by the same brain, or they're linked by memory, or they're causally connected in the right way. No matter what explanation we give, it's unlikely that this explanation will say that a consciousness emerging 13 billion years in the future could just happen to be *your* consciousness."
522,AskPhilosophy,Is there any work of philosophy that gives advice to people who were not born particularly intelligent or talented? or to those who are insecure about their abilities and intellect?,"I don't know if you need a specific work of philosophy to address this. Maybe just some life advice. Here's mine: 

Intelligence is like strength in a way. There's a certain amount that everyone needs, and if you have much more beyond that amount, it doesn't do you much practical good. The strongest man in the world and I have vastly different amounts of physical strength, and I doubt that in our lives outside the gym we encounter many situations where he fares better than me because he can crush a human skull with his bare hands. In fact, his strength probably poses problems for him that I don't have to deal with. 

Intelligence is like this. The things that you need to be able to understand to live a good human life are well within your grasp if you have that bare minimum degree of intelligence. If you want to understand more, then it may take you more time or effort, but things are still within your grasp.  

I also suspect that your anxiety about your intelligence is less about your actual intelligence (which is extremely hard to evaluate because it comes in so many varieties), and more about the things you've been told about yourself."
523,AskPhilosophy,Have some philosophers regarded Jesus as a philosopher? Was Jesus a philosopher?,"This is a difficult question, so I'm not surprised that this comment section is such a mess. 

Let's start with whether Jesus is regarded as a philosopher. [Some professors of philosophy have construed Jesus as a philosopher](https://philpapers.org/rec/KRETPO-3). This is far from typical, however. Kreeft is aware that his approach is unusual, which is why he devotes a chapter to justifying the project of reading Jesus as a philosopher. Most of the time, you won't read the New Testament in philosophy courses, and you'll almost never see professional philosophers reconstructing Jesus' ""arguments"" and then responding to them. 

Now, was he a philosopher? Your first difficulty is determining who qualifies as a philosopher. The second difficulty is picking the right lens for examining Jesus as a person. 

You can narrow your question down by picking what you mean by ""a philosopher."" Is it someone who does philosophy as a profession? That's not exactly what Jesus did for a living, he was either a carpenter or religious leader. (Take questions about this over to /r/academicbiblical). Well, maybe you meant to ask whether Jesus' teachings contributed something to the academic discipline of philosophy. This is going to be controversial, and some people think the answer is ""yes."" I don't think so, because Jesus' wise pithy sayings do not amount to arguments, and he often simply appeals to authority as a defense of the things he says. Occasionally he gives further reasons for the things he says, but I think this is a pretty low bar. He doesn't typically defend what he says in any kind of systematic way of anticipating objections and the like. 

Of course, all of this is going to also depend on what you think about Jesus and our sources regarding him. Arguably, we know very little about what he actually said and did (take this over to /r/academicbiblical). Or, you might be interested in whether the Jesus of the New Testament says things of philosophical value, regardless of historical accuracy. Or, you might believe he is God incarnate, in which case he might know literally everything, depending on your view of the [Incarnation.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/christiantheology-philosophy/#Inc) Even on this view, however, it's hard to see how he qualifies as a philosopher. An omniscient Jesus isn't investigating and arguing about competing worldviews, as he would have complete and immediate knowledge of *the* correct worldview in every respect."
524,AskPhilosophy,What exactly is systemic racism?,"> Which means we move into the space of historical legacy... here communities which have been ""shafted"" by past inequalities are still struggling with the repercussions decades later. History is deeply influential on the present so I have no problem with the idea that a legacy effect can be felt in the present even though the historical cause was a long time ago.

A significant form of this that has and continues to effect the economic mobility of black Americans is redlining and racial segregation in American cities. In the summer of 2015, I visited by brother in St. Louis, this being the year after the protests in Ferguson, and being there really drove home for me the reality of how the very urban geography perpetuates race-class divisions, alongside other things like militarized police. Such 'baked in' race-class segregation is present in a number of major cities in the United States of America. I'd say that this is definitely an important aspect of systematic racism in America, though not the whole story.

EDIT: [Here's a great article on the ongoing effects of segregationist public policies on Ferguson, which are duplicated in most major cities in the USA,](https://www.epi.org/publication/making-ferguson/) by the non-profit, non-partisan American think tank Economic Policy Institute."

Adorno is consonant with these ideas. Marshall Berman's *All That is Solid Melts into Air* is a great book to address these sorts of questions. Sartre's *Search for a Method* is probably worth your time, since it's about tying up his existentialism with his Marxism. It'd probably be worth looking at Fredric Jameson's *Marxism and Form*, too.

Or, as possibilities are insufficient to prove existence without phenomenal proofs to verify knots created brough a theoretical approach?

so, it depends on the approach. For example, from a mathematical perspective, knots can be derived theoretically, before they are properly proven in physical form, through an application of mathematical formulas of knots and so the mathematical possibilities are simply discovered for a particular knot. Or, an X-dimension knot may be logically calculated even if we are unable to properly prove its existence based on our limited parameters of perception, and may be closer to the idea of being invented since it can't be discovered by human bodies on accident.

So it would help to know what you intend by this distinction and what approach you are looking for more clarification on.

This method, in attempting to naturalise phenomenology, has been pretty controversial in both phenomenological and non-phenomenological circles.

By interpreting the act of committing the original sin, biting the forbidden apple, as ""wanting to know,"" he implicates that the Absurd is the fundamental human condition. I only see this as a rhetorical strategy; I don't think he means literally that the bible needs to be interpreted in that way."
537,AskPhilosophy,"When the synesthete says ""3 is green"", are they making a category mistake? Is what they're saying truth-apt?","This is an incredibly good question and I'm excited to see what someone with more experience with these specific questions will say on this, but:

Perhaps one could think of a synesthete's statements regarding the associations/sensations they experience through their synesthesia as being more akin to aesthetic judgements rather than statements of fact? So ""3 is green"" would be true from the perspective of ""I experience 3 as green"", rather than claiming an intrinsic property of 3."
538,AskPhilosophy,Is this a logical fallacy?,"I'd say it's equivocation of the word ""support"".

There's ""I would do anything within my ability to aid this cause"" and there's ""I agree with the objectives, motives, or aims of this cause"". The phrase ""I support this cause"" can mean either of these, but they are not the same."
539,AskPhilosophy,How does probability work in a deterministic universe?,"There are two conceptions of probability:

1. Epistemic probability
2. Metaphysical probability

Epistemic probability has to do with *your* ability to know and predict various things. For instance, even though it is completely determined whether some coin will be heads on the next flip, you personally *don't know* which of these outcomes will eventuate. The ""epistemic"" probability that it will land heads is 50%.

In a deterministic universe, nothing that happens in the universe is chancey. If you knew the state of all particles (e.g., their positions, momenta, etc.), you could deduce all subsequent states of the universe given the laws of nature. (See Laplace's Demon, for example.) According to determinism, the universe will unfold in one way only. This is presumably what you mean by ""wouldn't everything have a 100% probability?""

I'm not a physicist; however, the prevailing view in quantum mechanics—kindly correct me if I am wrong—is that the universe is *not* metaphysically deterministic. That is, there are events that are truly random, and it isn't merely a matter of your ability to know."
540,AskPhilosophy,Is it possible to get a decent understanding of the history of Western philosophy without formal training?,"Gaining an understanding of the history of Western philosophy is not something that ever comes to an end. I'm not sure anyone has read enough to 'understand' all of these thinkers, to completely exhaust the interpretative possibilities their works contain.

In other words, one is never finally ready to begin reading these thinkers, and one must always begin with an understanding that is imperfect and provisional - so long as you try to remember this, there is no reason you cannot start reading any of these thinkers tomorrow. 

That said, these thinkers (possibly with the exception of Sartre) are all especially difficult because of their engagement with wide-ranging, subtle, and tricky aspects of the history of philosophy - as I am sure you have either already gathered or had explained to you. Much will be lost on you, but that's ok. One of the main things a degree programme will give you (in most cases) is contact with peers who are also studying the material - peer discussion of the subject matter is a key element of learning, and so try to find a way to reproduce this (online discussion groups, etc.).

I can give you some tips on Derrida. Try to ignore anything you might have heard about him, stay away from wikipedia and Youtube, and read Leonard Lawlor's SEP article on Derrida, and then his *Derrida and Husserl: The Basic Problems of Phenomenology*. You should be able to work through this, though some bits might be tricky for a novice - use the SEP and the IEP to assist (IEP is much better on phenomenology for your intended purpose imho). To be honest, just these texts will give you a much better understanding of Derrida than 99% of people. If the book is too tricky, just move on to the next step and come back later.

This will give you (hopefully) an understanding of how Derrida's thought took shape and the questions he was interested in. You should learn a few things that will reveal the more widely-circulated theses attributed to Derrida to be complete nonsense. You should also get a decent understanding of how Hegel, Husserl, and Heidegger all influenced his thinking. After that, then go to a more traditional introduction. Jonathan Culler's *On Deconstruction* is still worth a read, whatever its flaws, and Christina Howells's *Derrida: A Critical Introduction* isn't bad.

As for reading Derrida's primary texts, my advice is to be patient, be very wary of underestimating his level of insight, and try not to be guided by things you might have heard about Derrida, and what you might *expect* him to say at any given point. A good starting point, in my opinion, is the essay ""Signature Event Context"" (in *Margins of Philosophy* and *Limited Inc*). If you can get anything out of it all, then that's great.

Feel free to ask here for specific clarification, or at r/Derrida or something like that. This is just an entry route I suggest, and is by no means comprehensive.

For Adorno I strongly recommend reading Simon Jarvis's *Adorno: A Critical Introduction*, it is great. A classic text is Gillian Rose's *The Melancholy Science.* As for his primary texts, maybe start with *Dialectic of Enlightenment* \- the second section on the culture industry, especially the part entitled ""Culture as Mass Deception"" (I think) are particularly readable. The essay ""The Essay as Form"" is a superb introduction to his work as well (in *Notes to Literature vol 1*).

For Heidegger, Richard Polt's introduction (I think it is called *Heidegger*) is very good - when I was an undergraduate we were all very grateful for this text. Try to read *Being and Time*, don't worry about not understanding all of it.

Honestly, between reading Derrida and Adorno you will over time get a reasonable understanding of certain other thinkers. Add to your knowledge with dedicated introductions to these texts over the years, and never stop rereading SEP and IEP articles to see how your understanding has changed. The *Very Short Introductions* series is generally good, so just pick up any you are interested in.

Essential reading, to be worked on over time: Kant, Hegel, Descartes, Plato, Aristotle, Husserl, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud. Try to get yourself in a position where you have at least some understanding of these thinkers' contributions to philosophy.

Don't be intimidated by this, at least don't let it put you off. You can start reading ""Signature Event Context"" tomorrow and not totally waste your time!

Hope this helps.

P.S. One more specific thing I will say about Derrida that will help you, but might not be clear yet: you will hear talk of Derrida's critique of the ""metaphysics of presence"". Just bear in mind that Derrida's project involves trying to track the ways in which the attempt to exit the metaphysics of presence always end up being caught within it (in other words it is by no means simply a rejection of this metaphysics). This also means that when he is writing about another thinker, he is *never* just criticizing them. Most of the time, he tries to write about thinkers who he thinks represent the most vigilant and radical efforts to overcome metaphysics, and to analyse how they fail, in spite of their efforts. Failing to grasp this is the source of so many misreadings of Derrida - people just don't really understand *what* he is trying to do with his deconstructive readings (especially in the cases of Husserl and J L Austin). IOW, Derrida is never interested in 'taking down' other thinkers - this  just doesn't seem to be something that ever interested him."
541,AskPhilosophy,What did Marx mean when he said that religion was the opiate of the masses?,"It's very important to stress that Marx never said this as a standalone sentence. The full quote reads very differently to the sentence fragment usually cited:

"" *Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions; it is the opium of the people.* ""

Marx's point in context thus becomes much clearer: religion is an expression of people's suffering and an attempt to survive in the face of it. 

Marx was unambiguously an atheist materialist, but he was not an ""anti-theist"" in the way that he has often been presumed to be.

So, if math is invented, this has certain implications, whereas if it's discovered, this has different implications. Thus the agreement is not merely verbal."
545,AskPhilosophy,How could AI be ethical if human ethics changes over time?,"This question is answered in great detail in Nick Bostrom's *Superintelligence*.

There are far too any variables to develop in this comment, but a series of plausible solutions involve creating ways for the AI to learn, and keep learning, its own ethical motivations, instead of having us program them in. 

I strongly suggest you check out Bostrom's book, the question is fascinating and the range of possible solutions (and their potential setbacks) is vast and stimulating.

Edit: I interpreted OP's interest as pertaining to AGI (artificial general intelligence) instead of (the broader category of) AI. Bostrom's book deals with AGI, and I should have been more clear on that."
546,AskPhilosophy,"Why do I feel like Deleuze's ""rhizome"" is stating a very obvious observation?","Every time you have the feeling that a philosopher states the obvious, your first reaction should be charity.

547,AskPhilosophy,Is it coherent to say that God exists outside of time/space?,"> This is a common characteristic attributed to god in theism - that god exists outside of space/time. This allows for wording the cosmological argument in such a way that, while the universe requires a cause, because it begins to exist (according to the big bang theory), god does not require a cause, because god does not 'begin' to exist. 

This formulation of the Cosmological Argument is known as the Kalam Cosmological Argument, and as I understand it is usually regarded as one of the weaker versions of the argument.

I don't know if the following is necessarily better regarded, but here's another way we could formulate it:

1. Much (if not all) of what we observe in the natural world is contingent. [Trees are contingent on acorns, water, and soil; electricity is contingent on the properties of protons and electrons, etc]

2. Contingent things -- I'm handwaving for brevity, ""thing"" is not the ideal word here it just gets the point across -- by definition are dependent on other things. 

3. Contingent things as a class of thing cannot be explained by other contingent things (per 2)

4. There must be at least one thing that's entirely non-contingent.

5. By definition, the non-contingent thing is God.

This formulation of the Cosmological Argument doesn't make any mention specifically of God being outside of space and time, although if space and time are contingent then it would stand to reason that space and time (like other contingent things) are dependent on God.

To anticipate another common complaint, it's also notably not special pleading. We're not just asserting ""everything has a cause, but God doesn't"". We're saying that we know this class of thing exists (contingent thing) that we know requires a non-contingent thing, and since these contingent things exist we know the non-contingent thing has to exist. 

This should be taken with a (massive) grain of salt since I'm not a physicist, but I believe we can compare this sort of reasoning to the reasoning physicists used to postulate the properties of the Higgs-Boson before it was found. We didn't have direct observations of it but we knew that certain things had mass, and that certain other things had to be true in order for things to have mass. When taken together, those observations implied a particle with the properties of the Higgs-Boson, which let us infer it's existence before we'd actually seen it.

That doesn't make the Cosmological Argument automatically right, of course, it is however to show the motivation for taking that line of thought and to show it's not total bupkis, or at least not *prima facie* bupkis.

> The problem I see with that is that I don't even understand the notion of what it would mean to say something exists outside of space and time.

Again, if we're not committed to the Kalam Cosmological argument (which most scholars don't think we should be), what it means is that if that formulation of the Cosmological Argument is true and establishes the existence of God, then time and space have a dependence on God, rather than God having a dependence relation on time and space.

What that means practically -- for instance what God's experience is like compared to ours -- is of course going to be non-trivial to piece together, but I believe that topic is approached in Aquinas's *Summa Theologica*, and I'm sure has been addressed by other theologians and/or philosophers of religion."
548,AskPhilosophy,"When I read Plato, am I reading Plato's ideas or Socrates'?","This is an long-standing question among academics, and has come to be called ""The Socratic Problem"" in the secondary literature.

549,AskPhilosophy,"Where has the conversation around ""simulacra and simulation"" gone in the modern day?","Perhaps surprisingly, Baudrillard gets little attention in Continental philosophy today. Go to the annual SPEP conference (Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy, though they welcome all forms of Continental thought) and you likely won't see a single talk on Baudrillard in the program. It's a shame really, and an opportunity waiting to be seized by a young scholar who wants to earn their chops by bringing Baudrillard back into the conversation.

Part of the problem though is that the linguistic/semiotic turn hasn't been in vogue for awhile. People got sick of not being able to do metaphysics, and of not being able to get beyond representation and signifiers. Derrida's later political writings get more love than his writings on writing, now, while metaphysical thinkers like Deleuze and Irigaray are in ascendancy, Foucault's genealogical analyses of power get way more attention than his archeological works on the historical a priori and the limits of discourse, Kristeva is treated chiefly as a psychoanalyst rather than a semiotician, and phenomenology keeps moving blithely forward as if Heidegger's postphenomenogical critiques of presence just didn't happen. I think it's a bummer that serious philosophical propositions are subject to the rules of fashion just like everything else, but even philosophers can get bored, I guess. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
550,AskPhilosophy,Is mathematics dependent upon the universe we live in or could it exist independently?,"Keep in mind that Russell is using Frege's definition of number, namely that the cardinal numbers can be defined through the use of classes (or sets) without referencing the number itself. As Russell puts it in his 1908 paper 'Mathematical Logic as Based on the Theory of Types':

""The cardinal number of a class α is defined as the class of all classes similar to α, two classes being similar when there is a one-one relation between them.""

So numbers can be defined in terms of *similarity*, and not by recursively referencing the number itself. It's also important to keep in mind that this definition is not widely held by mathematicians today due to the widespread use of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory over Russell's Theory of Types, and ZF set theory does define numbers recursively.

>does this not make his definition of ""number"" something inherently dependent on the world in which we live?

Russell and Frege's definition is reductionist in that it reduces numbers to logical objects, rather than say abstract objects. Both Frege and Russell were major contributors to the movement known as ""logicism"", which you can read more about [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logicism/).

>Up until this point, I thought of mathematics as the abstract study of numbers that could be considered completely separately from the physical world in which we live, and that science, at least part of science, is the process of applying mathematical principles to the real world. However, if the very definition of ""number"" is dependent upon the world in which we live, this view obviously is not logically sound.

The nature of mathematical objects such as numbers is still an open question, and it should be noted that the majority of philosophers are [“Platonists""](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/) rather than [“nominalists""](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nominalism-mathematics/) with regard to abstract objects, which may include numbers (depending on your particular stance). Quine for example was a mathematical Platonist, and [his argument](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathphil-indis/) for that position has been quite influential. Additionally,  Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems cast major doubt on the logicist project, and many have found that a compelling reason to reject mathematical nominalism as well."
551,AskPhilosophy,What is the new kind of thinking Heidegger is talking about?,"I took a class focusing on this aspect of Heidegger's thought. 

This is certainly an area where divergent interpretations make sense.

One interpretation I'm tempted by is that this is kind of like Benjamin's weak messianism in some ways. The new thinking is perpetually ""on the tip of our tongues"", but there's no reason to believe it'll ever happen. The possibility of the new thinking is posited by the relationship between thought and the unthought, and this relationship is perpetual. We should respond to this situation with an attitude of waiting.

Another tempting interpretation is that there are specific claims and moments in the history of philosophy where Heidegger sees thinkers pointing to a way out of ontotheology. The idea is that it is possible to conceive of beings not by freezing a concept of Being, but by privileging temporality in a fundamental way. The time he seems most to be saying this is in a lecture on Plato's *Parmenides* from 1930-31. Francisco Gonzalez's provocative work recently introduced this lecture to Anglophones, if my understanding is correct.
(https://philpapers.org/rec/GONSPB-2 is the paper I'm thinking of.)"

3 is called **deflationism.**  
4 is called **physicalism.**  
5 is called **psychologism or conceptualism.**  
6 is called **fictionalism.**

I will repeat this again below. Here they are:

 &nbsp;

* [This](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nominalism-mathematics/) goes over just nominalism.
* [This](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-mathematics/#OntNat) goes over just naturalism, which is roughly coextensive with physicalism.
* [This](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fictionalism-mathematics/) starts out going over paraphrase nominalism, deflationism, physicalism, psychologism or conceptualism, and platonism, and then goes over fictionalism.
* [This](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/#4.1) goes over physicalism, psychologism, and platonism."
557,AskPhilosophy,"What does Sartre in ""Being and Nothingness"" mean when he says that reducing an existence to its manifestations is not succeeding in overcoming all dualisms but instead converting them into a new dualism of finite and infinite?","There are infinite ways in which something can manifest itself within consciousness, but it can only be experienced one mode or way at a time. An egg is the source of an infinite number of experiences, but it can only give me one side of itself at a time."
558,AskPhilosophy,Why do people have a problem with moral relativism?,"This point is often missed, but it should be noted that a lack of objective morality (at least in the sense in which we typically think of objectivity) does not entail moral relativism (or moral nihilism). The existence of moral properties in the world, or \[mind-independent\] moral facts, etc., is not the only way to establish some form of moral realism. Christine Korsgaard gives an excellent discussion of this in her book *The Sources of Normativity.* As a neoKantian, she advocates for what she calls a kind of procedural realism (as distinct from 'substantive realism' which is the position that moral statements are true because of intrinsic moral values in the world, \[mind-independent\] moral facts, moral properties, etc.) The procedural realist thinks that moral questions can have correct answers, but these answers aren't due to the existence of \[mind-independent\] moral facts.

Secondly, moral relativism would be a weird choice for people who are skeptical about whether things really are right or wrong. Moral relativism holds that some things *are* moral or immoral, but it's just that whether they are moral or immoral depends upon what an individual or culture thinks. The more obvious alternative would be moral nihilism or moral error theory.

One reason, I think, that moral nihilism and error theory aren't more popular is because it is hard to live according to them. They don't seem mesh well with our lives. Another, more theoretical reason why moral nihilism and error theory aren't more popular is because the arguments made against moral facts and properties, it turns out, can be made against other sorts of normativity too. Rationality and epistemology are also normative. But any argument against these norms risk being self-undermining, since they undermine the normative force behind accepting reasons to believe things. Some philosophers, such as Bart Streumer (in his book *Unbelievable Errors*) bite the bullet and accept this conclusion, but it's one that many see reason to resist.

This is not a comprehensive answer by any means, and feel free to ask for clarification if I used too much jargon, but that's my best guess at an answer."
559,AskPhilosophy,What was (philosophically) novel in the New Testament?," So, I’m a huge fan of Biblical philosophy and as such am really glad for this question!

Now, I don’t know much about the psychology side, so I’ll be focusing on philosophy strictly. Further, thinking through the novelness of an idea is a bit difficult, is it novel compared to the surrounding area? (Yes), is it historically novel? Yes. But I also don’t know much about Eastern philosophy, or how these terms may relate to others, so I’m just laying out some of the radical thought that makes a radical change.

A few things to point out: the New Testament can’t quite stand alone separate from the Old Testament, even though a lot of what Jesus says seems to contradict the Old Testament (for example, performing miracles on the Sabbath), his role can be considered as the midrashim, an interpreter of the text, and as such all that he says is rooted in the Law. So! I recommend reading some Old Testament in conjunction – primarily Genesis, Exodus, and Deuteronomy. 

So, for some “novel” concepts in the Bible, you’re right on about the concept of love, yet love stands as a very complex formulation, separate from concepts of love that you find in Plato for example. This love is distinct from power, and rooted in the absurd (turn the other cheek \[pretty radical idea\], love your neighbour as yourself). For further reading on Biblical love check out Kierkegaard’s *Works of Love*. Kind of similar in style to *The Gay Science*, and hard to parse through, but a nice slow read would be fruitful!. 

Further, thinking of love (and it’s relation to reason – hello 1 Corinthians!) philosophical metaphysics (and in relation ethics) is transformed. Hegel writes on this excellently in *Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion*. Here we see love and faith coming together, paired with the framework of reason (again in contradistinction to the Greeks). 

Some classic stuff you can look into also include the ascetic, the slave/master morality, all of which stem from Biblical thought; Nietzsche stands as the core here: *Genealogy of Morals,* and some aphorisms in *The Gay Science* delve into these new moral structures.  

A really cool expansion on biblical thought can be found in Badiou’s *Saint Paul: The Foundation of Universalism.* In this book he makes the claim that Saint Paul is the figure for something called “single universalism” – where the individual in their subjectivity creates the foundations of the objective (connections to Kant can be seen here). It’s an amazing book I recommend. 

On the same stream, thinking through sin and forgiveness, we can find the idea of reaching heaven – Luke 17:21. Now this is a bit more controversial, but it’s distinction to Plato, and it’s novelness stands in the proposition that heaven (in other word the form maybe? Not a direct parallel of course) can be reached – and here’s the controversy – on Earth, in community. This idea is further pushed by Kant in the *Grounding* (kingdom of ends), Levinas (the face of the other), Buber (*I and Thou*). 

One last one would be the use of paradox and metaphor. This one might be more abstract, and I am not saying that other texts in the time period did not have this (I don’t know enough to say that). What I am saying is that this is a radical philosophical intervention that stems directly from Biblical ethics. This one is a bit harder to explain but check out “Odysseus’ Scar in Auerbach’s *Mimesis* (he makes a comparison between ancient Greek narrative and Biblical narrative, it’s excellent). In short, what we find in the biblical is metaphor and interpretation (hence where paradox comes in), more ambiguity. This can be mostly seen in Saint Paul’s letters (to the Corinthians, stuff like use the foolish things to shame the wise …) and Jesus’ sayings (“why do you ask me what’s good?”). I might not have articulated this one too well but check out Auerbach, Derrida (his work on radical evil), and Hagglund as well for something more contemporary.  

So I hope this shows some of the novel-ness of the New Testament and isn’t too abstract!"

When we get a desire for a burger or even enjoy a 'real' one, the cause of desire and pleasure isn't the physical burger (some people seem to think that Baudrillard is denying the existence of this physical burger - his theory of hyperreality clearly isn't ontological or even pointing to a 'Matrix' scenario but posing a theory of semiotics, pointing out the problematic nature of how we represent the world through signs and language) but the burger from the commercials that is juicier, meatier, fresher, more vibrant, more colourful, more tasty than any real world burger ever could be. For Baudrillard, this is how US consumer culture run by the fantasy of marketing and advertising functions on a very banal, everyday level. It's just that Disneyland very explicitely *tells you* that it is a fantasy whereas a burger and all the other everyday things in our lives appear as real - but they are in fact hyperreal, built on layers of signification that have made the much less exciting real-real redundant.

The fantasy has infested whatever traces of real there were. This is Baudrillard's main point - going against the classic theory of Ideology where there is a 'real-real' hidden behind the fantasy - in our world nothing represents the real but everything represents prior layers of representation. Disneyland is a great example because it's modelled after European *fairytales* that have continously evolved - mutated away from whatever reality there may have been - over hundreds of years. At it's very basic foundation, Disneyland is already many steps removed from reality - there is no way Disneyland could *possibly* represent the real. We cannot peel through them because every trace of 'reality' (actual mediaval Europe for example, we cannot go into a real world castle *without* experiencing it through prior hyperreality) is already represented through prior layers (fairytales). I think somewhere Baudrillard makes the point that this isn't a process that started with the advent of advertising but - looking at fairytales and mythology - is perhaps inherent to culture. We lost the real somewhere along the way in endless layers of cultural signifiers. We don't really know exactly when or how it happened - in a sense Baudrillard is just making an retroactive observation of something that was set into process a long time ago."
562,AskPhilosophy,What's the deal with Nietzsche and women?,"> So, what's going on here? Is this guy just confused about women?

There is a lot to say about individual passages, but with Nietzsche especially we run into a really tough problem of exegesis (we see a similar problem in reading, say, Beauvoir's *Second Sex*).  Sometimes Nietzsche is talking about women as a type - in this case he's just talking about the socio-cultural construction of women qua women.  He does this with nationalities too - like when he talks about ""Germans"" or ""The English"" or whatever.  This means it's not always immediately clear if he's actually saying something about women *qua* persons or he's just talking about women *qua* women.

So period-expected sexism + sometimes referring to all people by way of terms like ""men"" + sometimes doing genealogical criticism of the sexes = a very confusing situation for the reader."
563,AskPhilosophy,"Are/were there any ""anti-reason"" and ""anti-logic"" philosophers?","I don't think its quite what you're looking for but:

Adorno and Horkheimer in *Dialectic of Enlightenment* don't say that logic and reason are *wrong*, but believe that reason/logic as a worldview brought to hegemonic status by the Enlightenment is responsible for the reduction of life to formal and operational processes and enables domination both of nature by humans, as well as the domination of humans by other humans.

Thomas Docherty also uses Gottlob Frege's discussion of 1+1=2 to suggest that mathematics, in order to allow 1+1 =2, has to strip the '1' of its content and reduce it to a pure formal logic; and that pure formal logic, applied to political structures like democracy where it is believed that simply adding votes or viewpoints together creates something greater, is a mistake.

Edit: If anyone is interested in the Docherty piece it's in his book ""Confessions: The Philosophy of Transparency"", Chapter 6 onwards from the subheading ""Of persuasion and the confessional ground of judgement""."
564,AskPhilosophy,Is math actually related to science?,"Anecdotally I can say from prior conversations that most or all of the other mathematicians in my department do not consider math to be in any way an empirical disclipline, though whether or not they call it a science is going to depend on splitting hairs about how you define ""science"". I personally take the pragmatic view that thinking about math as remotely similar to science is incredibly misleading to laypeople and so we should make a distinction between the two.

As to the issue of whether math is discovered or created by man, well that's going to lead to a lot of splitting hairs about what you mean by ""discovered"" and ""created"". I'm not even going to attempt to speak for other mathematicians here, but my personal opinion on the existence of mathematical objects is that they exist but only in an abstract sense of the word as structural relationships between ideas and objects, and that math is not ""man made"" except in the sense that the manner in which we interpret these structural relationships is colored by our psychological limitations and biases.

But honestly, the truth is that in general most working mathematicians are mostly unconcerned with all this.

Edit: to be clear, I am not a philosopher and don't know the current state of philosophical research in this area. Just thought it would be interesting to get a mathematician's perspective."
565,AskPhilosophy,Are there major advancements in Philosophy these days like how there are in Science?,"One of my former professors said something to the effect of philosophy being historically a midwife to the sciences. So if you think about it in terms of sciences that have philosophical origins, you can classify that as advancement.

Another one of my former professors said something to the effect of there being ""trends"" in philosophy. Certain views that are popular until they fall out of fashion essentially. One such example was logical positivism, which was big for a long time until it fell out of fashion.

One philosophical field where there's advancement is in logic. Sometimes logic is claimed under the branch of mathematics though. Some famous logicians had strong math backgrounds (Frege and Leibniz off the top of my head.)

Another field that may fall into this is something like medical ethics, which is routinely taught to doctors by philosophers. But this isn't something I'm familiar with.

Lastly, as the world advances, so does the philosophy associated with it. We didn't use to have a philosophy of artificial intelligence because it didn't exist for example. Or things like ethics associated with machines. Stuff like that."

567,AskPhilosophy,Are there any good arguments against veganism?,"There are three main prongs of argument against ethical veganism (and vegetarianism) that I'm aware of. I'll present them here alongside vegan replies. Spoiler alert: I don't really think there are any good moral arguments for eating meat and you will see that reflected in my comments below.

1) Animals aren't moral patients. In other words, nothing that you do to animals matters morally because they aren't sentient, or have whatever quality it is that creates a moral distinction between animals and humans.

*Reply*: From the start, it's always difficult for the ethical omnivore to articulate exactly what it is that animals lack and humans have. It can't be pain, since animals very clearly feel pain. If it's a more sophisticated concept like self-awareness, then there are going to be below-average humans who lack it and above-average animals who have it. Yet ethical omnivores would be loath to admit that eating some mentally disabled humans is permissible.

2) I'm just one person in a huge system of consumption. The animals are going to be slaughtered regardless of whether or not I personally choose to eat meat, so I might as well eat meat.

*Reply*: It's true that your decision to stop eating meat will not single-handedly bring the whole industry to a halt. However, if you and 9,999 other people stop eating meat, that will have a meaningful effect on the industry. The movement is more likely to reach that kind of critical mass if you abstain from meat than if you do not, so you should contribute by becoming a vegan or vegetarian. 

In addition, your decision to abstain does not occur in a vacuum. I think it's reasonable to believe that your decision to change your diet will influence other people, who will in turn influence others. If this is true, then you have the ability to affect the factory farming industry beyond just your own consumption habits.

3) I get that it's bad to treat animals in the ways that we do, but I think meat is really tasty and it's too demanding to ask me to change my lifestyle and become a vegan.

*Reply*: There's a version of this argument that is fair, I think. For example, if you live in the polar regions and the only way for you to survive is to hunt and eat seals, then I think it's permissible for you to do so. However, this is simply not the case for the vast majority of people living in the developed world. The demands of morality that you eat a goddamn vegetable for once are not so awful that they outweigh the horror wrought upon the animals you consume."
568,AskPhilosophy,I'm a high school student. In a week or two I'm gonna give a short presentation on the philosophy of mathematics. What are some critical things I should talk about?,"It might be more productive to focus on one point, and bring that across as well as you can. For example, you might 

- Talk about platonism vs. nominalism about mathematical entities

- The history of the foundations of math - especially Hilbert's program of finding universal axioms of math - and how Gödel's incompleteness theorems showed that to be impossible

I worry that if you say you want to give a short presentation, you're gonna only superficially treat five questions rather than give a good, solid overview of one."
569,AskPhilosophy,How do I get better at having philosophical discussions?,"Modify your ratio of questions to statements.

If you do not understand your interlocutor, then ask clarifying questions.  Try restating what they said in different ways.  You can adopt [Dennett's rules for Criticism](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/03/28/daniel-dennett-rapoport-rules-criticism/) as general guidelines for conversation:

* You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.

* You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).

* You should mention anything you have learned from your target.

* Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.

Try to understand your interlocutor through questions and restatements, rather than articulating your own position.

This will also make folks more inclined to talk to you.  People, in general, like talking about their own beliefs to someone who seems interested.  People generally do not want to listen to someone else pontificate beliefs."
570,AskPhilosophy,"Is Stoicism a form of what Nietzsche describes as ""slave morality""?","I might be wrong about this, but I believe that Nietzsche sees classical Stoicism as a form of asceticism, not a form of slave morality.

Later forms of Stoicism, which were absorbed into Christianity (and therefore inherited the Jewish foundations of Christianity), would probably qualify, however."

572,AskPhilosophy,In what sense are Foucault and Deleuze ‘anti-phenomenologists’?,"I can't speak for Foucault but Deleuzes relationship with phemenology is ....  extremely complicated, to say the least. I've had discussions about this with a friend of mine who is an ardent phenomenologist and it's really, really hard to get to any definite answers here; even the professional scholarship is still in the process of trying to figure this out. For a long time, (back when Deleuze scholarship was almost exclusively undertaken in literature and cultural studies etc. departments) Deleuze *was* considered as a sort of die hard anti-subject, anti-phenomenologist thinker but consequent readings of his theoretical philosophy have gotten much more differentiated (heh) in the last fifteen years or so, which has made the reading of him as purely opposed to phenomenology rather untenable (just how reading him as ""anti-psychoanalysis"" is now more and more considered a rather gross simplification). Take for example, one of the core concepts in Deleuzes philosophy that supposedly ""undermines"" phenomenology: the *transcendental field*, which is taken from Sartre who got the idea from... that's right, *Husserl*. Another example would be Deleuzes critique of phenomenology in *Logic Of Sensation*, which is largely based of a reading of Henri Maldiney who is ... a phenomenologist. So perhaps Deleuze could be more accurately called a ""post-phenomenologist"". 

All that said, I think some of the passages in LoS are pretty instructive to get a basic idea of the ""problematic field"" that Deleuze encounters in phenomenology. Take for example this passage:

>This ground, this rhythmic unity of the senses, can be discovered only by going beyond the organism. The
phenomenological hypothesis is perhaps insufficient because it merely invokes the lived body. But the lived
body is still a paltry thing in comparison with a more profound and almost unlivable Power [Puissance]. We can
seek the unity of rhythm only at the point where rhythm itself plunges into chaos, into the night, at the point
where the differences of level are perpetually and violently mixed. (*Logic Of Sensation*, p. 44).

The basic premise here seems to be that Deleuze, from the very start of his career (c.f. the *""What is Grounding?""* lectures from the 50s) really is interested in the question of grounding (*fonder*, *Grund* in German, c.f. German idealism & romanticism) and for a variety of reasons, for him both intentional consciousness and the body/Leib are not sufficient grounds; there ought to be an ""even deeper"" ""pre-subjective"", ""pre-reflexive"" ground that forms the sufficient reason (Jeffry Bell has done some great work on Deleuze's commitment to the PSR in his guide to *What Is Philosophy*) for both intentional consciousness and the body. Like I said above, this is an idea that Deleuze develops by building on Sartre, who was radicalizing certain aspects of the late Husserl who already was understanding consciousness more and more as a kind of ""field"".

If you want to read more on this topic (because it really is a rabbithole), I would recommend on top off my head (among others) the work of Corry Shores, who has probably done the most work on Deleuze/phenomenology; Ronald Brogue on Henri Maldiney; Alain Beaulieu on Deleuze/Husserl and Daniela Voss on Deleuze/Husserl & Deleuze/Merleau-Ponty."
573,AskPhilosophy,"Is there any good philosophy about the idea that sexuality is more omnipresent than we realize, and that most, or at least many more everyday things than we realize have an element of being sexual?","George Bataille and the collaborative work of Gilles Deleuze and Fèlix Guattari both write at great length about the pervasiveness of desire/libidinal energy, though that isn’t quite the same thing. *Anti-Oedipus* might be worth looking into.

574,AskPhilosophy,How can get better at reading philosophical literature? Is it always difficult at first?,"Much of continental philosophy is difficult to understand, and particularly difficult if you aren't familiar with the earlier works that informed them. Does it get easier? I would say yes. It gets easier when you have read and understood a lot of the foundational texts. Of course, some of those texts (e.g. Hegel) are extremely difficult in themselves, and you may want to read a guide to the text rather than digging in directly at first.

I would also point out that philosophical literature is very diverse and there are certainly easier texts to start with. I usually recommend dialogues (Plato's, Berkeley's) as a good starting point. Personally I also think Foucault isn't terribly difficult as far as continental philosophers go.

If you are set on reading the original texts (rather than secondary texts), you may want to start with an anthology that presents the texts in a reasonable order and usually provides introductory sections before each text."
575,AskPhilosophy,Is it actually (not technically possible ) to study philosophy without a university education?,"It depends on the aim of your study. If you want to study philosophy to a level where your philosophical expertise will be enough to publish peer-reviewed articles in respected journals, then it's unlikely that you'll succeed without formal training. But given enough time and dedication, you can come to know quite a lot about philosophy, and I think the level of knowledge you'll have with a minor in philosophy can be achieved on your own as well if you approach your study well."
576,AskPhilosophy,What are cases in the last 200 years whereby a total outsider to academic philosophy has contributed something of great value to philosophy?,"
Two of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century did not begin their studies in philosophy. Edmund Husserl was a mathematician who became interested in philosophical problems related to the foundations of logic and mathematics. He went on to found phenomenology, one of the most influential philosophical movements of the 20th century. 

Wittgenstein, likewise, began his studies as an engineer and also became interested in philosophy because of these issues in the foundations of mathematics and logic.

Martin Heidegger, likewise, began as a theology student before turning to philosophy. 

In the early 20th century, Germany didn’t divide their faculties, meaning that all sciences were done in the philosophy department. This usually resulted in a more flexible vocational path.

Another notable example would be Lenin, who entered into the sphere of philosophy from out of his experience as a political revolutionary, yet went on not only to write some of the most important pieces of Marxist philosophy, but also to engage extensively with philosophy of science. Lenin wrote an important critique of Ernst Mach and some of the forerunners to logical positivism, a materialist critique of empiricism that heavily influences Althusser’s philosophy of science and subsequent materialist approaches."

586,AskPhilosophy,How would Stoicism and other secular philosophy's that are against hedonism deal with a Brave New World scenario where hedonism (drugs) could provide not only sensual comforts but a sense of transcendent meaning?,"I don't think that the use of pleasure inducing drugs would be incompatible with a Stoic lifestyle. Let me give a little background to explain why (apologies if you already know some of this)...

Stoicisim is incompatible with hedonism because the two philosophies have very different views about what has intrinsic value. For the hedonist, pleasure is the only intrinsically valuable thing, and the more pleasure you have, the more you are flourishing. For the Stoic, virtue is the only intrinsically valuable thing, and you will flourish so long as you are virtuous, that is, so long as you exercise your capacities for reason in the proper way.

I emphasize this because, **for the Stoic,** **pleasure is not intrinsically good as it is for the hedonist,** **but it isn't intrinsically bad either.** The Stoic is free to have pleasant experiences. What they are not free to do is to become attached to the pursuit of pleasure to the point where they think they will not flourish if they do not have pleasant experiences. For the Stoic that would demonstrate irrationality--the very grave irrationality of staking your well being on something  beyond your control--and that would be an impediment to your flourishing by the Stoic's lights. 

To draw an analogy, the Stoic can freely pursue relationships with other people or have children, he just cannot get attached to these relationships to the point that he will grieve if he loses the partner or child, because then he is staking his wellbeing on something beyond his control. Similarly, the Stoic can have or even pursue pleasurable experiences, including drug induced pleasurable experiences, presumably, so long as he does not make the mistake of seeing those experiences as intrinscially valuable the way the hedonist does.

If the drugs not only produced pleasant experiences but also disrupted your capacity to exercise reason and display virtue, that would be a different story..."
587,AskPhilosophy,Is there a website that acts as a dictionary of philosophical terms between languages?,"That´s the job translators supposed to make. And it is tough.

588,AskPhilosophy,Can someone explain how consciousness isn't a byproduct of brain activity?,"Well.. it's not per se the case that consciousness isn't the byproduct of brain activity, it's just so that we can't prove it is. 

Maybe this becomes clearer when you look at what philosophers call: ""the hard problem (of consciousness)"". This is the question of why we have experiences at all. It seems strange that adding pieces of matter together, which alone don't seem to be conscious, seems to generate consciousness. It's like putting a lot of marbles together and then expecting consciousness to arise. That would just seem weird.

We know that we are conscious and we know that brain processes influence our consciousness (our thoughts, feelings, etc.) and that hormones have a role in emotion. We can't however equal brain processes with consciousness nor can we equal hormones with emotions. Putting hormones into a glass doesn't mean there's feelings in a glass and simulating brain states in a computer doesn't mean that computer is conscious. There seems to be something over and above that which we can't quite grasp. Something primary. 

Now the mind-body problem is not about explaining which hormones and which brain states effect consciousness in what way. It's about explaining how consciousness and matter can interact. Take Descartes substance dualism. Descartes posited that matter is an extended substance whilst mind is an unextended substance. The question then arises how the two can interact. How is the mind connected to the body for instance if it is not extended? Is it situated in a part of the body, or in the whole body? If it is situated in just a part of the body, how can we have conscious awarenss in the rest of the body? And if it is situated in the whole, doesn't that mean that the mind is extended? Such questions are of importance for the mind-body problem.

Hope that helps."
589,AskPhilosophy,Why doesn't philosophy discuss how to live a good life like Ancient Philosophy did?,"In continental circles, getting back to questions about living a good life has been an on-going project for ages.

590,AskPhilosophy,Did Lenin misread this one line from Engels in State and Revolution?,"Lenin has a different conception of the state than Marx. In chapter 5 of S&R, Lenin writes (speaking of the first stage of communism):

and later writes:

> But the state has not yet completely withered away, since the still remains the safeguarding of ""bourgeois law"",

Lenin argues that because the first stage of communism (which has no classes) still has bougeois law, that is proof of the existence of a state, one that safeguards bourgeois law.

 Marx mentioned something similar about how the ""defects"" of capitalism will still exist under the first stage of communism, but rejects that the state will exist. Lenin argues the state will persist, even after the abolition of classes. This is not the typical Marxist idea of the state. I hope someone else can chime in."
591,AskPhilosophy,What Is Logic and What Is It's Relation With Reality?,"Logic isn't actually about expressing the world.

In logic there's a distinction between validity and soundness.
Validity being the way to describe an argument where the conclusion naturally follows the premises. However, validity doesn't speak to the truth of the premises and the conclusions.

For example:

1. All redditors will upvote this post
2. I am a redditor
3. Therefore I will upvote this post.

3 naturally follows from 1 and 2 so it is a valid logical argument. However, it is not true because I just downvoted this post. That means that premise 1 is false in my argument.

""Soundness"" is how we describe a logically valid argument that ALSO  has premises that are true.


Another way to look at your question is through Hume's distinction between ""Relations of Ideas"" and ""Matters of Fact.""
Relations of ideas being the types of things we can logically deduce that do not require us to have any knowledge of the world.
Matters of Fact being things we can only know through experience in the world.

The former allows us to have 100% certainty because of the necessity of logical conclusions, the latter being more fallible since we can't arrive at logically necessary conclusions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume%27s_fork"

Things like ""substance"" were just ways of discussing things that exist, and even today there are people who defend the Aristotelian metaphysics from which all this language comes from. The modern ""scientific"" point of view that you're taking from granted was actually something that slowly developed from the work of these very philosophers. There is no way that we have Kant without Descartes and Spinoza.

There's nothing unscientific about it. You're just looking at the people who built the world that you live in from the point of view of already living in it instead of building it."

596,AskPhilosophy,Why is Kantian Ethics so important if it’s impractical?,"A lot of contemporary Kantian ethicists think the axe murderer at the door is not a problem.

The short-summary is that she says there is a different set of rules when dealing with evil people, because you would not want to make yourself a “tool of evil”. As far as I know, there is no contemporary Kantian moral philosophers that think you should tell the axe murderer where your friend is hiding. 

The Kantian scholar does not have to agree with everything Kant said(he says things about animals, women and races), that Kantians disagree with. They reformulate Kant’s theory or point out Kant “misunderstood”(I use this word cautiously) the implications of his own theory. This is not to say there are *no* problems with Kantian moral philosophy, but a lot of the more obvious problems, such as the axe murderer or how to reconcile Kant’s views on animals and women have been addressed already."

And if X has received some amount of attention in philosophy it's a significant one.

If you look at the often cited philpapers study, you can find a couple of positions which the editors deemed significant enough to list as an option but have less than 5% support, so presumably >95% would answer ""no"" to ""is X true?"".That would include skepticism about the external world (4.8%), idealism about the external world (4.3%), relativism about knowledge claims (2.9%), and something called sense-datum theory about perceptual experience (3.1%)."
598,AskPhilosophy,What are some of the 'fault lines' in Nietzsche scholarship? What do Nietzsche scholars tend to disagree on?,"Honestly, with Nietzsche, if you search long enough, you can find passages that support or deny almost any position or reading.

So, just as an example, Nietzsche's views on democracy are, to put it mildly, extremly contentious. There is a, largely American, segment of Nietzsche scholarship that points to Nietzsche's well documented admiration for Emerson and tries to read a pro-democracy Nietzsche in line with Habermas and Rawls. Then there is a, largely French and German, leftist tradition that reads Nietzsche as an explosive anti-state thinker that diagnoses the antinomies of bourgeois modernity and is incompatible with democratic statist liberalism. And then there is a  reading (sometimes by actual reactionaries, sometimes by scholars that just think that this is the correct interpretation) of Nietzsche that takes the often aristocratic and anti-democratic flavor of his work literally. Ultimately, for each reading, there are passages that support it and others that don't, so which one is the most accuracte, I don't know, the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle."
599,AskPhilosophy,"Can someone help explain why Marxists and other socialists think that wage labor is immoral? Also, is that the primary reason they reject capitalism, or are there other very important reasons?","Marx's argument is not that wage labor is ""immoral."" He argues that the mechanisms of capital reproduction requires the capitalist to pay you less than what you actually produce in order to make a profit - the theory of surplus value. Marx is attempting to show how the liberal principles of free trade actually undermine themselves because of the disconnect between use-value (the actual embodied commodity) and exchange-value (pretty much the commodities price). The argument is that labor power is a special commodity because it produces more value than it costs (a worker ""costs"" what it takes to keep him alive and working, so a worker may require only five labor hours worth of bread to do ten hours of labor himself). That difference is the surplus value, which the capitalist keeps for himself, even though the worker received the ""value"" of their labor - which is just enough to survive.   


On a more fundamental level, capitalism *requires* the existence of a substantial portion of the population who have absolutely no way to feed themselves other than to sell their labor at market. At the same time capital breaks feudalism and lifts the peasant out of poverty, it shackles him to itself and keeps him dependent, a virtual serf with invisible chains. Actually, the American founders make an argument relying on similar logic to defend the property requirement for voting - how could someone who is not independent financially, who cannot grow his own food but has to depend on someone else, vote freely? Marx makes the same observation, but his logic is to ensure every man has land - that is, access to the means of production, which capital monopolizes.   


The contradiction between capital and labor is probably the fundamental one that Marx stresses, but there are plenty of others: its tendency to difficult-to-explain booms and busts, its pathological need for growth, and its relationship with imperialism. It's not about morality, in fact he criticizes socialists and anarchists who appeal to ahistorical and eternal concepts of justice, morality, or rights. Capitalism is bad because it cannot sustain itself, and it must eventually collapse. Marx thought it would collapse and give way to socialist revolution: I think now it's more obvious that it will collapse in massive political failure and climate catastrophe because we have no way to regulate consumption.   


If you're curious about actually understanding Marx's arguments, which are mostly economic rather than political and  pretty insightful/thought-provoking even if you disagree with him, read Vol 1 of Capital and Harvey's Companion to it. You don't really need to read all of it, but find out about his ideas about surplus value, surplus labor population, and the process of capital accumulation. His accounts of the working day and of machinery (each gets its own chapter) are  easy to read and understand. Chapter 1-3 are probably the hardest, Chapter 4 starts the working day and is where he recommended actual workers start reading. I highly recommend the Penguin edition because of its intros and footnote placement on the page but you can always find Marx's stuff online for free. "
600,AskPhilosophy,If ones belief in God is based off of Pascal’s Wager does that invalidate their belief?,"Pascal's wager is often criticized this way. But that critique misunderstands what Pascal is actually trying to do.

Let's start by summarizing the wager. We generally summarize it this way: Either God is, or God is not: 

* If God is and we bet that God is not, then we lose everything. 
* If God is and we bet that God is, then we gain everything. 
* If God is not and we bet that God is not, then we lose nothing (and gain nothing).
* If God is not and we bet that God is, then we also lose nothing (and gain nothing).

So, says Pascal, it makes the most sense to bet that God is and then go from there. At best, we gain everything; at worst we lose nothing. But, if we were to bet that God is not, then at best we would gain or lose nothing; at worst we would lose everything.

But then Pascal goes on. He speaks for his fictional conversation partner, ""Yes, but I have my hands tied and my mouth closed; I am forced to wager, and am not free. I am not released, and am so made that I cannot believe. What then would you have me.""

And then Pascal suggests that if someone wants to believe, then they shouldn't be piling up proofs for God. Instead, they should fake-it-til-they-make-it:

>You would like to attain faith, and do not know the way; you would like to cure yourself of unbelief, and ask the remedy for it. Learn of those who have been bound like you, and who now stake all their possessions. These are people who know the way which you would follow, and who are cured of an ill of which you would be cured. Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believe, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your acuteness.

What's more, Pascal makes an argument similar to the wager: 

>Now what harm will befall you in taking this side? You will be faithful, honest, humble, grateful, generous, a sincere friend, truthful. Certainly you will not have those poisonous pleasures, glory and luxury; but will you not have others? I will tell you that you will thereby gain in this life, and that, at each step you take on this road, you will see so great certainty of gain, so much nothingness in what you risk, that you will at last recognize that you have wagered for something certain and infinite, for which you have given nothing.

In other words, act like you believe (actually live like a believer) and you will come to believe. And even if you're wrong in your belief (that is, even if God is not), you will still be a better person. There is the opportunity for so much gain and not much loss.

Now, a final point, Pascal is **not** trying to reason anyone into believing that God exists, that some version of Christianity is factually true, etc.:

>Who then will blame Christians for not being able to give a reason for their belief, since they profess a religion for which they cannot give a reason? They declare, in expounding it to the world, that it is a foolishness, stultitiam; and then you complain that they do not prove it!

For Pascal, Christianity is not **rational**, it is **practical**. One comes to faith through the practice. The wager is just there to get the reader to try the practice and come to faith. Bet that God is, start doing the things (even if you don't believe), and eventually come to faith through the doing."

602,AskPhilosophy,"Is there a philosopher that talks about relief as a source of pleasure, or how suffering can sometimes amplify pleasure?","Epicurus, in a few places, describes pleasure as the overcoming of pain and thus prescribes the life of pleasure as really being a life in which we avoid as much pain as possible."
603,AskPhilosophy,How do I deal with people who refuse to acknowledge their existing notions of morality?,"His argument was that a moral theory needs to be ‘grounded’ in something commonly accepted. Rape and murder are fairly common grounding principles (within the context of in-group it is a universal). If your moral theory has no ground to stand on, it is likely more of an entertaining distraction or excuse generator.  (“Likely” is the key word here. Grounding might not be necessary whatsoever, but that would be the position you are up against).

> but rather that we *should* support a utilitarian system based...  

By saying “*should*” in this sentence, you’ve done exactly what you’re complaining about. By stating that there is a “should” or “ought”, you’ve already conceded that there is some standard of moral valuations, and then circularly reason back to utilitarian rationale to justify utilizing utilitarian ethics.   

I think the way to deal with the problem you’re facing is to simply make the interaction more of a conversation and less focus on winning them over. Be genuinely curious about their beliefs, or else you’ll just be building a straw man."
604,AskPhilosophy,"When Foucault was writing on ancient Greek sexual ethics in the Use of Pleasure, did he do an accurate retelling of how the ancient Greeks thought about sexuality? Has Foucault been criticized by scholars of ancient Greece?",This might be a really good question for /r/askhistorians
605,AskPhilosophy,"What are the criteria one must meet in order to be considered a ""Marxist""?","This is a very contentious field, partly because of the popularisation of 'postmodern neo-marxism' by shills like Peterson, but also because of the absolute state of the post-1945 and post-1989 communist left, who all love to say they're the real Marxists and other traditions are bunk. To keep this short [edit: it was not short, I apologise] I'll try stick to academic/theoretical Marxism, but as someone who is a traumatised ex-Leninist, trust me when I say the animus and dissension runs far deeper than this lol.

Basically, depending on who you ask, there will be different criteria for what constitutes a Marxist. 

-- For many it is adherence to the method and doctrine of dialectical materialism that defines a Marxist; theorists like Althusser conceive of Marxism as a 'science' which is clarified by the method of dialectical materialism. This notion was popular amongst the milieu surrounding the communist and existentialist-left in France and the institutionalised Stalinist parties in Western Europe. Essentially the idea is that one must subscribe to the Marxist idea of history as being formed by class struggle, and this struggle being situated in a dialectical relationship. Notably, however, Althusser did away with the inevitability of revolution in Marx and also used dialectics in very interesting ways to produce new accounts of Ideology, so this criteria has elements of both doctrine and method. In this definition I would also include broadly the Frankfurt school--thinkers like Adorno, Horkheimer, Benjamin and their offshoots in thinkers like Jameson--people who centre dialectics as the fundamental metaphor of their thought. Notably each thinker is remarkably unique in many ways, showing dialectical materialism to be more method than doctrine when used correctly.

-- For some theorists like David Harvey, Andrew Kliman, it is adherence to Marxist political economy, which centres the role of class in all social relationships, that define their Marxism. Dialectical materialism plays a role, but it's arguable that for these more social-science oriented thinkers it's a close reading of capital, and an active interpretation of key Marxist concepts like the Labour Theory of Value and the Law of the Tendency of the Rae of the Profit to Fall (LTRPF for short) which 'grounds' each thinkers' respective Marxist theory. It should be noted that Harvey and Kliman actually have fundamentally different interpretations of Marxist Political economy, but I would like to think both would consider the other one a Marxist.  

Once you get into the intellectual milieu of the post-1968s New Left, things get a little trickier and you observe a split between orthodox Marxists and so-called 'post-' or 'neo-' Marxists, the latter of whom believe that the *spirit* of Marxism requires that his key assumptions must be over-ridden to account for the exigencies of a changing world. 

These post/neo-marxists include: 

+ Stuart Hall, who recentred the role of culture in ideology through a reading of Gramsci and a bastardisation of Althusser--he claimed that class, while central, played an 'overdetermining role', meaning it was one of several sufficient processes structuring social relations; 

+ Theorists like Hardt & Negri who take their cues from Italian autonomism--they believe that Marxism must recentre the role of the worker and take its ideological cues from the working class rather than academics in order to ensure that hierarchies are avoided when building class power. Alongside this, they claim in the 21st century that class relations are fundamentally being altered by neoliberal capitalism such that we are entering a new 'phase' of capitalist production/resistance/struggle. Autonomists are often derided as abandoning the centrality of political economy and class in favour of pursuing 'populism', although there are later theorists like Nick Dyer-Witherford who (IMO) try to recentre hard nosed political economic work into Autonomist Marxism; 

+ Then there's the theorists who use Marx to move to the *right* or at least towards a re-conceived 'new orthodoxy' which is less revisionist but can skew towards social democratic ideas. People like GA Cohen, Chantal Mouffe & Ernesto Laclau (and also the 'analytical' Marxists like John Elster, and the more radical Ellen Meiksins Wood). Their projects are pretty diffuse but if you're looking for some trenchant critiques of Marx that aren't trying to drag him 'leftwards' necessarily they'll be a good constellation to start. 

+ FINALLY, there are the postmodern Marxists (yes, they exist but not in *that* way). Foucault was once quoted saying (paraphrased): 'physicists do not quote Einstein when using his theories so I do not quote Marx when using his; people presume I am not a Marxist because I don't bother to cite him and instead use his ideas'. These thinkers, broadly, can be considered as serious breaks from Marx which still refer to, complicate and bounce off some of his key concepts. These theorists, more than any others, embody Marx's quote that Marxism is truly about 'the merciless critique of all that exists'. In this vein, they tend to do away with all of the hallmarks of Marxism, preserving very little that is recognisably Marxist, while still deploying his theories as partial foundations for their work.  
-- For instance: Baudrillard abandons Marxist political economy, claiming there is no 'base', only 'superstructure' now--and yet at the same time his theory of hyper-reality depends on the Marxist distinction between use/exchange value; Derrida, Foucault and Deleuze all distance themselves from dialectical materialism--with Deleuze attempting to abandon dialectical thinking altogether, and yet each thinker, being left wing, cannot avoid engaging with Marxist ideas around meaning, power, etc., if only to refute them. EG. It's arguable that Foucault's concept of discursive power, which is very different to Marxist ideology, exists *in tension* with it--it could not have been developed quite in that way without existing in contradistinction to existing Marxist works on power. Deleuze is the only one of these theorists who claims he is a Marxist--with others rather saying they *use* him but do not want to be named as Marxists as that is too restrictive. Notably, also, Deleuze conceives of his philosophy as a kind of 'buggery', an in-immaculate conception where he makes philosophers say things that they did not intend, which clarifies why he thinks he can be a Marxist without dialectics, and a Freudian while attacking the very foundations of Freud. 

-----------------
Sorry this was so long, but this is a broad overview of what each broad sub-school considers to be Marxism and their relationship to Marx. For me personally I like the whole 'Marxism is the merciless criticism of all that exists' and 'Communism is the movement to abolish things as they currently are'. But beyond that I'd say the bare bones of being a 'Marxist' require an attention to, if not adoption of, dialectical materialism or Hegelian dialectics, a critical and faithful attention to the Marxist corpus generally, and an acknowledgment of the role of political economy in structuring social life. 

TL:DR: No one really knows what Marxism is but generally criteria include: dialectics, political economy, centrality of class, or 'the merciless criticism of all that exists'

606,AskPhilosophy,"If I suck at explaining things, does that mean I don’t really understand what I’m trying to explain?","There's no more unfair saying than *""those who can't, teach""*. Teaching is a skill as any other, and one you can practice. The thing you must understand is what tools does someone need in order to make the cognitive leaps that you're asking of them. And then provide those tools. It is a very different thing to already have submerged yourself willingly in something that requires massive amounts of context, and being thrusted upon new, sometimes very indigestible, information.

At the same time, Augustine said about things so clear and obvious: *""but if I have to explain them, I  [realize I] don't know them.""* so my suggestion is: start making notes of your readings, of your learnings. While you're making those notes about x, ask yourself - ""what do I need to know in order to understand x?"" This will not only improve your teaching skills but your learning skills as well. 

You'll see that this clarity of structure will start to pop up in your explanations. But also don't be too hard on yourself. Philosophical thought may seem natural, as all of us entertain it in different degrees, but to have it as an actual skill takes practice. If you ask any random person why they think things exist rather than not existing, they'll see it as a non-question. A silly thought. Because they are not invested in the answer and it is set aside to the outskirts of relevance. That's why ethics is normally such an approachable topic, while ontology is not."
607,AskPhilosophy,"If I throw my friend from a 5 story building, but he gets head-shot mid air by someone else, who is to blame for my friend's death?","You might be interested in the concept of [overdetermination](https://iep.utm.edu/causatio/#SSH4aiii). Overdetermination happens when there are two (or more) causes, each on its own sufficient to bring about some effect.

In your example, both the throwing off a tall building and the shooting would by themselves be enough to cause your friends death - so we might say their death was overdetermined. The article I linked refers to this kind of example as 'asymmetric overdetermination' and also as 'preemption', just in case we didn't have enough terms.

Often overdetermination is raised as a problem for some theory of causation - but for your example I think it will help explain why we would want to assign blame to both parties, even if the shooting is what actually killed your friend."
608,AskPhilosophy,Any recommended reads on Existentialism from Black thinkers?,"As Volt said, Fanon is essential. George Yancey and Lewis Gordon are the people to look at for existential phenomenology. The latter makes a good argument for reading Du Bois as an American existentialist or proto-existentialist, especially because he was familiar with German philosophy. Ralph Ellison and Richard Wright are definitely a part of this story for Gordon and are great folks to read. I'm pretty sure Wright's Native Son was referenced in Fanon. Maldonado-Torres isn't black, but his book Against War is another work of critical phenomenology that is heavily influenced by Fanon and Latin American liberation philosophy through Dussel.

Another group that's currently pretty popular is the afro-pessimists, who take Fanon to a different conclusion. Frank Wilderson, Jared Sexton, Fred Moten, Hortense Spillers, and Saidiya Hartman are all associated with the movement, though I'd say only the first two are through and through afro-pessimists.

A lot of the feminist work from women of color that starts really picking up around the 80s is really important. Audre Lorde is one of the most influential thinkers in feminist and anti-racist theory. bell hooks and Alice Walker are also good folks to read, though the former is better for introductory work IMO. One of the big collections that was really important is This Bridge Called My Back, which had all sorts of folks in it and is worth the read. All these folks aren't phenomenologists or existentialists per se, but their work is very much relevant to the way that we do critical phenomenology today. Sara Ahmed (also not black, but is involved in these conversations) does some amazing work that heavily references folks like this and ties it back to phenomenology. Her most recent work Living a Feminist Life is awesome, but her older works Queer Phenomenology and The Cultural Politics of Emotion are more explicitly grounded in phenomenology. The most relevant work she's done to this specific topic would be On Being Included, which is about race and diversity.

The last person I'll mention is the Jamaican theorist and writer Sylvia Wynter. I think she's brilliant, but I don't know where to place her. All I can say is that she's worth reading."
609,AskPhilosophy,What is the point of being curious?,"Curious question, literally. To answer it, in the negative (for purposes of argument), presupposes curiosity as the limit value of the answer, i.e., even if curiosity is minimally valuable (your being ""rewarding to have answers""), it's answered out of curiosity.  To answer it, with a stronger utilitarian accent (your ""that's it?"" question), risks undercutting the question itself: if ""that's it"" (and this is a very big ""if"" for me), it's answered via curiosity, which, as is implied in ""that's it?"", may not finally be worthwhile. This further suggests that the question itself may not be structurally meaningful, if that's all that's implied in being curious. Put simply, it's self-defeating as such. The question, at a strictly logical level, begs the question of what's put into question, even if unwittingly. In a sense, then, contrary to form, the question itself demonstrates how properly basic curiosity is. Curiosity = questioning.

I suspect, however, that the question does not pertain to form or structure. If the value of being curious is determined by some other disposition, for example, satisfaction (material, existential, etc.), the answer to your question will vary according to the scale of values one holds and how curiosity serves that scale. If one sides with Socrates (and western civilization in general), that the unexamined life isn't worth living, then curiosity will be aligned with that scale of values in such a way that diminishes the weight of the ""that's it?"" question."
610,AskPhilosophy,"If there is a universe with nothing consciously observing it, does it exist?","Intuitively, I would think the answer is yes. Looking at the history of our own universe, it seems to be far older than conscious life.

There are those who might argue against that though, George Berkeley coming especially to mind, putting his idea quite bluntly as ""to be is to be perceived."" His argument is that the only thing that ever really exists are ideas, and ideas must exist in some mind. The only thing we ever perceive after all are ideas, so why suppose there is anything else? For cases like the apparent existence of the universe before life, he would say that God observed it, so it really was mind-dependent."
611,AskPhilosophy,Why does Freud/Psychoanalysis come up a lot in philosophy discussions?,"Accepting Freudian thought has serious implications for philosophical questions. For example, in the realm of political philosophy, the notion that our actions are determined by specific unconscious drives presents a challenge to other notions, namely the Marxian idea that the economic mode of production is the primary motivator of human action.  The 20th century gave us many philosophers and psychologists who were compelled by aspects of both theories (Fromm, Reich, Adorno, Lacan—just to name a few)."
612,AskPhilosophy,"Is there a philosophical position whereby a person believes in ""a higher power"" but does not necessarily believe that higher power to be a god, rather they believe it is a force or a power for instance?","There's a few terms that mean similar things.

Pantheism means everything *is* a divinity. Not necessarily every single thing, but a comprehensive everything.

Panenthism says everything exists in a divinity. More narrowly it means that everything is part of a divinity, but the absolute exists beyond the world.

Ultimism is a more obscure term, but it literally means what you said exactly. The word theism isn't included to specifically make it clear its not calling it a god.

Transtheism is hard to define, but it basically means ""between theism and atheism."" Basically that something exists that is *like* a god, but that that doesn't necessarily mean that it is a necessarily thing you have to use as a telos to give context to reality in an explicit way.

Basically, of these terms ultimism is by far the least well known, but its the most direct translation of what you asked."
613,AskPhilosophy,Do People Have an Over-Confidence in Science/Scientists?,"I think you have correctly noticed that your belief in science is through trust, which is also what motivates people to believe their reverend who tells them God created the Earth 6000 years ago. But not all trust is equal. Some people or institutions are more trustworthy than others.    


So insofar as your worry is that your belief in science is not justified because it is formed by the same process which forms religious beliefs, then I think you can relax. Just because they share a process does not mean they are equally justified. However, if your question is ""is the institution of science trustworthy?"" than that is a separate question which I leave for others who are more knowledgeable than me to answer."

615,AskPhilosophy,What is post-structuralism's gripe with linguistics?,"1 - As an art historian, i will admit that though i love Deleuze, Baudrillard and even Derrida to some extent, it does feel like their commentary on my field sometimes is, at best, interesting conceptions from someone outside the field and at worst, kind of irritating texts totally alien to what we learn inside the courses, so i do share this frustration.

2 - Derrida actually is more interested in the relationship between writing and speech than in trying to ""bring speech down"" as it were. In difference, for example, he says that ""What fascinates me is rather the strange space between speech and writing"" (in an interview he even said he doesnt even like writing that much lol). He seems interested in the ways both acts affect and change each other, he doesnt really tear down ""phonocentrism"" for not being more natural than writing, its more that in his mind, prioritizing speech hides the writing that is *inside* the speech. Thats part of what makes his work so hard for me sometimes, the fact that it can be so circular and slow and his method so misteryous, it is in a way to account for this kind of nebulous area between both. I know in another text, for example, he says that there is no society without writing, and by that he doesnt mean literal writing, he means archivization, territorial marks, etc, which to him means that even animals ""write"".

3 - Deleuze & Guattari's gripe with Chomsky to me seems similar to their gripe with Freud - that they seem to diagnose *a* form or structure and simply assume that all language must work from or towards that same thing. They actually dont think being ""arborescent"" is a necessarily bad thing, they mention in another chapter that rhizomes have arborescent sections and vice versa, the seem to just oppose it as a unified structure. It is of note that their thoughts on linguistics are very devouted to the work of Hjelmslev, who instead of the binary of Saussure (who is both binary which is a thing D&G really dont care for and qualitative), works on Expression/Content, both of which can take on form and substance (meaning it is a system with four different parts). Hjelmslev (not dissimilar from Derrida now that i think about it) was reacting to a current in linguistics that said that the focus of analysis should be Phonemes, he says that language is more about ""context"" than it is about proper ""meaning"" from what i understand (which is not much, he did say at one point that in his view, linguistics should be an ""algebra of language"").

At the end of the day, a lot of what their problems boil down to is that they dont see language as something that can be isolated and they dont see language as a fixed model."
616,AskPhilosophy,"How does Chomsky's anarchism, that asks systems of hierarchy to justify themselves, respond to Locke's justification that the government essential roles is to protect life, liberty, and property, where government is a representative group?","You can read Godwin

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anarchism/

>An important historical touchstone is William Godwin. Unlike Locke and Hobbes who turned to the social contract to lead us out of the anarchic state of nature, Godwin argued that the resulting governmental power was not necessarily better than anarchy. Locke, of course, allows for revolution when the state becomes despotic. Godwin builds upon that insight. He explained, “we must not hastily conclude that the mischiefs of anarchy are worse than those which government is qualified to produce” (Godwin 1793: bk VII, chap. V, p. 736). He claimed,

>It is earnestly to be desired that each man should be wise enough to govern himself, without the intervention of any compulsory restraint; and, since government, even in its best state, is an evil, the object principally to be aimed at is that we should have as little of it as the general peace of human society will permit.

617,AskPhilosophy,Is it a moral duty to acquire knowledge?,"Man I don't remember this stuff on Aristotle and morality as clearly as I should but...

If one should act in a virtuous way, and A believes that there are circumstances that determine whether an action is virtuous or not, then A might at least say that one is morally responsible to understand circumstances and whats makes things virtuous or not virtuous. As /u/fingin says, if you have to find out what is right or wrong, you have to understand how to classify things into those categories in the first place.

Tangentially related if you are interested in A and morality: A's intention to hold objective standards in the form of virtues while stipulating that virtuousness actually depends on the situation, has created some dialogue on the topic of objective and subjective morality. See Martha Nussbaum, “Non-Relative Virtues: An Aristotelian Approach”."
618,AskPhilosophy,"Many Physicists believe that the Physical Constants of our universe could have been different, and that a universe could exist in which the physical constants are different. Does this mean that all* of our scientific knowledge which we once thought was necessary is actually contingent?","There is a ton of debate on whether the laws of nature are necessary, and both positions you roughly outline are to be found in it. You can read up on it here: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/laws-of-nature/#Nec. 

In it there's a ton on what parts of the laws would be necessary for it all to be necessary as well. 

Very roughly, one position (found e.g. in Kripke) would be that the laws are only the same if they are exactly the same - that is, if the constants changed, they would be different. But, the argument goes, the laws of nature are necessary, hence it is impossible for the constants to be different. 

However, others argue against that. Alan Sidelle, for example, thinks that it's all just linguistic convention and that it is indeed possible for the laws of nature to be different, for example by the constants being different.

eta: It's worth considering in what form physicists think the constants could have been different, and how that differs to philosophers. One way physicists could mean this would be that the universe would still work if the constants were different. This isn't quite the same as what people such as Kripke mean. What Kripke means is that if we had gravity with  the constant G in our universe and with the constant G' in another possible universe, Kripke argues we should not call the phenomenon gravity (but rather, say, schravity) because the way we use the word gravity involves G, and not G'. This isn't necessarily an argument against the possibility of G', but rather one on how we use the word. Of course, other philosophers would argue that G is necessary in all possible worlds.

If you are interested, I'd recommend this paper:

Sidelle, Alan. 2002. On the Metaphysical Contingency of Laws of Nature. In Conceivability and 
Possibility, T. Szabó Gendler and J. Hawthorne, (eds.). Oxford: Clarendon Press. 

While its set-up and structure is... not very good, I think it does lay out the main arguments from necessitarians quite well and provides possible attacks.

ETA2: I wrote a (grad school) paper analyzing Sidelle's arguments a few months ago, send me a PM if you want it, I hope it would be an easier read than the original - however, it concentrates on Sidelle's arguments, not the necessitarians.

Nietzsche describes consciousness as seeing oneself in a mirror – it is a reflective self-awareness. He suggests early humans could think, feel, will, remember and act without consciousness.  In fact, he says that the greater part of our life takes place without consciousness – we simply feel, think, remember and act without the mirror-affect of consciousness. So what purpose does it have? 

Nietzsche offers the speculative answer that consciousness is proportionate to a capacity for communication – a more sophisticated consciousness develops with a greater ability to communicate. Nietzsche adds that a group’s capacity to communicate depends on its need to communicate and understand each other quickly with subtlety. Now, our ability to communicate has surpassed our needs. 

Nietzsche takes the point further by proposing that consciousness has developed only due to a need for communication (if humans had lived as solitary beasts of prey, then they would not have developed consciousness). Humans needed to express themselves to survive, which required consciousness – the reflective awareness, the mirror – to first “know” how one felt and what one thought so that it could then be expressed. Yet, the conscious understanding we have of ourselves is superficial, a mere shadow of our actual thoughts and feelings (*TGS* 179, 244).

An implication of this claim is that an individual’s consciousness is shared; we experience consciousness privately, but consciousness co-developed with language, so it is shared by others who were part of the development of language. Consequently, we cannot be conscious of ourselves individually because our consciousness is, by its nature, a herd consciousness – our attempts to know ourselves are interpreted through our herd consciousness. Nietzsche insists that our actions, thoughts, feelings and so forth are unique to us, but we can only interpret them through our herd-consciousness, which means we cannot know ourselves completely as we are. 

This, he says, is the essence of phenomenalism and perspectivism as I understand them: Owing to the nature of our consciousness, the world that we can become conscious of is only a surface and sign-world; in other words, we only become aware of the world through a shared language, which only provides a superficial representation of it."
620,AskPhilosophy,Where can I find good quality criticisms of left-wing concepts?,"It's great that you are looking to challenge your own beliefs. Since academia is predominantly left-wing, it's sometimes easy to get by without having your views challenged, just like it's easy to not have one's atheistic views challenged these days.

Some recommendations:

* *Why Not Capitalism?* by Jason Brennan is a short critique of socialism, especially of the brand you get in G.A. Cohen's *Why Not Socialism?* (Video presentations and podcasts available on YouTube as well.)

* *The Problem of Political Authority* (Palgrave: 2013) by Michael Huemer is a book that defends (1) philosophical anarchism (the view that governments are morally illegitimate and have no political authority), and (2) the viability of political anarchism (in particular, anarcho-capitalism). The book also defends a general right-libertarian ethic.

* ""Is Wealth Redistribution a Rights Violation?"" by Michael Huemer is an article that argues that redistributive taxation violates individuals' property rights. https://philpapers.org/archive/HUEIWR.pdf

* *Libertarianism: What Everyone Needs to Know* by Jason Brennan (Oxford University Press: 2012). This book is a general Q&A / FAQ book about libertarianism that presents some basic counter-arguments to common left-wing ideas.

* Select chapters from *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* (Basic Books: 1974) by Robert Nozick. As you probably know, this is *the seminal* libertarian text in the history of contemporary philosophy. The chapters that will most concern left-wing views begins in Part II of the book (pg. 149), which is all about distributive justice. (Part III is a diamond in the rough, though!)

* Select entries in [*Arguments for Liberty*](https://cdn.cato.org/libertarianismdotorg/books/Arguments_For_Liberty.pdf?__hstc=&__hssc=&hsCtaTracking=5059bd47-514a-432f-9a71-cb1d5b7246dd%7Caa5c4af1-b7de-4d0c-841b-aae00880324f) (2016) — recommended: entries by Eric Mack on ""natural rights"", Michael Huemer on ""Ethical Intuitionism"" and Jason Brennan on ""pluralism""). 

* ""Sweatshops, Choice, And Exploitation"" by Matt Zwolinski (2007). [article here](http://benjaminferguson.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Zwolinski-2007-Business-Ethics-Quarterly.pdf) This paper defends the following thesis: there is a ""moral claim against interference in the conditions of sweatshop labor by third parties such as governments or consumer boycott groups"". Here's a video of the author presenting similar ideas as in the paper and exploitation in general (he is also the author of the SEP entry on ""Exploitation""): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4hOrZaJPHg

* *Markets without Limits* by Jason Brennan & Peter Jaworski (2015). This book argues against theorists like Michael Sandel, Debra Satz and Elizabeth Anderson that there should be limits on certain economic activities. That is, it defends the libertarian view that markets should be permissible in every industry (e.g., in prostitution, in kidney sales, etc.).

* Various entries on www.bleedingheartlibertarians.com, such as the following by Jason Brennan, which criticizes ideas like a ""living wage"" or ""minimum wage"": http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2013/07/against-the-living-wagesubsidy-arguments/ (many, many articles/entries to read down this rabbit hole) BHL has been on fire over the past few years.

* *Unequivocal Justice* (2017) by Christopher Freiman which I haven't had the opportunity to read, but Jason Brennan claims is the best book in political philosophy of 2017 that supposedly eviscerates Rawlsian left-liberalism. Speaking of Rawlsianism more generally, philosophers like Gerald Gaus (probably the most influential), John Tomasi and Kevin Vallier all operate in the public reason tradition and, in many cases, love Rawls. They just think that classical liberalism is what is most compatible with Rawls' framework, rather than Rawls' social democracy or left-liberalism. (Gaus is probably the most right-wing of the three.)

* *Routledge Handbook of Libertarianism* (2017) also just came out. Lots of amazing entries in there by some leading political philosophers, though I haven't been able to read the whole thing myself yet (one entry, by Jason Brennan & Bas Van der Vossen, defends libertarianism vs. left-liberal views of economic rights and how to conceive of the self-ownership thesis). 

* Various entries by Michael Huemer here on libertarianism.org: ""An Ethical Intuitionist Case for Libertarianism"" https://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/ethical-intuitionist-case-libertarianism; and ""Is Taxation Theft?"" https://www.libertarianism.org/columns/is-taxation-theft (These are more accessible for a general audience.)

Those are some off the top of my head. I'm sure there are a bunch more awesome resources; I just can't think of them right now! "
621,AskPhilosophy,Are there any works out there that discusses how one's ability to be able to engage in 'intellectual' subjects like art and philosophy greatly hinges on one's material conditions and other societal factors like race/gender/sexuality? And how does this affect such 'intellectual' subjects itself?,"Plenty of canonical philosophers have made the point concerning material conditions, including Plato (in the Phaedo there’s a brief comment, and I believe in it’s discussed more extensively in Republic as well) and Aristotle (In the Nic Ethics, If I remember correctly—he states that leisure, which requires certain material conditions, is necessary to do philosophy). A number of other have made similar claims—my apologies that I can’t remember exactly who and where—but that’s to say that these philosophers were not at all ignorant of the privileged position of philosophy, though it was of course within certain cultural and societal limitations. 

I think that art’s a bit trickier. The notion of “art for art’s sake” and not art for the sake of something else (worship, divinity, adornment, commission) is a relatively new thing, from what little I understand. There’s a passage in Kant about display, and the “proper way” to view art—he brings notions of blankness and purity forward as the ideal situation of viewing art for its own sake, thereby removing art from the living, worldly context in which it once existed. Heidegger has written extensively on artist/art and art/world relations in ways that I personally find incredibly helpful, but I don’t think they’ll hold up  to the demands of your question. 

So much of the later phenomenologists/existentialists spoke to the intertwined nature of art and thought, especially in the case of theater; Antonin Artaud’s “The Theater and its Double” comes to mind, along with some sections from Merleau Ponty’s “Sense and Nonsense.” I’m sure there’s some Sartre that would fit in there too. 

None of these suggestions, of course, are centred around the idea of different “intellectual” disciplines hinging on material/social conditions. If you look to the notion of context and its effects on  thought more broadly, however, a number of thinkers come to mind. Herbert Marcuse in both One Dimensional Man and Eros and Civilization goes on at length about material and societal conditions influencing and determining our philosophising—which is a really cool synthesis of Freud and Marx, among others. 

There’s likely some sort of contemporary analytic thought addressing this question, but I’m unfamiliar with that stuff and in that regard completely unhelpful."
622,AskPhilosophy,How does ontology influence politics?,"If ontology is ultimately a matter of *commitment* to what does and does not exist, then it is likely that the *kinds of things* that one admits into one's ontology is likely to structure the kinds of political claims one makes, even if only indirectly. Consider a rather basic ontological claim by the renowned philosopher Margaret Thatcher: ""there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families"". A claim like this is meant - among other things - to disqualify certain interventions aimed at altering things at a 'societal' level, restricting policy to intervening at the level of individuals and their families (the implication being that doing otherwise would be ineffective, wasteful, or even directly harmful).

Someone else who, admitting society as a having a certain ontological standing, might come to very different conclusions as to the kinds of political interventions one ought to stage. One imagines that at a colloquium involving Thatcher and Marx, the Iron Lady would only stand aghast at the idea that ""the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles"". This latter statement would be practically unintelligible given the ontological commitments of former. In this sense, ontology can inform politics by showing one 'where to look': a question of admitting what counts, and does not count, as a suitable site of political action. At another level, one might consider how questions of contingency and necessity can be cashed out in political terms. Here is Levi Bryant, discussing this topic better than I can:

""\[Contingency and necessity can have\] important political implications. If it is true that everything is contingent, then it’s also true that every social order is contingent. There is no reason that societies \*have\* to be organized in this particular way. If it is true that there is no reason that societies \*have\* to be in this particular way, then we are free to envision and fight for other types of social formations. In my view, every revolutionary political philosophy is premised on the thesis that being and the form society takes are contingent. By contrast, we will find that every reactionary politics always puts forward a thesis about necessity, whether through claiming that human nature is such that this is the only way that society can be organized without disaster (“people are just greedy, so communism could never work!"") or by arguing that this is naturally the way in which society must be organized. Both of these positions – the revolutionary and the reactionary – presuppose very different ontologies"". ([source](https://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/on-the-relationship-between-politics-and-ontology/))

One might be able to see this sort of thing at work in current debates over climate change: do humans have the kind of agency powerful enough to alter the climate in the way the science says? Or is climate change the result of inevitable changes wrought simply by the nature of things? The really fun debates are a little bit more 'meta' than this, and have to do with how any particular ontology might even make room for anything resembling 'political action' at all. Hannah Arendt, for instance, famously made the case that the very possibility of politics was being slowly foreclosed by changes made in the way people thought about themselves and acted (in this case ontology is, as it were, something lived). Recent left-wing critiques of what is called neoliberalism charge that insofar as 'the market' now stands as the arbiter of what effectively exists or not, whole swathes of Earthly populations are effectively consigned to a state of non-existence. Accepting this kind of critique obviously implies a rethinking of what 'ontology' is too - something other than just an intellectual discipline, but almost a name for a set of historical (""epochal"" is the go-to Conty word) configurations, as it were.

Anyway, just trying to paint with a broad brush, the political views expressed here not necessarily mine."
623,AskPhilosophy,What did Hegel think of America?,"He had some... things... to say about America in the introduction to the *Lectures on the Philosophy of History*. You can read the whole relevant portion near the end of the Introduction, but here are some excerpts of the general idea:

>America has always shown itself physically and psychically powerless, and still shows itself so. For the aborigines, after the landing of the Europeans in America, gradually vanished at the breath of European activity. In the United States of North America all the citizens are of European descent, with whom the old inhabitants could not amalgamate, but were driven back. The aborigines have certainly adopted some arts and usages from the Europeans, among others that of brandy-drinking, which has operated with deadly effect. In the South the natives were treated with much greater violence, and employed in hard labors to which their strength was by no means competent. A mild and passionless disposition, want of spirit, and a crouching submissiveness towards a Creole, and still more towards a European, are the chief characteristics of the native Americans; and it will be long before the Europeans succeed in producing any independence of feeling in them. The inferiority of these individuals in all respects, even in regard to size, is very manifest; only the quite southern races in Patagonia are more vigorous natures, but still abiding in their natural condition of rudeness and barbarism.
>
>[...]
>
>The original nation having vanished or nearly so, the effective population comes for the most part from Europe; and what takes place in America, is but an emanation from Europe. Europe has sent its surplus population to America in much the same way as from the old Imperial Cities, where trade-guilds were dominant and trade was stereotyped, many persons escaped to other towns which were not under such a yoke, and where the burden of imposts was not so heavy.
>
>[...]
>
>As to the political condition of North America, the general object of the existence of this State is not yet fixed and determined, and the necessity for a firm combination does not yet exist; for a real State and a real Government arise only after a distinction of classes has arisen, when wealth and poverty become extreme, and when such a condition of things presents itself that a large portion of the people can no longer satisfy its necessities in the way in which it has been accustomed so to do. But America is hitherto exempt from this pressure, for it has the outlet of colonization constantly and widely open, and multitudes are continually streaming into the plains of the Mississippi. By this means the chief source of discontent is removed, and the continuation of the existing civil condition is guaranteed. A comparison of the United States of North America with European lands is therefore impossible; for in Europe, such a natural outlet for population, notwithstanding all the emigrations that take place, does not exist. Had the woods of Germany been in existence, the French Revolution would not have occurred. North America will be comparable with Europe only after the immeasurable space which that country presents to its inhabitants shall have been occupied, and the members of the political body shall have begun to be pressed back on each other. North America is still in the condition of having land to begin to cultivate. Only when, as in Europe, the direct increase of agriculturists is checked, will the inhabitants, instead of pressing outwards to occupy the fields, press inwards upon each other—pursuing town occupations, and trading with their fellow-citizens; and so form a compact system of civil society, and require an organized state. The North American Federation have no neighboring State (towards which they occupy a relation similar to that of European States to each other), one which they regard with mistrust, and against which they must keep up a standing army. Canada and Mexico are not objects of fear, and England has had fifty years' experience, that *free* America is more profitable to her than it was in a state of *dependence*. The militia of the North American Republic proved themselves quite as brave in the War of Independence as the Dutch under Philip II; but generally, where Independence is not at stake, less power is displayed, and in the year 1814 the militia held out but indifferently against the English. 
>
>America is therefore the land of the future, where, in the ages that lie before us, the burden of the World’s History shall reveal itself—perhaps in a contest between North and South America. It is a land of desire for all those who are weary of the historical lumber-room of old Europe. Napoleon is reported to have said: ""*Cette vieille Europe m’ennuie*."" It is for America to abandon the ground on which hitherto the History of the World has developed itself. What has taken place in the New World up to the present time is only an echo of the Old World—the expression of a foreign Life; and as a Land of the Future, it has no interest for us here, for, as regards History, our concern must be with that which has been and that which is."
624,AskPhilosophy,How much do academic philosophers read on average?,I don't really keep track but I think on average I read about one article and one book chapter per day. Very approximately.
625,AskPhilosophy,Is academic philosophy as shitty as it seems?,"I considered applying to grad school in philosophy during my undergraduate days. I still distinctly remember the *exact* moment when I realized it was a bad idea.

Some friends and I were visiting the library at Sewanee for some philosophy research materials that our (very much smaller) college library just didn't have. I finished my project before my friends did and spent some time wandering around the philosophy collection. It was almost an entire floor, if I remember correctly. *Thousands* of volumes.

I perused a random selection. At that point, in the early 2000s, though the library had introduced a digital card catalog, all of the books still had physical cards that showed their borrowing history, including the date they were added to the collection and each time they were checked out. I looked at volume after volume and checked that record. A *very* high percentage of them had not been checked out for decades. Many had *never been checked out since being acquired*. I found this inexpressibly depressing. Someone had clearly put a lot of work into each of these books that *nobody* was reading. By contrast, there were perhaps a couple-odd dozen philosophy books on reserve down by the circulation desk. Some were anthologies and/or textbooks, but quite a few primary materials as well. Clearly stuff professors were assigning for class reading.

The moment I realized I didn't want to get a Ph.D. in philosophy was the moment it occurred to me that if I did that, *I* was going to have to write a philosophy book. My thesis. Probably more than one, if I ever wanted to be successful. And being honest with myself, I wasn't going to write one of the books on reserve downstairs. I was going to write one of the mass of books up in the stacks that nobody ever reads.

I went to law school. "
626,AskPhilosophy,What effect did Chomsky have on philosophy?,"Chomsky's been pretty engaged with two important branches of contemporary philosophy: language and mind. His book, New Horizons In The Study Of Language And Mind lays out some key philosophical commitments, including methodological naturalism (belief that we can study L&M using the methods of the natural sciences) and semantic internalism (that there is no word-world relation like reference or denotation). His work has certainly influenced philosophers such as Fodor (a great deal in his case), Searle, Grice, (slightly obliquely and less neatly) Davidson.

I can add more if you have more questions."
627,AskPhilosophy,Did Marx think that capitalism is historically necessary? Did he change his mind?,"If you look at the Preface to the Russian Edition of the Manifesto in 1882 (so just one year before Marx died), Marx says:
> Now the question is: can the Russian obshchina, though greatly undermined, yet a form of primeval common ownership of land, pass directly to the higher form of Communist common ownership? Or, on the contrary, must it first pass through the same process of dissolution such as constitutes the historical evolution of the West?

>The only answer to that possible today is this: If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the West, so that both complement each other, the present Russian common ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist development.

I asked my professor a similar question and he recommended the book *Late Marx and the Russian Road* by Teodor Shanin which addresses Marx's shifting stances vis-a-vis Russia, you might want to check it out."

630,AskPhilosophy,"Is math only a human construct; that is to say, do humans discover math, or do we invent it?","There are some intermediate positions here, namely that it is constructed in a non-arbitrary way due to constraints on how we experience the world.  The idea that mathematics is a way our minds structure reality is called *intuitionism*.

The most popular position in philosophy, including among philosophers of mathematics, however is that it is discovered in a more robust sense.  That is, the objects that are discussed in math exist as abstract objects.  This position is called *Platonism*."
631,AskPhilosophy,"I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but why does it matter if life has meaning? And what does that even mean?","Susan Wolf argues that meaning is an important category because it fulfils what Bernard Williams calls our 'categorical desires'. From Wolf's ""One Thought Too Many"" article (p. 157-8):

>[Categorical desires] root one, motivationally, to the world both interestedly and disinterestedly. A person who has no categorical desires or no prospect of those desires ever being satisfied may find himself not caring, not only about his own life, but about anything at all. Although it is terribly sad to contemplate a person with such an outlook, I take it that Williams would not find such a person irrational, and I am inclined to agree. ... If he does not care about anything at all, it is not obvious that there is any reason why he should. And if he does not care about himself or the world, it is hard to see why he would or should care about morality.

Those projects, relationships, and goals that one finds meaningful are those things that ""root one to the world"". Williams calls them the kind of thing that either answers the question, ""why should I go on living?"" or keeps the question from being asked in the first place. 

The meaning Wolf talks about—and she takes Williams to be talking about—is different than the Sartre/Camus discussion because they're largely rejecting an external *telos* or purpose/meaning to life. What is often called ""meaning of life"", whereas Wolf is concerned with ""meaning *in* life""—but if we're not talking about the level meaning enters into lives, her answer still seems suitable to your question."
632,AskPhilosophy,How do we know that things like murder and rape are obviously wrong?,"u/Voltairinede gave an account of how to *explain* the wrongness of murder and rape. But the question is how we know these acts are wrong, and the answer to that seems to me -- along with a bunch of philosophers -- ""It's common sense"". 

In fact, many counterexamples to ethical theories like utilitarianism or even Kantian deontology take the following form: *find a case where obviously we ought to do P and the theory in question recommends not-P*.

E.g.: (1) we can construct situations where rape is required to maximise utility, and therefore utilitarianism must be wrong or (2) we should straightforwardly lie to protect human life, therefore Kantian morality is wrong."
633,AskPhilosophy,Chomsky says in an article that postmodernism/theory has no substance and that none of his colleagues were able to answer his questions. Can anyone answer his questions?,"There's two parts to this:  


1.) Let's take Derrida for example--partly because he's the easiest target for this kind shit. Derrida's deconstruction is a complex, subversive attack on what he considers the metaphysics of presence. For Derrida, Western thought is structured in such a way that our entire edifice of thinking is based on a set of binary terms in which one thing is de-prioritized in favor of another. E.g. Speech, as a signfier of presence/the present is privileged over writing. Ever been in a literature class where a teacher says something that seems a bit outlandish and a student asks ""how can we know that the author really meant that?"" Why is our thought about writings structured so that we care what Shakespeare really meant, as if we were trying to get as close as possible to what he would say if he were really present?  


To care more about what Shakespeare would say then what the text can variously say in our classroom is not wrong, but for Derrida, there is no absolute reason to prioritize this presence of the author over the plurality of meaning in his absence.  


The problem, and this is why Chomsky doesn't understand theory/philosophy, is that it's not about being factual or not. It's about the very structure of how some thoughts become thinkable and others recede into subterranean depths. It's not about basing things on evidence--it's about asking the very questions of how evidence comes to be connected to claims in the first place.  


Insisting that theorists explain their theories in easy-to-understand simple versions is silly because so much of theory is an all-out skepticism of common sense. Common sense, after all, is a set of patterns for thinking that are not necessarily true or well-grounded, but are often useful. Theory, insofar as it tries to get us to think radically outside the most persistent, lowest level foundations of these patterns, is literally non-sense.

2.) Chomsky is brilliant, but he's not trained as a philosopher in the same tradition as most of the people he's critiquing. Philosophy--especially continental philosophy--is a really, really long tradition. You can't *really* understand the complexity of what Derrida means by ""presence"" without understanding what Heidegger means by ""presence."" You can't understand Heidegger without Husserl. You can't understand Husserl without Kant, and you can't understand Kant without reading him very, very closely. For Kant, you should know your classics, too.  


This isn't obscurantism. It's just a few thousand years of intellectual architecture."
634,AskPhilosophy,Are there any philosophers who seriously defend nihilism?,"What kind of nihilism are you asking about? Because for example, much of Western philosophy has been shaped by a response to an _acceptance_ of [existential nihilism](https://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/#H3). Quoting from that link:

> In *The Dark Side: Thoughts on the Futility of Life* (1994), Alan Pratt demonstrates that existential nihilism, in one form or another, has been a part of the Western intellectual tradition from the beginning.

Pratt traces it back to the ancient Greeks.

As such, it could make more sense to ask whether there are any philosophers who seriously *reject* existential nihilism. Although of course the answer to that is yes, for example theistic philosophers.

Similarly, there are certainly philosophers who defend moral nihilism.

Of course, you're probably asking about a broader definition of nihilism, like the one at the beginning of the first link above, ""the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated."" I'd be tempted to try and defend that position, but since nothing can be known or communicated, it would be pointless. 

Seriously, that link also answers your question, saying ""few philosophers would claim to be nihilists [in that sense]."""
635,AskPhilosophy,Is Buddhism a philosophy or a religion?,"In areas where Buddhism is traditionally prevalent, there is no idea of 'religion' and 'philosophy' as being different things. 

*Religion* as an analytical category is a Western invention. In Tibetan and Sanskrit, two languages traditionally used in Buddhism, there isn't really a word for religion. Buddhist writers refer to Buddhism with the equally untranslatable word *dharma*, which has connotations of law, practice, virtue, and teachings. In Japan, if you ask people if they're 'religious', almost all will say no, but if you ask if they practice Buddhist or Shinto rituals, almost all will say yes. 

All of the great Buddhist philosophers were also practitioners. From the Buddhist viewpoint, studying philosophy without also practicing the 'religious' aspects of Buddhism like meditation and ethics is a total waste of time. The purpose of Buddhist philosophy is to train your mind and progress towards enlightenment."
636,AskPhilosophy,"Have no formal education in philosophy it is just something I really enjoy researching, what is the best way to keep notes or journal self-taught philosophy?","I always understand the most when I have to write exam essays on a specific question relating to the class. So maybe try writing short essays on what you are reading. Look up the topic you are working on, SEP is always golden. Then find a problem or disagreement in the vein of: critically asses the claim that equality is not required for justice. Or maybe as simple as outlining the different views on a topic.

For me, the thing I realized was that I just couldnt read something once and take notes. I have to work with the text and challenge it before actually Learning, not just memorizing small snippets."
637,AskPhilosophy,I'm graduating college soon. What great philosophy papers should I download from my library's databases before I lose access?,"My suggestion is to look into [Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub). It's great for circumventing pay-walls for academic papers, it works especially well if you get the Chrome extension."
638,AskPhilosophy,Why is there such a strong aversion regarding relativism in philosophy?,"Relativism implies that rational consensus is not possible: if truth is whatever seems right to you, the only way I can change your mind is through nonrational means (persuasion, extortion etc.). It is no coincidence that Protagoras was the main antagonist to Plato. Philosophy, from the very beginning, was motivated by the experience of the forceless force of the better argument, as Habermas somewhere puts it. Relativism is essentially the denial that there even is such a thing as a better argument, full stop: what's better is whatever seems better to you - or your community. 

Briefly put, relativism contradicts philosophy's self-understanding as a science of reasons."
639,AskPhilosophy,"If we are, by nature, compelled to ponder the meaning of life, does that mean that life definitely has a meaning?","I would say that human nature doesn't have a bearing on the existence or non-existence to a meaning of life.  To answer your question I would propose a thought experiment. Imagine if you will a world in which there is no meaning of life. It would still be possible for many to live in this world, pondering for their whole lives whether their lives are meaningful or not. If this scenario is possible, we could very easily live in such a world."

642,AskPhilosophy,Why was Being and Time more influential than Process and Reality?,"The obvious answer here is that you probably couldn't have picked a better date for *Being & Time* than 1927; it is decidedly a book of the 1920s, both in terms of the questions it deals with and the thriving German intellectual landscape that it emerged out of. This is, ultimately, how books find their audience: Not by being the most ""groundbreaking"" but by adressing the right questions at the right time, at the right people. Meanwhile, Whitehead was a perennial outsider to philosophy and published *Process & Reality* in English, at a time when in the Anglosphere, the driving intellectual forces largely considered grand speculative metaphysics to be a dusty relic of the 19th century. Since then, Whitehead has simply faced the fate of all highly idiosyncratic, non-canonical thinkers: They are just too much effort to get into and too peripheral to common debates to be worthwhile for the general philosophical public (unless there is some sort of revival; Deleuze, the great gravedigger of philosophy, seems to at least have slightly increased interested in Whitehead over the last few decades)."
643,AskPhilosophy,"To what extent can we ""forgive"" people's views based on the social/historical context?","The example I like to use is the environment.  I would admit that the science is perhaps a bit unclear, although the trends are clear, but let's just say for the sake of argument that in 50 years the science *is* clear that there are a set of specific behaviors and tools that are found to be clearly responsible for the destruction of the planet's atmosphere and ecology.  In this future dystopia, the world is as some of our current cultural narratives indicate...a quasi-apocalyptic world where crime is high, resources are depleted, and so forth.  In that hypothetical, the occupants would speak of us like we do of those in our past (slave owners, anti-semites, etc.).  Imagine it.  Here's a paragraph from some future historian:

""They used to own and *frequently used* combustion engines, with no thought for the future.  Every adult drove a car, flew on airplanes, heated their homes with fossil fuels, and each were aware of the effects those tools had on the environment.  But they continued onward with the destruction, some with indignation, some out of necessity, but each knew they were sowing the seeds of destruction we are now reaping.  The scientists told them.  The newspapers told them.  Their own children told them.  But by willful ignorance, they stripped the earth of her resources with no care for the world they created for us.  They dined on meat raised in factories *en masse*, they destroyed valuable ecosystems with their diets of grain that even the most naive of them could see on a Sunday drive through the country, with miles of corn fields extracting valuable nutrients from the soil.  And while most knew in the back of their minds what damage they were doing, each passed on the responsibility to the next until it was diluted to the point of individual absolvence.  The knew.  They all knew.  But they didn't care, or cared too much for their cool air in the summers, the convenience an automobile afforded them, the taste of rare steak, and their vacations across the land.""

This isn't a prediction, it's just something I like to think about when I think of the Founding Fathers or 19th century philosophers.  We are so sure that we've transcended temporal morality, that we have it all right now.  What if in some future time we discover that animals are far more sentient than we now think?  Imagine the atrocities we are committing by owning pets and eating meat and visiting zoos?  My god, a zoo would be like Auschwitz to them, and we just laugh and take pleasure from their pain as we eat ice cream and stroll through the cages.  And I don't believe any of this, it's just a thought experiment.

I think it's also important to differentiate between the writings and the writer.  Dostoyevsky is one of my favorites, but I certainly am not an anti-semite."
644,AskPhilosophy,Has any philosophy been done on authenticity of self on and off psychiatric medications?,"> When I was taking ADHD meds, I always used to wonder who the ""real"" me was--the one on the Adderal, or the one off of it.

It can certainly change your behavior. There's good evidence of this, especially in high doses. I can't remember the psychological term, but there's a behavior that happens where some people who take amphetmaines in particular locations tend to stay in that location. So if one takes it in their room, they might be more likely to stay in the room. Maybe someone knows the actual term...

Also keep in mind too that the point of taking the drug if you have ADHD is to treat 'symptoms' (I'm using this word gingerly here for this disorder) of ADHD. These symptoms are cashed out in terms of behavioral tendencies -- less emotional control, less ability to self-regulate (not necessarily just deficiency in attention), among other bad tendencies. If your behaviors and what you do is an important part of who you are, then yeah this type of drug use clearly does change who you are. I'm not sure why change is bad though. 

> people on these meds often question whether it has changed them into ""someone else.""

People often do this in plenty of situations, not just when taking pharmaceuticals, although it may be more common to think about and talk about nowadays. 

> I always used to wonder who the ""real"" me was

Again, you don't need to do drugs to be 'unreal' or 'inauthentic' or even to wonder if you are the real you. There are plenty of stories people tell that are centered around this 'authenticity/inauthenticity' thing. The woman who realizes a relationship isn't for her, and finds herself just acting the part before realizing she isn't being true to herself. The man who busts his ass working, only to realize he's working towards nothing, and is only doing it due to conventional norms rather than any desire or gratification. Even one of the [Star Wars trailers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGbxmsDFVnE) starts with the three characters asking questions about who they are and who they want to be.  

I think /u/SamanthadelValle makes a very good point that 'drugs' here is messy and we need to think more clearly about what sort of altering is sufficient for you to lose your 'real self' (if you have one, that is). /u/ileroykid makes a few good points, but the schizophrenia remark is especially noteworthy, I think. I'm not exactly sure what is like to have schizophrenia, but I'd guess based on what others have said that there is for some people schizophrenia actively harms and goes against certain interests and desires these people have. If a self is a person with a fairly consistent set of desires, and a consistent set of goals and interests, and is in general stable, then schizophrenia (and other mental disorders/diseases/illnesses) may be an obstacle to selfhood, or at least a rich selfhood.

None of this is meant to suggest that you ought to be taking adderall, by the way. Chances are there are more reasons than authenticity for why you weren't having a good time -- physical side effects, how others treated you knowing you were on the drugs."
645,AskPhilosophy,How is Guy Debord perceived within the philosophical discourse?,"So while the Situationists are probably less influential generally in 21st century thought than the Frankfurt School, it's also important to speak of where these groups are read. Adorno is read in Universities, Debord is read in squats and in *zone à défendre*. My head of department at my old uni was a Adorno scholar, while groups taking up the thought of the situationists like Tiqqun and The Invisible Committee spent most of the past decade battling to avoid prison over accusations of railway sabotage. 

As to whether the Situationist approach to Marxism has had much influence,  I think they have had a much greater influence over Anarchist and similar ultra left groups, which demonstrates something I suppose."
646,AskPhilosophy,How do I avoid misinterpretations and misrepresentations of Philosophies and Philosophers?,"I've split my advice into two sections, as I think there's two parts to this. The first is when you're reading or learning of a philosopher, and the second is when you're asked to 'represent' a philosophy or philosophy in public or in an essay.

&#x200B;

**Reading/Getting to grips with an author**

1) Read genuinely, with good faith, and ideally twice – once skimming, and not too bothered about getting it 'right', then do a proper read to understand each paragraph. 

2) Take advantage of the introductions of great authors – they're designed to introduce and prime you to learn what someone is saying, rather than interpret the text for you in a specific way (with some exceptions for late Continental authors, who it's very hard to read without interpreting).

3) Read the context of an author – frankly, that can be wikipedia in some cases, as much as people will hate me for saying that. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is also good, as is IETP. Scholarly articles and history books are great of course, but obviously longer and varying quality. Machiavelli makes more sense knowing the context of 15th century Italy, even if his message is timeless (sorry Straussians who may disagree with me). 

4) Read what great scholars of that author have to say about what the author thinks. Reading Seyla Benhabib, Etienne Balibar, and Serena Parekh's views of Arendt are what gives you a masterful understanding of Arendt, above reading her primary work. This requires understanding *who* the great authors are, but knowing (2) and (3) helps you do (4). If you don't understand where they're coming from, pin down the bit where they ""lose"" you, and drill into that.

Doing all this means you've read the main texts at least twice, multiple supporting authors, and a history of the person you're studying. At that point, you've done the groundwork to understand an issue.

Keep in mind reading is ***hard***. It's not like reading fiction – you're *studying*, and studying tough texts. Take time, don't expect to get the answer immediately, and assume you're standing on the shoulders of giants. Great authors have written crap (Plato's rants about Phyrgian music come to mind), but great texts are great for a reason, and you're much more likely to not 'get' something than you are to have found an insightful new criticism.

&#x200B;

**Writing/Expressing your View**

1) Follow PEARL in your essay-writing: Point, evidence, analysis, reference, link. Point is a short statement of what you're saying the author says. Evidence is a primary quote. Analysis is explaining in your own modern short words what the author says. Reference is a secondary source which reinforces what you're saying, giving you a clue of the overall context. And link brings it back to your original point. For (a rushed) example:

>*Arendt is sceptical of human rights' ability to protect one's liberty. In* Origins of Totalitarianism*, Arendt says clearly that human rights are the rights of those with ""the loss of home and political status"". That means they're the rights of those without a polity to defend their rights – for Arendt, the source of human rights. As Serena Parekh says,* “human rights rights are for when civil rights have failed” *- Parekh is saying only those without protection, rely on human rights. And that protection, for Arendt, necessarily comes from belonging to a polity, i.e. from political status. This reinforces my overall thesis: statism is essential to Arendt's politics. Her scepticism of human rights is part of her belief in the essential nature of the state.*

Writing simply in PEARL means you're forcing yourself to stick to the original source tightly. You can of course write differently and well, and writing in PEARL doesn't mean you're writing truth, but it forces you to continually refer to primary and secondary sources. 

As a note, PEARL doesn't lend itself to disagreeing with sources, i.e. writing 'John says X; I say Y'. There's other kinds of writing styles PEARL doesn't lend itself towards. But for the majority of ideas, writing in PEARL is helpful.

2) Put in three points what an author is saying in a text. Everything can be simplified into bullet point lists no more than 5-7 points long, and everything can be oversimplified into three key ideas. This is a judgment exercise, but doing so distils an author down and gives you a point of reference to make sure you're consistent in your interpretation of an author, which helps you avoid misinterpretation – most misinterpretation from students at all levels are revealed by inconsistency (John says Hobbes says x; that maybe makes sense in passage y, but what about passage z?). So avoiding inconsistency through summarising an author's points, is immensely helpful.

3) Talk to your peers! While lecturers and professors will tell you very often, ""it depends"", your peers will often go ""this bit makes \*\*\*\* all sense"", or have a view to what an author is saying in passage Y, that is a gross oversimplification *that gives a clear view to what an author says*. You don't need to be perfect in an interpretation, just in the right ballpark – you don't need to get Hobbes' theory of statehood exactly right, as long as you know he is very staunchly in favour of the state for stability. Academics argue endlessly about the exact right interpretation of authors; your job is to get it *roughly* right, i.e. *not objectively wrong*. Do that by talking to your peers, and getting validation that your interpretation isn't mad.

647,AskPhilosophy,"In my understanding of existentialism, man is meant to live authentically and adhere to his own moral code. Therefore is it justified for a man to kill another or commit some sort of crime because it is what he thinks is right?","The main work of Existentialist ethics is de Beauvoir's *The Ethics of Ambiguity*. She suggests that, no, one ought not to go around being a shithead, which includes not murdering people, because the freedom of others provides the basis for a moral system which rules out (among other things) murder. Sartre (another key Existentialist) agreed with de Beauvoir."
648,AskPhilosophy,What did Camus think about Nietzsche's will to power?,"I'm just a philosophy hobbyist, but I don't believe Nietzsche saw the will to power as a ""purpose."" He describes it as a fact about the way we are -- possibly the way all living things are. It can be recognized for what it is and bent to one's own purposes, whatever those may be. The important thing is to be free of the illusion that we are mostly rational beings so that we can have intentional, clear-eyed interactions with the (usually subconscious) drives that shape most of our nature and cause most of our actions.

Nietzsche suggests that we should be able to shape our lives and give them purpose, which is similar to Camus, but lacking the feeling of futility and absurdity."
649,AskPhilosophy,"In the Myth of Sisyphus, Albert camus says ""The absurd has meaning only in so far as it is not agreed to."" What is meant by this?","My interpretation of the sentence is that Camus is asserting that the meaning that has been applied to the absurd by the individual is only valid if it has been arrived to independently, i.e., created, not simply adopted or agreed to. 

If one simply adopts or agrees to an external framework of meaning for the absurd, they are inherently signing away portions of their experience for the convenience of having a premade edifice of meaning, rather than one that is tailored to each nook and cranny of their soul, forged through direct confrontation with the absurdity of experience."
650,AskPhilosophy,I can't afford to pay Jstor $18 for every article I don't have access to. What's the best way to pirate philosophy?,"To second /u/thenaterator: most libraries have an option to request papers through inter-library loan if your library does not already have a copy, and many libraries will scan .pdfs of journals that they hold on the shelves. (Some have a formal option to do this. Sometimes it just takes a nice email or a box of chocolates to the right person).

No matter what you do, you should get in touch with the reference librarian in charge of philosophy at your library. Librarians love to help, and summer is the least busy time for them. If there's a way to make this work at your library, they'll find it for you.

Another great option is to look at the website of the author. At least 50% of the time, recent journal articles will be linked for free off of the authors' website. They'll say ""penultimate draft"" or some other bs, but they're the genuine article for any purpose less than explicit citation. 

If it's not on the author's website, try a google search for the exact title of the article. And check sites like philpapers.com and academia.edu for copies.

Another option is to email the author of the paper and (briefly!) explain your plight. Philosophers love to talk about their work, and remember what it was like to be a poor broke student. Many will be happy to send you a copy of their work.

A last-ditch legal option is that many databases now allow you to ""rent"" papers for 24-hours for something on the order of $6-7. And if you're renting a lot of them, chances are that (a) your parents or family might pay for some; (b) the billing department might be willing to give you a discount.

Bordering into the illegal, the next best thing to do would be to go to the closest in-state library and log on to a computer there. This computer should have online JSTOR access. Download some .pdfs of papers that you want, and email them to yourself. Librarians have to stop you if they catch you (it's breach of contract) but they don't really care as long as you're not too obvious.

Still in the realm of the illegal: find a friend who has good VPN access to JSTOR and other databases. Have them download the papers for you.

651,AskPhilosophy,"What parts of ""Existentialism is a Humanism"" did Sartre repudiate?","I'm unsure of *specific and overt* segments that Sartre regretted the most or outwardly repudiated, as if there was just a paragraph he wanted to remove.

From [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/), 

>“Existentialism is a Humanism,” delivered to an enthusiastic Parisian crowd October 28, 1945. Though taken as a quasi manifesto for the Existentialist movement, the transcript of this lecture was the only publication that Sartre openly regretted seeing in print. And yet it continues to be the major introduction to his philosophy for the general public. One of the reasons both for its popularity and for his discomfort is the clarity with which it exhibits the major tenets of existentialist thought while revealing Sartre's attempt to broaden its social application in response to his Communist and Catholic critics. In other words, it offers us a glimpse of Sartre's thought “on the wing.”

Basically, we have to remember that this was a speech given to a more general audience than philosophical academia. There will be simplifications because of this. As the SEP article states, it was ""on the wing,"" and some of the criticisms and flaws of EIAH is that it still presupposes a level of freedom not necessarily argued for *in* EIAH, among other things. Stated here:

> Sartre's thesis is that freedom is the implicit object of any choice, a claim he makes but does not adequately defend in his Humanism lecture. He seems to assume that “freedom” is the aspect under which any choice is made, its “formal object,” to revive an ancient term.


However, what I linked from SEP isn't sourced. But I was taught about this as well in my undergrad studies. I believe Sartre's ""repudiation"" for EIAH mainly comes about once it was put into print (from a spoken lecture) where it does not stand as a complete, well-argued, and established piece of literature."
652,AskPhilosophy,What does Kierkegaard mean with regret?,"This is written from the point of view of the Aesthete, someone who lives entirely for pleasure. From the point of view of pleasure, each decision is a missed opportunity for a different kind of pleasure. You'll find some pleasure in marrying, but you'll miss out on some other pleasures by doing so. Due to this, every choice is meaningless and thus cause for regret.

Kierkegaard paints this as being very different from decisions made in the ethical realm. Once in the ethical, we choose based on certain principles, and those principles guide us to do what is right. In that scenario our choices become meaningful and we are no longer plagued with regret, for even if there was pleasure in the other option, we did what was good, and thus we are satisfied. The life of pleasure seeking is characterized by this kind of regret, for Kierkegaard, whereas he characterizes the ethical life as being made up of meaningful choice."

654,AskPhilosophy,"What does Albert Camus mean by ""Beginning to think is beginning to be undermined"" in Myth of Sisyphus?","Camus immediately says that:

&#x200B;

>In a sense, and as in melodrama, killing yourself amounts to confessing. It is confessing that life is too much for you or that you do not understand it.  
>  
>Living, naturally, is never easy. You continue making the gestures commanded by existence for many reasons, the first of which is habit. Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering.

&#x200B;

Camus argues that life is meaningless, or that if it has meaning, it is impossible for us to find it because of our limited faculties. Thus, when we try to find meaning, we quickly realize the futility of our endeavors, and a process of undermining starts. The more you try to see things (actions, persons, objects, etc) as meaningful, the more you realize they are not, and you realize the absurdity of your everyday life. 

&#x200B;

As a sort of side note, I always liked how Zappfe in his essay The Last Man portrayed more or less the same but in a very pessimist way:

 

>Whatever happened? A breach in the very unity of life, a biological paradox, an abomination, an absurdity, an exaggeration of disastrous nature. Life had overshot its target, blowing itself apart. A species had been armed too heavily – by spirit made almighty without, but equally a menace to its own well-being. Its weapon was like a sword without hilt or plate, a two-edged blade cleaving everything; but he who is to wield it must grasp the blade and turn the one edge toward himself.  
>  
>Despite his new eyes, man was still rooted in matter, his soul spun into it and subordinated to its blind laws. And yet he could see matter as a stranger, compare himself to all phenomena, see through and locate his vital processes. He comes to nature as an unbidden guest, in vain extending his arms to beg conciliation with his maker: Nature answers no more, it performed a miracle with man, but later did not know him. He has lost his right of residence in the universe, has eaten from the Tree of Knowledge and been expelled from Paradise. He is mighty in the near world, but curses his might as purchased with his harmony of soul, his innocence, his inner peace in life’s embrace.

655,AskPhilosophy,Do anthropomorphized terms trick people into thinking AI is different from what it really is?,"Hi there, Computer Scientist / Philosopher here. AI isn't so much a *thing* as it is a study. AI is the study of the creation of ""intelligent"" computer programs, which usually ends up meaning ""computer programs that can perform tasks indicative of intelligence in human analogs."" We (computer scientists and philosophers) don't really have a good definition of intelligence that isn't in some way related to our own intelligence; so when someone states a machine has intelligence, they're usually using some rehashing of the Turing test. When computer scientists make claims about the intelligence of a program, we aren't saying anything about the computer's *inner life* - we aren't suggesting it has consciousness - we are merely claiming it performs a complex task that humans are good at with accuracy and speed approaching that of a human.


The major linguistic problem is that, since we're making the word ""intelligence"" do double duty, people typically assume that brains and computers are functionally analogous. There are, of course, strong arguments against this conceptual model, the foremost being the capabilities we as humans lack, which are trivial for computers orders of magnitude less powerful than our human brains. As a quick demonstration, try to read a chapter of your favorite book with the sole intention of remembering it precisely, and then attempt to load it from your memory, much as a computer would load text from a hard drive. Plainly, our brains do not work like computers (or, at least, the kinds of computers we’re used to). But since we're so used to the computational theory of mind, and speaking of our brains as if they are computers (and vice versa, with CS terms like ""neural nets"") it becomes very easy to conflate the two and believe that the brain is just a computer programmed in a certain way that we can eventually mimic.


It seems obvious that our memory works nothing like a computer's, otherwise we would all be regularly quoting Shakespeare at each other, but we do indeed often talk as if our fuzzy recollections are similar in kind. There is almost nothing linking the programming of a Rush Hour heuristic (something I've done) to a human being solving a Rush Hour puzzle, aside from the outcome, yet that's something us computer scientists would absolutely term ""AI."" People run wild with AI because it's a sensational story, but we're nowhere close to building conscious machines - we still don't even know what consciousness is.


TL;DR: Yes, yes, a million times yes. It's one part sensational media, one part things people don't understand, and one part overloaded terms.

656,AskPhilosophy,Why is Nietzche important?,"Some of the other answers here are a bit myopic, focusing on his influence on such and such academic philosopher. If someone isn't familiar with this world, I don't think these answers are helpful. Rattling off words like *Post-post-structuralist* and *methodological* is completely missing the point of the question.

Instead, I'll put it simply. Nietzsche is important because he was one of the first philosophers to recognize and write about the ""crisis"" of Western modernity. Specifically the situation in which people profess to believe in Christianity, yet actually don't at a deeper level. This is what the famous ""God is dead"" quote is about: Western civilization has spent ±2,000 years building an edifice that is rapidly crumbling. 

Even though Nietzsche disliked Christianity, he thought this erosion and loss of a firm worldview would lead to nihilism and other crises. In a very simplified sense, his books are an attempt to both understand the situation (*Genealogy of Morality, Beyond Good and Evil*) and propose solutions to it (*Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, the concept of the Übermensch.) This is also why he is generally considered a proto-Existentalist, although I personally don't think this is an accurate label, as I don't quite buy the individualist reading of Nietzsche.

If you're totally new to Nietzsche, I would start by reading *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* and *On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life.* The former is a narrative written in a quasi-Biblical style and conveys some of his ideas in short narrative form, while the latter is an essay that questions a basic assumption of the modern world (that knowledge of the past is always good.) I'd say they both give a good overview of Nietzsche's ideas and style."
657,AskPhilosophy,"Is 'Eric The God-Eating Penguin' ""dilemma"" incoherent and contradictory sophistry?","It's no good as an argument, and it trades on a misunderstanding both of the ontological argument and about the nature of God. In particular, it doesn't appreciate that God is meant to exist necessarily: it's meant not to be a contingent fact whether God exists or not, but a necessary truth about existence. 

The point of the penguin argument is that if all that was required for something to exist was to include necessary existence part of the definition of something, then we could define all kinds of things into existence. This is true. However, that is not the way the ontological argument is meant to work. The ontological argument is meant to work by leveraging our understanding of how the universe is meant to be in its most fundamental nature--in Anselm's case, as flowing from some primordial source of existence--and we can see from that understanding of the fundamental nature that the existence of God is a necessary truth. Whether the Anselm-style argument succeeds or not depends on what the necessary truths are of the world, not of what sentences we can string together and be understood.

You may retort that we can say that Eric is necessarily god-eating, but this misses the point. This is to work upwards from some arbitrary assignment of properties (being a penguin, eating things, having gods as its diet). But the way we are meant to learn about God (insofar as we can) in the Anselm-style arguments is downwards from the most fundamental facts: there is existence, there is order, etc. It goes entirely the other way round.

One reason for the confusion about the ontological argument is that people think this is meant to be a proof for the conception of God they are familiar with: the god of the old and new testaments, who made a covenant with Abraham, is the godhead of which Jesus is a part, is the target of worship by the Christian church, etc. But the argument doesn't pretend to establish any of that. These are properties of the kind that Eric the god-eating penguin has: particular contingent facts. The argument at most can establish the most high-level things we can say about God: that there is a source for any existence and any goodness at all, and God is necessarily that source. This doesn't tell us any of the particulars of God, and many people have spent many centuries wondering about to what extent we can even talk about God having particulars or us knowing about them even in the firm conviction that there is a godhead that is the source for our existence and of the goodness in the world."
658,AskPhilosophy,Is God/Jesus the platonic form of a human?,"It's not clear that there is a Platonic Form of a human, at least in the proper sense of a Form.  

In Plato's dialogue *Parmenides*, where a young Socrates tries to defend his nascent Theory of Forms (more aptly described as a relatively mature version of Plato's Theory of Forms) against a merciless Eleatic challenge, we get this fascinating exchange...

>Socrates, he said, I admire the bent of your mind towards philosophy; tell me now, was this your own distinction between ideas in themselves and the things which partake of them? and do you think that there is an idea of likeness apart from the likeness which we possess, and of the one and many, and of the other things which Zeno mentioned?
I think that there are such ideas, said Socrates.
Parmenides proceeded: And would you also make absolute ideas of the just and the beautiful and the good, and of all that class?
Yes, he said, I should.
**And would you make an idea of man apart from us and from all other human creatures, or of fire and water?
I am often undecided, Parmenides, as to whether I ought to include them or not.**
And would you feel equally undecided, Socrates, about things of which the mention may provoke a smile?-I mean such things as hair, mud, dirt, or anything else which is vile and paltry; would you suppose that each of these has an idea distinct from the actual objects with which we come into contact, or not?
Certainly not, said Socrates. 

So, ""Likeness,"" ""the Just,"" ""the Beautiful,"" and ""the Good"" are definitely good candidates for Forms.  There apparently is no form of ""hair"" or ""mud"" and the forms of ""human"" along with all the material elements are dicey.

We might begin to understand this by recognizing that the forms are always abstract universal ideas, with concrete particular things being the ""lesser"" sorts of beings that merely participate in forms.  The form of a human, as in an individual human, seems more particular than universal.  For this reason alone, we might be hesitant to think there is a Form of Human.  If there was such a Form, it seems more likely that it would be something more like a form of *Humanity* than an ideal individual human.

We also get somewhat of a clue in the grouping of ""human"" with the material elements in *Parmenides.*  In the account of Plato's Theory of Forms found in *Republic* VI (with the ""Divided Line"") we are told that there are intelligible things that might seem form-ish, but are not quite the Forms.  Specifically, those abstract ideas that are inextricably tangled up in sensation and materiality are a different class of things than the forms, known through *dianoesis* rather than *episteme.*   These might be on the way to coming to know the forms, but they aren't quite there.  The Forms, properly speaking, must be completely abstract.  

Thus, a ""form of water, earth, fire, or air"" seemingly can't be a proper capital-F ""Form.""  These are abstractions taken from sense experience and some sort of materiality appears to be essential to them.  An individual human seems to necessarily be something material, in addition to individual and particular.  For this reason, we should be hesitant to suppose such a Form.

This significantly complicates the account of the immortality of the soul given in *Phaedo* and other places.  If there is such a thing as an immortal human soul, and if it is a Form (or at least significantly like a Form), it's probably not an individual human.

I think it is overwhelmingly likely that Plato would have regarded Jesus as an exemplary human and a beacon of virtue (after all - the similarities to his portrayal of Socrates are too striking to overlook).  If this is what your question was asking after, then I suppose the answer is ""yes.""  But the question seems to touch on something deeper and way more complicated.  The very notion of a Form of Human is tricky all by itself.  Things get even more complicated when we start trying to figure out whether Christ is an individual person and what the relation between the parts of the Trinity are."
659,AskPhilosophy,"Why is it that Eastern and Western philosophy don't appear to have interacted much, even in the ancient world, until the 19th century? Is there any evidence of cross pollination of ideas?","Alexander the Great's campaigns in India are the best place to look as they occurred during a flourishing philosophical era in India. Legend says that Alexander turned back at the prospect of facing the Maurya Empire's war elephants. Emperor Ashoka was instrumental in spreading Buddhism across the world and his stone edicts are some of our earliest sources on Buddhism. In [one edict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_Bilingual_Rock_Inscription), Ashoka proclaims his progress at spreading the dharma in Greek and Aramaic. 

The Greeks encountered what they called *gymnosophists* or 'naked philosophers'. One school of Jainism has monks who go nude but the term was used to refer to Indian ascetics/monks in general. This interaction lead to the development of [Greco-Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhism). Many of our most famous icons of the Buddha are done in the Greco-Buddhist style. Some tidbits from that article that may be interesting:

According to Diogenes Laertius, Phyrro accompanied Alexander to India where he picked up Buddhist ideas of equanimity and detachment. I wonder where Alexander found someone who spoke both Greek and Sanskrit.

There was also likely influence on early Christianity. The substantial similarity between Buddhist and Catholic/Orthodox monasticism leads some to speculate on connections but I haven't seen anything conclusive. Clement of Alexandria mentions the Buddha by name."
660,AskPhilosophy,"Did Nietzsche mean 'amor fati' in a constant sense, for example that one should smile or laugh at any tragedy currently befalling them, or in an overarching sense whereby one should learn to see the beauty in suffering but still feel suffering all the same?","There are probably more qualified people on here to answer this than me, but i would think he meant it in the latter sense. If you laughed at every tragedy and every bit of horribleness that life threw at you, one would get the sense that you were only laughing because you weren't accepting that what was happening to you is real. For example, imagine i'm a committed father who loves his children and then one day, while they're crossing the street they get brutally killed by a careless driver. Trying to force some inapproprite, positive feeling into my mind at this moment would be very strange indeed, and it might be a sign that i am distancing myself from the gravity of the event which has just transpired. Because i'm not accurately processing these event, you can't really say i'm loving my fate.

In the latter sense of amor fati which you described, i would have dealt with my hypothetical child's death by realizing the gravity of the event and accepting the horrible emotions that come with knowing your son/daughter has died. But all the while, i would maintain a sort of raw, rebellious embrace of life, in which i would revel in the pain and see it as empowering. So yes, Nietzsche would encourage you to feel the suffering while still retaing some kind of embrace of life, with all the tragedy and passion that goes along with it."
661,AskPhilosophy,Alan Watts speaks of a conflict between man and nature. That we actively dominate nature because we cannot accept that we are a result of nature. Are there philosophers that examine this resistance to our place in nature?,"The conflict between man and nature is pretty much the core of Adornos philosophy. For him nature is the *nonidentical*. Human rationality (= enlightment) is the act of determining, identifying, synthesizing, subsuming. In the primal age, nature is dominant over man, he is struggling in a world of absolute non-identity. When the human subject emerges as a rational agent, it reproduces this logic of domination and starts a historical process of rationality that doesn't stop until the last bit of non-identity is determined. This results in the total domination of nature. and a state where the subject undermines itself. Since it's fundamental task is the act of determination, if there is nothing nonidentical left to determine, it starts running on empty formalisms. So, with nothing nonidentical left, true enlightment also becomes impossible. In order to rescue both man and nature, the object, the nonidentical needs to emancipated from man. While having any kind of society requires domination over nature in the form of identification, the task is to not turn this into a blind formalism, the autonomy of *some* absolute nonidentity needs to established so subject and object can coexist in a state that does not reproduce the logic of total domination and makes possible true enlightment."
662,AskPhilosophy,Why is the philosophy of Nietzsche so easy to get wrong? What is his philosophy really about and what is the best way to get a better understanding of his philosophy?,"One thing to stop and consider is, being as charitable as possible to Nietzsche, why do you think he chose to write in such a manner? Why parables, prose, riddles and aphorisms and not straightforward explicit argumentation? A great deal of Nietzsche's thought involves criticism of our blind acceptance of the value of Truth, and of what he calls the ""will to Truth."" What is it that makes us so concerned about making certain that we understand the truth of Nietzsche's thought? 

In other words - one can see (and many have, in a variety of different ways) Nietzsche's style as a natural and perhaps even necessary extension of the content of his philosophical concerns and criticisms. Nietzsche is not needlessly complicated - he is merely using the tools available to him, i.e. textual strategies, to implement and convey his substantive concerns.

My recommendation is to simply keep reading him - read him broadly. Read all of his works, see how they play off of each other, converse with each other, and negate each other. Take your time, don't necessarily trust him - Nietzsche is not always speaking from his own mouth. He uses characters and personas. Just like how Shakespeare (or Plato) might use a mask to convey a point that they later reveal or mock as a farce, Nietzsche will do the same.

Perhaps most importantly, try not to read Nietzsche expecting that at any time you will come to some explicit final understanding of *his* thoughts on how to live a good life. If anything, his writing will beat this drive out of you. 

Good luck and enjoy! "
663,AskPhilosophy,Was Aristotle an advocate for the welfare state?,"Take a look at Aristotle's comments in Book VII when he discusses ways of minimizing crime within the state as well as wars with neighbors.  This book begins with a question about the equalization of property and the positions of Phaleas and Plato.  What Aristotle is doing in this passage is both affirming Phaleas' general worry and then critiquing Phaeleas' application.  He goes on to worry that Phaleas' process works best on small cities, but will create problems with larger ones.  

This is not the whole bit, but a part which goes directly to the point:

> **There are crimes of which the motive is want; and for these Phaleas
expects to find a cure in the equalization of property, which will
take away from a man the temptation to be a highwayman, because he
is hungry or cold.** But want is not the sole incentive to crime; men
also wish to enjoy themselves and not to be in a state of desire-
they wish to cure some desire, going beyond the necessities of life,
which preys upon them; nay, this is not the only reason- they may
desire superfluities in order to enjoy pleasures unaccompanied with
pain, and therefore they commit crimes. 

> **Now what is the cure of these three disorders? Of the first, moderate
possessions and occupation**; of the second, habits of temperance; as
to the third, if any desire pleasures which depend on themselves,
they will find the satisfaction of their desires nowhere but in philosophy;
for all other pleasures we are dependent on others. The fact is that
the greatest crimes are caused by excess and not by necessity. Men
do not become tyrants in order that they may not suffer cold; and
hence great is the honor bestowed, not on him who kills a thief, but
on him who kills a tyrant. Thus we see that the institutions of Phaleas
avail only against petty crimes. 

> **The equalization of property is one of the things that tend to prevent
the citizens from quarrelling.** Not that the gain in this direction
is very great. For the nobles will be dissatisfied because they think
themselves worthy of more than an equal share of honors; and this
is often found to be a cause of sedition and revolution. And the avarice
of mankind is insatiable; at one time two obols was pay enough; but
now, when this sum has become customary, men always want more and
more without end; for it is of the nature of desire not to be satisfied,
and most men live only for the gratification of it. The beginning
of reform is not so much to equalize property as to train the nobler
sort of natures not to desire more, and to prevent the lower from
getting more; that is to say, they must be kept down, but not ill-treated.
**Besides, the equalization proposed by Phaleas is imperfect; for he
only equalizes land, whereas a man may be rich also in slaves, and
cattle, and money, and in the abundance of what are called his movables.
Now either all these things must be equalized, or some limit must
be imposed on them, or they must an be let alone.** It would appear
that Phaleas is legislating for a small city only, if, as he supposes,
all the artisans are to be public slaves and not to form a supplementary
part of the body of citizens. But if there is a law that artisans
are to be public slaves, it should only apply to those engaged on
public works, as at Epidamnus, or at Athens on the plan which Diophantus
once introduced."
664,AskPhilosophy,Were there any famous female philosophers in Ancient Greece?,"We largely don't have writings from them, but some are mentioned, for instance: Diotima, who supposedly taught Socrates and to whom is attributed his teachings in the *Symposium*; and Hypatia, who is famous from Carl Sagan's *Cosmos* and related pseudo-history but was a legitimate historical figure working in the Neoplatonic context in late antiquity."
665,AskPhilosophy,"What should I read before reading ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra""?","Have fun! Honestly, I think it's easy to put too much value on having the 'correct' preparation. Any philosophy text presupposes so many others that you're never going to feel fully prepared. The Zarathustra especially is just a weird, weird text, and no amount of preparation is going to make it not weird on first reading.  
If I were you, I would just start reading. Read with care, see what you get and what you don't. Then go and read other stuff, for its own sake, and come back to the *Zarathustra* when you've learned more. You'll probably get more out of it the second time, but only because you already did it the first time!"
666,AskPhilosophy,"This may be very odd, but is there a philosophy of frolicking?","You probably mean with ""frolicking"" a short time of happiness felt by an individual.

If that's what you mean you should have a look at the ancient philosopher Aristippos (don't know his name in English). He was a student of Socrates and believed to be the first one to write an essay about happiness and anger of the soul while also being one of the ""founder"" of hedonism.

Philosophers like Epicur or Seneca wrote a lot about personal happiness too, and while both have similar views, they choose to take different paths. Both acknowledge that peace, luck and happiness can only be found within one self and we should not look for it in our environment. Still, both recommend different methods.

In modern times especially John Mill and Kant would come to my mind. 

Mill is literally the father of utilitarism and wrote that actions are right in a sense of moral, if they maximize happiness, while they are wrong if they minimize happiness. 

Kant should be widely known, especially for his writings about moral and virtue. His believes about inner peace and happiness are similar to the ones of the Stoics."
667,AskPhilosophy,What is the state of Hegelian dialectics in contemporary philosophy?,"Hegel’s legacy continues throughout most of ‘Continental’ thought, whether that is in Hegelian Marxists like Žižek, cultural theorists like Judith Butler or Fredric Jameson, or the tradition of the Frankfurt School (Honneth, Habermas, etc). In one way or another, nearly every Continental thinker has been influenced by Hegel, whether directly or indirectly.

Interestingly, analytic philosophy has also become increasingly interested in Hegel in the past few decades. The ‘Pittsburgh Hegelians’ - Sellars, McDowell, and Brandom - are all incredibly influential in contemporary analytic philosophy, and have all conducted their work on the basis of an interpretation of Hegel. You can read a review of a book on the Pittsburgh Hegelians here: https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/analytic-philosophy-and-the-return-of-hegelian-thought/"
668,AskPhilosophy,How Do I Begin to Study Philosophy?,Look at [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/4ifqi3/im_interested_in_philosophy_where_should_i_start/).
669,AskPhilosophy,Conservative anti-capitalism?,"Patrick J Deneen's Why Liberalism Failed comes to mind - in the book he critiques liberalism as an inherently flawed ideology partly from a 'conservative' angle regarding its social politics (selling his viewpoint short here but it works) and from an economic angle too, arguing that free-market capitalism erodes the traditional social bonds that conservatives seek to defend."
670,AskPhilosophy,Is it evil to crush a spider?,"Entomologist Jeffrey Lockwood argued for a ""minimum ethic"" when dealing with insects (yes I know spiders aren't insects but the point is equally relevant). Paraphrased, ""We should avoid killing or causing serious pain to insects, if doing so has no (or trivial) cost to our own welfare.""

In this framework, it seems as though the morality of killing a spider will depend on the degree to which the spider threatens your welfare. Is it venomous? Is it on someone? Is it extremely psychologically distressing?

I should also stress that this is a proposed *minimum* ethic. It seems reasonable that there may be further moral restrictions on killing a spider that should be considered. Ecological concerns might prevent us from morally killing a spider, for instance. 

Many of the most prominent philosophers of animal ethics, like Tom Regan and Robin Attfield, seem to prescribe moral duty to animals in general based on their capacity for things like having interests and subjective experience. The difficulty then becomes judging the degree to which a spider can be said to meet those criteria. 

If you find killing a spider morally distressing because of the mere fact that it is a living creature, you might consider looking into Jainist and Buddhist ethics. Vegetarian and Vegan moral philosophy will probably also be useful, if only tangentially related."
671,AskPhilosophy,Does philosophy improve mathematical ability?,"The best improvement I had in mathematics that can be traced to philosophical training is in the Logic courses I've taken. 

Some may object that those courses *are* mathematics, and it's therefore obvious that they improve mathematical reasoning.

However, I'd like to add the following: I noticed a certain ease to solve mathematical problems after I started writing down proofs as philosophical arguments. That is, text mixed with strictly mathematical symbols. 

Perhaps this had nothing to do with it, but I think my training in reasoning with purely textual demonstrations (which is something I poured over in my Modern Philosophy courses, for example, when reading Spinoza, or when studying scholasticism) carried over to mathematics when I started doing that.

So my answer is as such: an exercise in philosophy not necessarily leads to an improvement in mathematical skill, but if you highlight the similarities between the disciplines, I think it can.

As to the other question… very unlikely that there are techniques useful in a subject that are not acquired from the discipline itself. 

Maybe the converse is true: that there are philosophically useful skills acquired from other disciplines; mathematics included. Again, look at Spinoza and Descartes borrowing the Euclidean style of axiomatic demonstration for metaphysics."
672,AskPhilosophy,"Why does Kant deny moral worth to actions motivated by emotion (love, sympathy etc)?",">Why does Kant deny moral worth to actions motivated by emotion (love, sympathy etc)?

He argues that motivation by emotion is correct only by accident: it can just as easily lead people astray. If you do something because you love someone, you might do the right thing, but you might also do the wrong thing, like if you murder ten people to buy a fancy cake for your children because you love your children.

>What I don't understand is the implication that your actions are of more moral worth if you absolutely hate completing them than if you have cultivated your character to enjoy them? 

He doesn't say this. He just says that if you hate doing it then we can be pretty sure you're doing it for the right reasons. This doesn't mean your action has more moral worth than someone who does it for the right reason and who also enjoys it. Indeed he says we have a duty to cultivate our enjoyment of moral actions, because this makes it easier for us to act morally. We're not morally better merely by enjoying our right actions, though. You can't become a better person by becoming happier. You can only become a better person by doing the right thing for the right reasons.

>Is the implication here that very few things have actual moral worth and that we as a society are too generous in attributing ""moral rightness"" to things?

Nope! His general view is that it's hard to know our own motives, let alone the motives of others, so one ought not to be too judgmental.

>Also, I'm failing to understand the impact of this idea on the remainder of Kant's moral theory. Would there be any significant change if this aspect were to be removed, and acting in accordance with duty was given the same moral worth as acting from it?

Yes, this would fundamentally destroy the entire moral framework, leaving effectively nothing. Kant's morality is fundamentally based on reason, not emotion, and every moral duty is derived from, dependent on, and in a sense equivalent to reason. Moral duty is the necessity of action from respect for the moral law (as opposed to the option you're suggesting, emotion), and the faculty to act in accordance with representation of the moral law is will. The good will is the only thing good without qualification, and the entire morality is built out of that notion of a good will, which is necessarily built on rationality.

If a good will could be one which were based on inclination then one could be good without the faculty to act in accordance with representation of the moral law, i.e without reason, and thus there would be no notion of necessity or duty in the first place, and thus we wouldn't get the categorical imperative.

It works in the other direction, too: if you start from rationality (as opposed to your suggestion, emotion) you can derive the entirety of Kant's moral theory, because the notion of rationality entails undertaking the required means to achieve the desired ends, but desire cannot ground the notion of ends in themselves, and so for us to act rationally we must take rationality itself to be an end in itself.

Kant's moral project is in opposition to (among others) Hume's, which was based on emotion. Kant rejects Hume's moral project in almost as many ways as he can, which entails cutting out emotion from any role in grounding moral duty."
673,AskPhilosophy,How significant is consensus within the field of philosophy?,"You may be interested in the epistemology of disagreement. 

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disagreement/ 

Roughly, the philosophical question is how you should (rationally) respond if you find that someone intelligent disagrees with you about something. Relatedly, how you should (rationally) respond if you find that someone intelligent *agrees* with you? Should you take agreement as evidence for? Should you take disagreement as evidence against?  

You seem to be interested in a related issue. If there is a consensus among experts on an issue, should you take that as evidence for what they agree on? 

There are a lot of things to think about here. Here's one interesting part of the question you can think about. As the SEP discusses, it seems as if this depends on the discipline. Take a scientific question, for example. If a large group of scientists agreed about something, say, climate change, then it seems as if you should take that as evidence for climate change. In other words, the scientific consensus on climate change is *on its own* evidence for climate change. If you wanted to know about whether climate change is real, Googling to see that there is a consensus is good enough. However, take a moral question on the other hand. A consensus among ""moral experts"" alone would not be sufficient evidence. If you wanted to know whether torture is sometimes permissible, Googling the philosophical consensus would not be enough, and the consenus would not count as evidence."
674,AskPhilosophy,Is Plato's Republic seriously defended by academics today?,"Keep in mind that the topic of the dialogue is ""What is justice?"", and it's framed as a question of human virtue and the human soul. The discussion of the city is raised as an illustration or model of the analysis of the soul that the discussants are interested in. So the classes of the city are analogs of the parts of the soul, the civil virtues are analogs to moral virtues, the particular norm that (for example) each class in a city with civic virtue would tend to its own vocation rather than trying to perform the function of another class then illustrates (by analogy) the norm that each part of the soul should tend to its own natural function and not try to perform the function of another class (for instance, we should not try to make decisions with our emotions, but rather through calculation, and so on).

All of this remains of more than historical interest -- it is, for example, probably the founding document of virtue ethics, which remains a vital tradition on ethical reasoning.

So on a question like, ""Would anyone seriously defend the *Republic* today? I mean, it's Plato's political philosophy untenable?"" has to met with a challenge like, ""Hold on -- why are we taking the *Republic* to be a work of political philosophy?""

This isn't to say that the *Republic* has no relevant to political philosophy. But its relation to political philosophy is very much in question, as other comments have already noted."
675,AskPhilosophy,Why did consciousness evolve if free will doesn't exist?,"Contemporary interpretations of Comptabilism by figures like Daniel Dennett clarify that free will most certainly does exist within a deterministic universe. Your choices are the result of machinery reacting to input. Your free will is your experience of the mechanics. A machine is making the decisions, which makes it sound like they're not free — but you *are* the machine.

Your question will be clarified and more easily receive answers if you define precisely what you mean by consciousness along the linguistic division noted by Ned Block: ""Access Consciousness"" or ""Phenomenal Consciousness?""

Access Consciousness ('A-Consciousness') is essentially association: the processing of your raw qualia into comprehension. At instance *n* when you see a chair-like object, the action potentials from your optic nerves entering your brain's neural network travel along synaptic channels that were previously fired when receiving similar visual data from your optic nerves, and the neural network's output is that you comprehend the *n*-instance's chair as associated with other *n - x* instances of chair-like objects, which you have further associated with times that you spoke, read or wrote the word ""chair."" A-Consciousness is your associative and analogical ability to comprehend your present world in terms of your past world.

Phenomenal Consciousness ('P-Consciousness') is the raw feeling of experiencing. It's the movie that plays inside you. It's that you're *here, now*.

I think a good way to think about this difference is to consider hypothetical instances of A-Consciousness without P-Consciousness: ""Philosophical zombies."" The lights are on, but nobody's home. One real-life example is an AI neural network. Every time a human-made neural network takes input and classifies it, it's displaying A-Consciousness. But we have yet to see or understand how a neural network could ever develop P-Consciousness: that feeling of *being there.*

(My personal opinion, drawn from aforementioned Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter, is that A-Consciousness is a ""fundamental property"" of any mechanism that associates present input with previous input. P-Consciousness, well, who knows. Is an ant ""there?"")

EDIT: I should mention for completeness that Dennett's own position on P-consciousness is that it arises out of A-consciousness looped back on itself: when processing machines process their own changes in processing, which in turn depend on their surrounding environment that provides them input. Dennett does not believe in ""Philosophical zombies"" — he thinks that if a system develops in self-processing ability such that it walks and talks like a P-conscious being, then it is inherently a P-conscious being.  If the lights switch on depending on how the lights are switched on, somebody is home."
676,AskPhilosophy,Can we ever reeeaaalllyy understand the nature of reality? What theories explore this problem?,"You would definitely be interested in [Kant's transcendental idealism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-transcendental-idealism/).

It goes beyond the basic empiricism you described in your first paragraph.

To Kant, no we can't ""think outside of our own style of thinking"" because there are [certain categories](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/categories/#KanCon) that underpin how we think.

677,AskPhilosophy,How to explain to someone that anecdotes don't prove their point?,"Narratives are very convincing. Philosophy (as opposed to pure logic) is in part the practice of supplanting pure logic with logic + explanatory narrative. I would say that re-narrativising statistics is the way to go here.   


You say: ""statistically speaking, smoking is very dangerous. that's why i don't smoke.""  
Interlocutor: ""yeah, but both of my grandmothers smoked and they lived into their mid-90s""  


To respond, you need to do more than quote some statistics: you should make use of a similar anecdote (narrative) device to bring the point home.   


""Well, of course some people do just fine smoking. But, in the US almost 500 thousand people die annually from smoking related illnesses. Of those, I'm sure lots of them had grandparents lived long lives while still smoking. It's just not a risk I want to take""  


Statistics help us see the possible outcomes, anecdotes help us make possibilities tangible and personal."
678,AskPhilosophy,Why do Marxists (specifically french ones) like Spinoza so much ?,"Sorta. It makes most sense to interpret in its historical setting. Spinozism was brought to prominence by Althusser as an alternative to phenomenology and the aporias of critical philosophy. If anything, the resurgence of Spinozism in French philosophy was an attempt to recover the Hegelian framework. So in a sense you're right in thinking that some faith was placed in Spinoza as a materialist alternative to Hegel - something of especial value, given the immense utility of Hegel's philosophy in general. (Although not all scholars interpret Spinoza as a materialist).

The interest in Spinoza also transcends the historical situation of French philosophy though. Althusser writes about Spinoza from the standpoint of trying to recover objectivity and scientificity. Phenomenology always had an anti-science tendency since it attempted to investigate a non-(natural)-scientific realm, that is, of pure experience. To say that 'x is true' without needing to add a variety of qualifiers responding to historicist, Marxist, etc. critiques, we need to find some discourse that transcends the contingencies of historical, materially determined experience. Spinoza's philosophy promised one such opportunity.

Between Althusser and Badiou, we find a similar commitment to an ideal of absolute truth according to which we are capable supposedly of assenting to Marxism not just being a contingent idea, but a necessary and truthful theory. I'm not familiar with Lordon, but Deleuze is generally considered to be an exception to the French reception of Spinoza. Deleuze isn't interested in the same way as the others in transcendent truth, but in how the immanence of affect can render truth to us as immanent becoming. Turning to Spinoza, Deleuze was able to escape what was called in France the '3 Hs': Hegel, Husserl and Heidegger, which is why Spinoza features in Deleuze's unique history of philosophy, alongside Nietzsche, Bergson, Kant and Leibniz.

Basically, it's a common theme of his - that ""good/evil"" is in reality the reverse of what's good for humans (due to certain historical developments). ""Good"" is just a nasty moralization that runs counter to healthy, life-affirming behavior.

Hence, those who are ""good"" are dangerous and unhealthy.

It's easy to find places in his texts where it's brought out."
680,AskPhilosophy,"How did Descartes, Locke and Hume set the stage for Kant?","Descartes:

* People believe lots of things that are clearly wrong.
* Even our senses often deceive us. A stick in a glass of water looks bent, but we know it's really straight. That sort of thing, you know.
* And when we're asleep, we dream and don't even realize that we're dreaming. How do we know we're not just asleep right now? Hmm... I could just be dreaming right now. I could simply wake up, like the end of a bad movie, and find out 'it was all a dream'. 
* Hell, there could be some powerful demon, or some evil genius, playing elaborate tricks on me so that even when I try to just sit down and do a simple math problem, I *think* I'm getting the right answer, but just before I get to the end, he tricks me every time. 
* Now, these are getting increasingly implausible. But the point is, I *can* doubt the evidence of my senses. The sun looks like it goes around the earth, but it doesn't. And that stick in the glass of water. Pretty much everything *can* be doubted; I might believe with near-certitude that I'm typing on a computer right now. But, you know... the dreaming thing, and the evil genius...
* What do I know *for sure?* Only this: as a *thinking thing*, I exist — at least in the instant in which I *am* thinking. Even if I try to doubt that I exist as a thinking thing, *I* *am doubting*. That doubting mind exists, and I know this for certain because the mere act of doubting necessarily proves that the doubting occurs, and therefore that thinking happens, and thus that a thinking thing — the *I*, the subjective consciousness — exists.
* Fortunately, I also know for certain that God exists, and that God would not deceive me. So I can generally trust my senses — the evidence of my senses, as such, is fine; I just need to make sure I don't read anything into that evidence that's mistaken. Because all those errors come from *me* misapplying my reason. As long as I stick to only those ideas that I perceive *clearly* and *distinctly*, I'm good.
* Bottom line: 'First Philosophy' is *epistemology, not metaphysics*, and epistemology is grounded first and foremost in my absolute certainty that *I exist*, as a thinking thing. Mind and matter are absolutely distinct; and for a subjective consciousness like the 'I' that thinks, mind precedes matter.

Locke:

* We enter the world as absolutely empty vessels. Everything that exists in the mind got there by first *entering* our consciousness as a sense-perception. The external world is the source of all of our ideas. All ideas come from experience.
* Therefore, we can't really get behind or beyond those sense-perceptions. There is no 'innate knowledge,' in the end, *all* knowledge is empirical knowledge. Matter precedes mind.
* But the way that particles of matter interact with one another in the outside world, so do *simple ideas* interact with one another in the *inner space* of the mind. By *sensation*, the goings-on in 'outer' space are imprinted upon the soul and give rise to ideas. By *reflection*, the soul can combine various simple ideas into complex ones.
* Beyond our knowledge that we exist, which is indubitably certain; and that God exists, which is demonstrably certain; and certain truths of mathematics and morals, which we invent as ideal models to which other things must conform or not conform, and thus the ideals themselves have a kind of tautological certainty; all other knowledge is probable rather than certain.

Hume:

* We think we can arrive at knowledge by *induction*, but we are totally unjustified in this belief. Even our belief in cause and effect is just a habit of mind — we habitually see one action always followed by some other action, so we come to regard it that the first *causes* the second.
* But we don't even know what it would *mean* to know that one thing causes another thing. When one pool ball strikes another, and the second starts moving, does the motion of the first and the collision *cause* the motion of the second? If something *different* happened next time, that would seem to falsify my previous belief about the necessary causation of the latter by the former. And yet, there is no *reason* why it might not happen differently next time. Causation — and induction in general — are not certain knowledge; they are not even knowledge at all.
* Even the *self* itself isn't what we naively think it is. What is the self but a *bundle* of perceptions and sensations, matters of fact and relations of ideas? If you removed every perception and sensation and idea from the bundle, there is no ""self"" that would remain as an empty vessel. The self simply *is* the bundle.
* So the self, the subjective consciousness, is not a 'simple substance' — or, if it is, we don't *know* that it is and *can't* know that it is. Most of what has passed for philosophy up to the present is just metaphysical nonsense. Commit it to the flames.

Empiricist tradition — tends toward a nihilistic fatalism in which everything is *matter*.

* Bishop Berkeley — the idea of matter makes no sense.

Rationalist tradition — tends toward a solipsistic idealism in which everything is *mind*.

* Hume — this idea of mind makes no sense.

I don't know who it was, but some witty person or other is supposed to have remarked around this time, in response to these destructive tendencies: ""never mind; no matter.""

Kant:

* You're all right and you're all wrong. Both sides of any of these disputes can conclusively prove the other wrong, but can't really prove their own side right. It's a stalemate among seemingly irresolvable *antinomies*.
* The real problem is this: *you're all assuming that we have knowledge of, and perceive, the external world as it really is*. If you drop that assumption, the antinomies disappear.
* There *is* a 'noumenal' realm of 'things in themselves.' This is a necessary consequence of the fact that we have sensations at all. But we don't actually have *any* access whatsoever to these 'things in themselves.' We only have access to *phenomena* — that is, 'appearances.'
* In the world of appearances, both mind and matter are necessary ingredients. Knowledge must necessarily consist of both sensations and concepts — otherwise you wind up with transcendental nonsense or what William James would call, a century or so later, ""one big blooming, buzzing confusion."" But in the world of *noumena* — the things in themselves — even space and time don't have any place. Time and space are the necessary conditions for experience as such. To that extent, they're objectively real — as phenomena. 
* Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind.

&#x200B;"
681,AskPhilosophy,"Is there such a thing as ‘objectivity,’ when reality is only known by our personal experience?","Kant deals directly with this issue in the Critique of Pure Reason and might be a good place to turn to first.

He argues that we have a priori concepts that rule our cognition of empirical experience. These primary concepts are organized like this:

* **Quantity**

* Unity

* Plurality

* Totality

* **Quality**

* Reality

* Negation

* Limitation

* **Relation**

* Inherence and Subsistence (substance and accident)

* Causality and Dependence (cause and effect)

* Community (reciprocity)

* **Modality**

* Possibility

* Existence

* Necessity

Basically, these concepts are the most fundamental ones in cognition because they allow you to basically create other concepts that you would also form out of empirical data you get through sensibility. Now, his challenge is to prove that these concepts are objective in themselves. How can these concepts apply to objects external to subjectivity? This is where he offers multiple arguments: the objective deduction (that has two arguments, one for each edition of the book) and the subjective deduction. I'm just going to draft you the objective deduction of the second edition of the book.

Basically the argument (roughly) goes like this: 

1. All possible empirical experience of objects requires both intuition (empirical data) and thought (concepts). In other words it must come to the faculty of understanding which makes a synthesis of intuition and concepts.

2. Your empirical cognition requires apperception (self-consciousness). Basically, every empirical judgement you make requires to be addressed to a subject. Kant says the ""I think"" must accompany every cognitive representation. This implies a need for self-awareness.

3. That demand for appreception is only possible if there is what he calls a ""synthetic unity of transcendental appreception."" In other words, the self-awareness that is required in (2) must be able to synthesize all the representations that come with it. E.g: To say ""I feel hot"" my self-awareness must be able to do all the work required to combine my intuition of heat and my concept of hotness and so on. That's just a clarification of (2) really.

4. That synthetic unity of apperception must have the ability of making representations related to one another in a determinate **OBJECTIVE** way. E.g: My self-awareness must make my thoughts ordered in a certain way. I feel hot, **then** I feel cold. How is it that I feel hot, *then* cold and not the other way around? 

5. I feel hot *then* cold because my self-awareness's objectivity is made possible by the categories. The categories are required in order to have all the a priori knowledge possible to make the right ordering of my representations (thoughts). In order for me to have thought X before thought Y, and so on, my self-awareness must be guided by some determinate rules of judgement, which happen to be the categories.

Voila. Basically, Kant argues that the only way for us to reach a minimum of objectivity is because we have fundamental concepts that act as determine rules that permit our self-awareness to connect the dots properly when we think. 

What's amazing is that this argument respects the whole definition of subjectivity. We don't prove objectivity by ""reaching"" beyond our subjective whole, we simply happen to share tools that happen to make us do things in accordance with the objective world (e.g: we don't bump into furniture, we can orient ourselves in space and time in a non-chaotic way because what's required for this in geared *inside* of us).

I hope this helps. You can look the argument in sections 15-20. For further stuff you can look up [this](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-transcendental/) and [this](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20131751)."

*""By that I don't mean that everyone should know everything, but there are at least some things that we would consider ""common knowledge"", which I would guess would also increase.""*

it seems like you are also interested in the teaching side of how we deal with an increase of knowledge, which I can talk about.

___________________________________________________________________________________________

First a little epistemology. 
So it sounds like you are perceiving knowledge as object or substances that can be brought into ourselves to 'grow' our own knowledge by adding to it. This is a common perception of knowledge, but not the only one. Along with this way of thinking, one comes up with the idea of ""common knowledge"" which is supposed to be a conglomeration of what the most 'useful' or 'best' objects of knowledge that need to be taught in order to be a 'good' citizen. This way of thinking follows from the modern idea of the norm and that certain things must be known to be a functioning member of society. So if you're thinking in this way I can see why you would be concerned about the ever growing wealth of knowledge. ""If there is always more we need to know, how do me make sure everyone knows this 'common knowledge so that we can have a functioning society?""

However, I would like to point you in a different direction, at least in terms of pedagogy and learning. If we shift our way of thinking to a virtue epistemology, then instead of focusing on the objects/substances of knowledge, we instead focus on the virtue /character of the knower. Instead of asking ""do they know all the right 'common knowledge'"" we can ask ""are they a good knower"".
By teaching in this way, we focus instead on how people learn, so the question of 'are they learning enough of the right things fades to the background. It is not as important to make sure they know what is considered ""common knowledge"", instead we want to make them good knowers so that they can go on to learn what they want to learn.

___________________________________________________________________________________________

However, this seems to lead to your second concern

*""However, with increased breadth of available knowledge in society, I would assume (looking at history), that people would need to become more specialized in a specific field. While this can provide numerous benefits, it can also create vulnerabilities because everyone would become dependent on so many different specialized people. If one things goes wrong, a lot can go wrong. Is this a legitimate concern or are there possible solutions to fix this?""*

This way of thinking seems to stem from the modern way of thinking that we are all individuals who grow and survive based on our own wits and skills. I would say that this worry is unfounded and that the idea of the individual was a creation of modernity that doesn't truly exist. Yes, we have our own goals and thoughts and actions, but these things are always predicated on there being other people. We are always reliant on other people. 
I believe it was Eva Kittay, in her work on care ethics, that showed that we always need someone else to care for us. Either as a child, or when sick, or when old people always need the support of others. In her book ""Caring to Know"" Vrinda Dalmiya creates a form of care epistemology which brings this idea of relying on others to knowing from others. We always rely on others to know, and instead of seeing knowledge as something belonging to the individual, knowledge is caught up in the community and is formed and held by the community. So while, yes, things can go wrong when depending on people specializing in a certain domain of knowledge that not everyone can know, we are always relying on others for knowledge and to take care of us. So this worry is always abound, no matter how much knowledge is being found in the world.


Here is a good blog post that talks about knowledge being created by the community, instead of knowledge being something 'fed' to individuals.
[Community as Curriculum](http://davecormier.com/edblog/2008/06/03/rhizomatic-education-community-as-curriculum/#)

Edit: Here is a paper Kittay wrote that mentions how people are only ""temporarily abled"" and how we are much more reliant on each other than many people think. [Kittay](http://evafederkittay.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-ethics-of-care.pdf)
You can then expand this idea to the idea of knowledge seen in the work of Vrinda Dalmiya.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

p.s. There is also a whole argument to be made about who gets to decide what is ""common knowledge"". My critique would follow from the ideas of Michel Foucault and his concept of power-knowledge. The basic idea being that power and knowledge are always caught up in each other. The formation of ""common knowledge"" is just there because people in power determine what should be considered common. Therefore we should get away from the idea of ""common knowledge"" somewhat and instead focus on making students good knoweres instead. 
But I'm not too knowledgeable on postmodernists and Foucault to fully develop this critique. But maybe someone else here could."
686,AskPhilosophy,Can one say there is some sort of nobility in suicide ?,"> I've always believed that the man who takes his own life commits the most noble of all crimes, because he asserts his control over his own life, and that he shows that no man and no fate should have power over him. 

I'm not so sure we can say that of all or at least most instances of suicide. Much of the time, when we look at some of the causes of suicide, we see that many, if not most, come with a sense that the suicidal individual feels overwhelmed by something or other: financial debt, career setback, failure to meet family or social expectations, lost love, etc. Rather than an assertion of control over one's life, these sorts of suicides resemble more a ""giving-in"" of a sort to some other concern which does have power over them and their well-being. I think these are far, far more common than some authentic exercise of a fully-possessed will.

EDIT: That's not to say that this kind of suicide-as-pure-will is impossible or not worthy of consideration and discussion, but focusing solely on this sort of romantic, heroic view of suicide is a very real disservice to people who are struggling with much more immediate causes of psychological stress. 

>  I am curious to know if any philosopher has ever written on this subject.

There [are a few](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_suicide). Albert Camus is probably the most famous, who wrote that suicide is ""one truly serious philosophical problem."" ~~The view that you describe, I'd say, resembles something like Arthur Schopenhauer's.~~"
687,AskPhilosophy,Are we violating our negative duties towards the global poor by upholding an unjust global institutional order?,"By Pogge's cosmopolitan view, emphasis is placed on the *global affluent themselves*, as opposed to average citizens from affluent countries, in most heavily violating negative duties toward the global poor. This is partly because a global institutional order is shaped by the affluent and imposed on the poor which directly produces inequality. However, this is just a certain perspective as cosmopolitanism holds that the fundamental aspect of morality is the individual no matter their geographic location.

Edit: If you're interested, I recently posted in r/askeconomics about Pogge in hopes of [realizing ways to realistically and effectively help the global poor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/bhqdjt/how_would_it_be_realistically_possible_for_the/)"
688,AskPhilosophy,Is absence of evidence evidence of absence?,"Yea, this discussion comes up a lot in the philosophy of religion when talking about the existence of God if that's where you first heard about it from. A lot of New Atheists claim that an absence of evidence of God is evidence of God's absence, or that you can basically just assume something is false unless you can provide evidence for it. However, if you analyze it logically, that's definitely not true. If you and I were walking on the street and I pointed to someone else and said ""That guy does not have a pencil in his pocket"", that claim would still need some kind of evidence or support for you to believe it. It's not like only if I had claimed ""That guy *has* a pencil in his pocket"" does the statement need support. Either statement needs support, and if you have no evidence either way then it is rational to be agnostic on the question--you don't know if the person has a pencil in his pocket or not. The default position is not to assume that he has no pencil in his pocket.

So yes, your professor is absolutely right; however, there is another sort of argument or statement that is subtly distinct but actually accurate, whereas the statement ""absence of evidence is evidence of absence"" is false. It's really just the logical argumentation form, Modus Tollens:

1. If P, then Q.
2. Not Q.
3. Therefore, not P.

If you say:

1. If there is a chair in the room, then I would see it.
2. I do not see a chair in the room.
3. Therefore, there is no chair in the room.

This is a logical argument with probabilistically true premises. Assuming I'm not lying to myself (2) is true, and assuming I'm not hallucinating or some other strange phenomenon, (1) is true. But this argument is *sort of* like saying an absence of evidence (a lack of seeing a chair in this case) is evidence of absence, right? Here is the key difference though. If you expect there to be a certain kind of evidence given the existence of this thing or the truth of some statement, and that evidence is not there, then the lack of that evidence is indeed an argument against the existence of said thing.

For instance, in the philosophy of religion, the atheological Argument from Evil/Suffering works this way. It's saying that if there is a God we would expect a world with no suffering, but since we do not observe a world without suffering, there must not be a God. So it's sort of like saying an absence of a particular kind of evidence (a perfect world) is evidence of an absence (of God). You do have to be a bit careful with the word ""evidence"" though. Evidence is supposed to be something that supports a statement. An all-good world isn't necessarily *evidence* for God, it's just something we would expect if God exists. That gets into the Fallacy of Affirming the Consequent, but you can just google that if you're interested.

So I mean it's probably more accurate to say something like ""an absence of some thing or phenomenon X can be evidence of the absence of some thing or phenomenon Y if we would *expect* X given Y's truth/existence"". But anyway, this explanation was a bit all over the place, so hopefully it wasn't too confusing for you!

Edit: So again, just to add, not sure if you came to this idea from arguments about the existence of God and what not, but those New Atheists *sort of* have a point they're trying to make, but they're not thinking about it quite right. It's not that a lack of evidence for God is evidence for God's absence. It's more-so that they're assuming that certain phenomenon would be occurring if God exists, when in fact these phenomenon are not occurring. They're assuming there would be a lot more miracles, a lot more people able to communicate with God, less scientific explanations for things, etc. And then they're inferring that God must not exist because of this."
689,AskPhilosophy,Why do we slave away at work when we're only given one life to live on earth?,"Depends what you're asking.

If you're asking why people work *at all*, that's pretty easy. We do that because if we *don't* work, our lives will be a lot *shorter* than they would be otherwise. Simply put: don't work? Don't eat. That's often used as some kind of moral maxim, but I'm using it in a purely descriptive sense here. For vast majority of humanity over the vast majority of history, the only way to keep one's self from starving to death was to work. There may have been a fortunate few who were rich enough to avoid that, but not very many. 

More philosophically, there are a variety of theories as to why work is important. Both virtue ethicists and Marxists would say that engaging in productive work is an important part of what it means to be human, though they generally have different ways of articulating that. For many moral theorists, there's an important connection between labor and property rights, meaning one who does not work won't have much of a claim to eat (the moral version of the aphorism above). For others, there's some sense of moral obligation to support one's self to the best of one's ability, so as not to be a burden upon one's family or society as a whole. Etc. Many if not most moral philosophers have considered work to be morally significant, even if there is quite a diversity of perspectives as to how that works itself out. 

But you might be asking why so many of us seem to work jobs that we hate. That's a different question, and there are many different answers to that one too. Marx himself had a lot to say about [exploitation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/exploitation/) and alienation, viewing capitalists' profiting from the labor of workers as immoral, oppressive, and exploitative. So there's a moral failure here, but it'd be mostly on the part of capitalists and/or the bourgeoisie. But even many philosophers more-or-less friendly to capitalism recognize a moral failure in choosing to work a job one despises for inadequate reasons. Say there's a man with a job that requires very long hours, to the point that his relationships and other pursuits really suffer. If that is the only job he could possibly do that would permit him to support himself and his family, that might be excusable. But if he could very easily work a different job that lets him *be a better person* while still meeting whatever obligations he might be said to have? That starts to look like a moral failing of one sort or another. "
690,AskPhilosophy,Is fair to call Superman a hero when 99% of the time he he puts himself at no risk by saving people?,"He usually bears some cost--time and effort--and it seems natural that those who bear costs to help others are heroic even if they don't risk being harmed themselves (e.g., a person who spends her life assisting the poor and downtrodden). "
691,AskPhilosophy,"Emil Cioran wrote: ""The problem of responsibility would have a meaning only if we had been consulted before our birth and had consented to be precisely who we are."" Is that a fair statement?","Hannah Arendt has a very interesting treatment of natality that’s also concerned with the relationship between coming into being and responsibility. It doesn’t directly answer your question, but it’s a very different perspective on the same general subject.

Basically, Arendt thinks that humans are denaturable. Everyone is born a human, but not everyone is a human being—some people are human animals. You denature someone, destroy their humanness, by a) totally ejecting them from the social world, and b), eliminating their ability to respond to responsibility.

When Arendt talks about responsibility, she means the kind of responsibility (at least in part) that Cioran rejects: “I must be held responsible for something I have not done.” That is, the reason “for my responsibility must be my membership in a group (a collective) which no voluntary act of mine can dissolve, that is, a membership which is utterly unlike a business partnership which I can dissolve at will.” Hans Jonas describes this sense of responsibility, being charged with the care of others, as “parental”—parents are responsible for ensuring that no harm comes to their children, not merely for not harming them.

Therefore, quoting Stephen Schulman on Arendt’s account of natality:

“Putting the two senses of responsibility together, we can say that by being born, we are (or should be) part of a community in the sense that we should be burdened with the care of others, and they likewise should be burdened with our care. The more we run from this responsibility, the more of a burden it seems. The problem, however, is that we feel our responsibility for others—particularly for those we have not harmed—is not just a burden but *the* burden. In fact, Arendt’s claim, that the entire history of philosophy can be read as avoidance of the public, points to the tradition’s attempt to run away specifically from the fact that *we are,* in the plural sense, and are therefore responsible for each other and can and should act to care for others.”

Obviously, this doesn’t respond directly to Cioran—if it were meant to, it’d be circular. But the key is that Arendt thinks we have positive responsibilities (to care for others) that come about through no action of our own, simply by virtue of our necessary social relatedness, our plurality. I think that’s a very relevant perspective here.

You can get all this from reading the origins of totalitarianism and the human condition, but I’m pulling more specifically from a short piece by Stephen Schulman called “Arendt: Yes, She Is An Ethicist.”"
692,AskPhilosophy,Can biology be reduced to physics and chemistry?,"Back when logical positivism was the cool thing to do, reductionism was seen as a reasonable thing to pursue. Not so much nowadays. Part of that might be because logical positivism as a project failed, the interests of philosophers shifting to other things. But I think part of it is also that it's a project that does not solve a problem worth solving.

I have always found the concept of reductionism in science really weird. There is no inherent qualitative difference between biology, chemistry, and physics – they are just different ways to go about describing physical systems, and they are different because the intents differ. If I want to describe the trophic interactions in an ecosystem, I don't need to meddle in quantum mechanics. And someone interested in orbital mechanics does not need to make a distinction between proximate and ultimate explanations for behaviour.

In principle, a biological system can be described as a physical one. The behaviours of organic molecules are not random, it's jut that there are *a lot* of variables. But when a system is sufficiently complex, describing it in a less detailed way in order to get an overview of the big picture makes sense. Something like evolution could probably be described in entirely physical terms, but it would make for a terribly complex description that would be far more difficult to grasp. I could describe a poem in physical terms, perhaps as a mathematical description of the soundwaves supplanted by a complete physical description of all the phenomena referred to by the words. But it would make for an awfully bad way to enjoy poetry. I guess one could argue that reductionism is possible in principle, but that our limited human faculties makes it unattainable.

It's not that biology and physics are incommensurable paradigms in the Kuhnian sense, it's simply that they are very different toolkits used to solve different problems. Sure, there are some differences in how physics describes the world compared to how biology does it. But that is more for the practical reasons detailed above. Go back long enough, and it's all just *scientia* – the division of natural sciences into different disciplines is a fairly recent invention. Go back even further, and it's all just philosophy. At the end of the day, the various kinds of science are a social construct rather than a bunch of natural categories.

And speaking of Kuhn, I find it weird that these kinds of discussions always tend to overlook all the *tacit* knowledge that goes into a research paradigm. A physicist  typically does not know squat about dissecting invertebrates or using a plankton sieve. And I as a biologist sure don't know much about the proper use of all the gizmos a physicist uses. These things are also part of what makes biology and physics their own things.

693,AskPhilosophy,"What is the key differences between Atheistic Existentialism, Monotheistic Existentialism, Absurdism, and Nihilism? Also, what unites all of them?","I will only partially answer your question based on what I know. Someone else might be able to chip in for the rest. I highly recommend you to read ""Existentialism is a Humanism"" by Jean-Paul Sartre. In this work, Sartre explicitly states that he's an atheistic existentialist, meaning that he does not believe in the possibility of a higher power. The common belief between a theistic existentialist and an atheist existentialist is that both believe that existence precedes essence. In defining an existentialist, Sartre states:

>It has become fashionable to call this painter, or musician or columnist an ""existentialist"" - a term so loosely applied that it no longer means anything at all. However, it can be defined easily. Existentialists are either Christian, such as the Catholics Jaspers and Gabriel Marcel, or atheists like Heidegger and myself. What they have in common is to believe that existence comes before essence, that we always begin from the subjective. What does this mean? If one considers a manufactured object, say a book or a paper-knife, one sees that it has been made to serve a definite purpose. It has an essence, the sum of its purpose and qualities, which precedes its existence. The concept of man in the mind of God is comparable to the concept of paper-knife in the mind of the artisan.

Hope this bit of information helps.

694,AskPhilosophy,"There was existentialism, structuralism, post-structuralism/postmodernism, but have there been any similarly big ""movements"" in philosophy to come after?","Yes, there are movements right now that claim to be beyond poststructuralism/postmodernism.

Two major thinkers right now that claim to be beyond poststructuralism are Alain Badiou and Slavoj Žižek.

**Žižek and Hegel** 

Žižek turns to Lacan to provide a theory of the subject that can handle the criticisms of Althusser and Foucault. Using Lacan, he revamps Hegelian idealism and dialectical materialism. His project also involves an explicit rejection of postmodernism and liberal discourse. He also adds to his Hegelianism a materialism developed out of Schelling's philosophy of nature and quantum mechanics.

He also is the funniest philosopher we have had in a long time. He could literally make a living as a stand up comic, and his books and lectures are wildly entertaining, yet also rich with philosophical content. 

Žižek isn't the only one turning to Hegel, as even analytic philosophers today are making a ""return to Hegel"" (cf. Pittsburgh Hegelians like Brandom, McDowell). Likewise, a number of continental thinkers are turning to German Idealism generally (especially Hegel and Schelling), but reading it in a much more metaphysical/realist/materialist way (Žižek, Markus Gabriel, Iain Hamilton Grant, Adrian Johnston, Catherine Malabou). 

**Badiou and the Event** 

Badiou defends a notion of absolute truth, espousing a realist ontology based in mathematics. His project is also explicitly a rejection of postmodernism, yet Badiou develops this out of the French tradition of philosophy of mathematics (e.g. Jean Cavaillès), combining in elements of analytic philosophy, set theory, and the work of 20th century mathematicians. While still definitely part of the movement of thinking philosophy from the standpoint of difference (like Derrida, Deleuze, etc.), Badiou's concept of absolute, universal truth (manifested in the event of truth) is definitely an interesting break from ""postmodernism."" He also, like Žižek, turns to Lacan for a theory of the subject, offering a similar alternative to the postmodern critique of the subject.

He also has a really great book on ethics (called *Ethics*), which provides a refreshingly universal theory of ethical truth, defined in terms of the good. *Being and Event*, however, is his masterpiece. When writing it, Badiou claimed to have written a great book of philosophy. He might be right. 

**OOO and New Materialism**

Alongside these two thinkers, there has been a major turn toward realism and forms of materialism. The two major movements that have begun are called ""object oriented ontology"" (Graham Harman, Levi Bryant), which involves basically weird readings of Heidegger and Whitehead, and the ""new materialism"" (Manuel DeLanda, Jane Bennett, Quentin Meillassoux), which is more based out of Deleuze, Spinoza, Hobbes, Lucretius, and the like. The term ""new realism"" is also used to describe the position of realists thinkers drawing off German idealism (e.g. Markus Gabriel).


[The European Graduate School Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/user/egsvideo) are a great way to catch up on these new movements, and most of these thinkers have lectures on YouTube."
695,AskPhilosophy,Which philosophers were actually happy at the end of their life or put forth a philosophy that may make people happy to follow?,"From Betrand Russell's *The Conquest of Happiness*: ""I was not born happy...Now, on the contrary, I enjoy life; I might almost say that with every year that passes I enjoy it more...very largely it is due to a diminishing preoccupation with myself."""
696,AskPhilosophy,What are the most notable cases of renowned philosophers engaging in bad philosophy?,"Colin McGinn's recent(-ish) books on disgust and the philosophy of physics were pretty fucking egregious.

697,Ask_Politics,How come more Americans know about Antifa but don't seem to know who the Proud Boys or other far-right groups are?,"I think it's because of the talking point bias. Have you ever truly heard Trump mention any of them outside Antifa? Think about it. His speeches are based around who he doesn't like and blaming them for problems he is creating or ignoring.

That's my best guess."
698,Ask_Politics,"In European countries things like universal health care, high taxes, strict gun laws, etc. are considered as policies of ""the middle"", why do Americans consider these things as ""Leftist policies""?","America is a conservative (small 'c') country. Whether by virtue of its puritanical origins or something else, academics have debated the point for a long time and there is no real consensus. I believe there is something to be said about the nature of individualism in the US leading to a lack of trust in the institutions of the federal government. Plenty of people consider taxation as theft, and have an obsession over where  'their tax dollars' are put to use. 

The Constitution and the Bill of Rights instilled Americans with a belief in the absolute and inalienable rights of the individual, particularly in the case of the Second Amendment and the 'right to bear arms'. Similarly, the myth of the American Dream puts the onus on the individual to achieve their own success by virtue of hard work in a society of few barriers. Fredrick Jackson Turner proposed the Frontier Thesis in 1893, suggesting that the nature of the American frontier released settlers from the old European mindsets. 

The Second World War plays a big part in modern European attitudes towards collective responsibility. Plenty of our social and welfare programs were instituted in the aftermath of the war, when the focus was on rebuilding as a society. The NHS in the UK was a product of this for example. The impact of utter devastation experienced across Europe can't be underestimated.

699,Ask_Politics,Does (D) Bernie Sanders have a chance of making the ballot?,"As of right now, his chances of winning the Democratic nomination appear to be slim to nil.

[60 to 70% of Democrats](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html) prefer Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Bernie Sanders is running between about 50 and 65 points behind her, and is consistently outperformed by both Elizabeth Warren (who has repeatedly and emphatically stated that she is not running) and Joe Biden. [In a CBS/NYT poll released May 5](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-the-2016-presidential-race/), only 23% of Democrats said they would consider voting for Sanders, while only 7% said they would *not* consider voting for Hillary. (Keep in mind that these polls were taken *after* the email and Clinton Foundation scandals broke, in light of which she has proved [remarkably durable](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_presidential_race.html).)

I frequently see Sanders compared electorally to Obama on Reddit. But [at this point in 2007](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/democratic_presidential_nomination-191.html), Clinton was only at 36% and Obama was at 23%. In the preceding four months, Obama had increased his share by close to 10 percentage points; Sanders, by contrast, has barely budged. Furthermore, at no point during the 2008 primary season was Obama ever more than about 25 percentage points behind Clinton. Sanders' standing now is not comparable to Obama's standing then, nor is Clinton's sheer numerical superiority now comparable to her nebulous ""air of inevitability"" then. [FiveThirtyEight's analysis](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-hillary-clinton-steamroller-rumbles-to-life/) is that she's the most dominant primary frontrunner we've ever seen.

I've been a fan of Sanders since back when he was in the House,  but I do not see a path to the Democratic nomination for him in 2016. The numbers just don't add up. As Harry Enten writes, ""stranger things have … well, OK, maybe not.""

**Edit: Well, this is unexpected**. A few thoughts:

1. I posted this a month ago (why is it blowing up now?), so obviously the exact numbers are no longer current. [The big picture](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html), however, remains the same.

2. I'm aware of the recent New Hampshire poll, and I haven't changed my prognosis (again: ""as of right now...""). One poll from one state means little--it's a single data point in a sea of data; and if it *is* ""real"" rather than an outlier, it's too early to tell what it means (i.e. whether it's a temporary bump, a shift in the landscape, or a little of both). This is why my post references RCP averages, which are averages over several large national polls, tracked on a moving basis. If, over successive polling cycles, a sustained nationwide trend emerges, that's a different story."

701,Ask_Politics,Tomorrow the supreme court will hear arguments regarding documents that trump is refusing to hand over. Technically he's telling his banks to keep them. What happens if they rule against trump and trump still doesn't allow them to hand them over? How the supreme court enforce it? The DOJ?,"Good question, but I think you have a muddy understanding of the actors involved in this situation. 

In these lawsuits, it's not the House of Representatives suing Trump or his banks to get access to records. All of Trump's banks involved in these tax returns suits have stated that they will turn over Trump's tax returns in response to legal House subpoenas. In order to stop this, Trump has sued his banks to block them from complying. So in effect, on one side Trump is fighting to keep his documents secret. On the other side, his banks are fighting for the right to release them. That's why the Mazars lawsuit, for example, isn't called US vs Mazars or US vs Trump... it's called Trump vs Mazars.  

If the Supreme Court rules against Trump, then the subpoenaed banks win the right to turn over the documents to the House, and the banks have stated that they will do so. Trump and the DOJ can't do jack squat. 

Trump can't ""not allow"" his banks to turn over his tax returns, because the court will have ruled that the banks can comply with the subpoenas regardless of Trump's wishes. And the DOJ doesn't have to ""enforce"" the ruling because releasing the returns is exactly what the banks are arguing they should be allowed to do.

You can find plenty of articles online summarizing the legal arguments on either side as to whether the President is above the law or subject to it, but I hope this helps clear up how things will likely wind up proceeding if Mazars and other banks win the right to comply."
702,Ask_Politics,Russia is not much of a power and has roughly the GDP of Italy. Why does the Russian government behave the way they do?,"I think you answered your own question. Russia is an economic lightweight whose efforts at regional integration (the Eurasian Economic Union) look more like a racketeering scheme that pales in comparison to the European Union's common market or China's efforts. Yet Russia's leadership is [paramountly concerned with being treated as an equal](https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/yes-it-is-a-new-cold-war-what-is-to-be-done/) and covets the status of being a 'great power.' Invading its neighbors and military interventionism abroad (Syria, Libya, Central African Republic) is Russia's way of asserting its status in light of immense domestic malaise. On top of that there's a certain sense of satisfaction Russia's government derives from acting this way, and there's probably an assumption that so long as Russia projects power abroad its citizens at home will care less and less about domestic issues."
703,Ask_Politics,Why can’t we just let the airlines fail if that’s their destiny?,"We can, but then tens of thousands of people lose their jobs, people are unable to travel for months even after the end of the crisis, and eventually new airlines spring up. Or, maybe, most airlines fail while one or two raise a lot of money to survive and establish a monopoly.

An airline is a very complex company, so ""airline startups"" are very messy to set up.

It's possible to do it your way but arguably more disruptive then saving these businesses. 

Companies should be prepared for hard times but this is a massive shock that's completely out of their control and will last many months. If there's ever a good reason to intervene in the economy, this is it."

708,Ask_Politics,Why are anti-racism and anti-police brutality partisan issues?,"As a non American looking in from the outside, I get the impression that it's mostly to do with the different media that each side consumes. 

Taking the recent unrest as an example, someone who only really watches things like Fox News and is part of right-wing social media circles has had a wildly different experience than someone who watches some of the less fervently right-wing news networks, or has been getting news directly from reporters and other people on the ground through social media

These two worlds of information mean that for some people the issue is riots, looting and attacks on police, because that's what they have been shown. That's all they've been shown. 

While the protests are pretty substantial, the vast majority of Americans aren't actually there, so they can only experience these things through the lense of whatever media outlets they trust. I think in most cases the difference is not actually in fundamental values, it's in what a given group's experience (through the media they consume) of an event has been."
709,Ask_Politics,"Those old enough to remember the LA riots, what was the situation like compared to now?","I was living in the midwest, in a mostly white suburb of a major city. 

One thing that I think is important to know, especially if you are younger, is that there are two important, inter-related factors that have changed the game: Social Media and Camera Phones.

Back in the 90s, personal video cameras were big clunky things that you mostly kept in your closet, and only got out for special occasions like birthdays or weddings. You had to charge their batteries-- which means that probably 99% of the time, the camera in your closet was not ready to work. Also, it took big clunky VHS cassette tapes, and if you didn't have any lying around that you wanted to tape over, you had to buy some, so you had to go out of your way a little bit. 

Long short, nobody had a video camera ready to record anything. If you did, you were probably a complete weirdo, honestly. If you saw a guy walking down the sidewalk with a video camera taping something, you probably would have thought he was a complete paranoid or eccentric. People only taped things like birthdays, weddings, etc.  Most people didn't tape anything, because you didn't have a camera. I think I have literally one video from my childhood. We don't have video of any of my relatives weddings, until the era of smartphones.

The second part of this is social media. Back then, and I know I sound like I'm 100 years old, but the only way to know or learn about current events was 1. See it on the evening news 2. Hear it on the radio 3. read it in the paper the next day. There wasn't any way for things to ""go viral"" the way that somebody's post on social media does. **Average people couldn't get information into the mainstream news, it was always filtered through producers, editors, and reporters.** Today, that script is flipped; often times somebody's post on social media will itself become a news story, because it went viral. Social Media sometimes drives news stories. 

So say you did have a VHS video cassette of the police beating somebody. How would you get anybody else to see it? You would have to have them into your living room, pop the tape in the VCR, hit play, and have them watch it. Then they say ""wow, that's crazy"" or ""what the hell am I even watching?"" You would have been a complete weirdo. Or, say you didn't want to try to bring people into your living room to see what might be snuff porn; you would have to duplicate the video tape somehow. Most people did not have this capability. You would need two VCRs to do this (while some people might have two VCRs in different rooms in their house, they probably didn't have the wires to duplicate a tape), and you would have to run the original at real-time speed to make one copy. And then you have to try to convince somebody to actually watch this janky generic store-bought video tape that you're trying to hand them. 

Long short, there was no way for video that you shot to go viral. 

So, the amazing thing about the Rodney King beating was that 1. A guy who had a clear line of sight of the beating had a camera ready enough to go, and 2. The evening news actually decided to run the footage. Looking back now, the second part is the most surprising to me, because it goes against the normal media narrative that the police are always here to help you. (Watch the 2014 movie *Nightcrawler* with Jake Gyllenhaal about how media creatives narratives by selecting stories).

So what happened was that white people all across the nation saw what black people in the US had known for hundreds of years. 

Of course, what **didn't** happen was that white people said ""Oh my gosh! Black people were right all along, they weren't just complaining! How did we never see this?"" There was a lot of justification of the beating, the same crap you hear today, ""he got what he deserved"", ""he should have listened"", ""he was on drugs"", ""well we didn't see the whole video* etc. etc. 

The LA riots seemed to come out of nowhere. Because white people were so willing to justify the beating, or at least write it off, white Americans thought that black people were overreacting. And you hear the same racist crap that you hear now ""They're savages"", ""I don't agree with what the police did, but this is the wrong response"" blah blah blah. 

So I think overall, it drove divisions between white and black Americans even further. Black Americans had been dealing with police persecution for decades; now there was finally incontrovertible evidence that had gotten through to white people, and they were just like ""well whatever"". As far as white people knew, this was maybe the first time this had ever happened, and those officers were just a few rogue apples. I think white apathy fueled some of the riots, which led white people to think it was an overreaction, and then retroactively justify the beating.

All in all, it was something that happened ""in LA"", as far as white people were concerned; it didn't implicate polices forces or black Americans across the nation."

Even then, some say all citizens are a part of the militia, and others says only those trained by the government are part of the militia. Even further, some say *any* restriction is in violation of the 2A, the overwhelming majority disagrees.

I'll just briefly iterate what established law says. Looking at the colonialist and founders,"" Americans understood the 'right of self-preservation' as permitting a citizen to 'repe\[l\] force by force' when ''the intervention of society in his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury.'"" One purpose of firearms is that they are ""necessary to the security of the free state"" because they allow ""able-bodied men""  to ""better . . . resist tyranny."" *Heller* goes into way more detail, but essentially, yes to your answer. There's multiple reasons, Scalia asserts, for the 2A and the meaning the founder's intended. But resisting tyranny (specifically in reference to the King of England) was one of those.

>…there are several big hurdles facing any Democrat looking to use the language of faith to marshal voters in the primary. For one thing, the Democratic coalition isn’t dominated by a single religious group. And Democrats don’t prioritize religion the way Republicans do — in fact, the Democratic Party has been growing steadily *less* religious over the past 20 years. Certain groups of religious voters — in particular, black Protestants — will likely play an important role in the [2020 presidential] primary, and there may be some room for candidates to appeal to religious moderates.

715,Ask_Politics,Why is america so polarized?,"I don't think it's fair to blame the two party system entirely. I think that's a factor, but we've had a two party system for over 200 years and have had many periods which were noticeably NOT polarized anywhere closet to the degree we see now. If the two party system were solely to blame then we would have been this polarized for our entire history. Note that there *have* been times of extreme polarization in the past, most notably in the 1850s-60s and the 1960s-70s. However, there have also been times when polarization was almost non-existent (the Era of Good Feelings, the 1940s-50s, etc).

I think there are two leading factors in the modern hyper-polarization: the underlying cause and the proximate cause.

The underlying cause is the fact that the US, ever since its founding, has really been two distinct cultures forced to live together under one roof. At the founding this was the proto-industrial, liberal North (using liberal as in classical liberalism, not as in the modern Democratic Party) and the agrarian, aristocratic South. The Northern colonies were largely founded as experiments in enlightenment era political science. These were the people we learned about in grade school looking for religious and political freedoms. They experimented with new forms of government and new societal structures. Conversely, the Southern colonies were largely founded as individual fiefdoms with the specific intent of growing crops to produce a profit. They had more hierarchical social and political structures than England, where the owners of the colonies came from. As the populations of the colonies grew the cultures were heavily influenced by the purpose for the colonies' existences. When the Revolution came about the Founding Fathers absolutely recognized this inherent difference. It's one of the large reasons the Articles of Confederation (the government they formed immediately after the war) was so weak and ultimately failed. The North and South were so culturally and economically different that the two didn't trust each other. They didn't want to empower a central government that might be taken over by the other ""side"".

During the Constitutional Convention there were all kinds of compromises between the two sides which reflect the inherent distrust they had for each other. Every state getting the same votes in the Senate placated the smaller population Southern states while the proportional representation in the House placated the larger population Northern states. The 3/5 compromise (which said that slaves would be counted as 3/5 of a person for purposes of apportionment of Representatives in the House) was a compromise between the North, who did not want slaves counted at all as that would give the South more representation, and the South, who wanted slaves counted as a full person as that would increase their population count and number of Representatives. The South was also terrified that the North would use the strong federal government created by the Constitution to abolish slavery, so they got accommodations to assure them this wouldn't happen. For example, the Constitution prohibits the federal government from banning slavery (without actually using the word ""slave"") until 1808.

Eventually this cultural dichotomy within American society would manifest in the two party system. In Washington's administration the kernels of the first two party system were formed when Thomas Jefferson, a Southern Virginian, and Alexander Hamilton, a Northern New Yorker, clashed on virtually every issue. They formed political coalitions around themselves which eventually developed into Hamilton's Federalist Party and Jefferson's Anti-Federalist or Democratic-Republican Party (the party which would eventually evolve into the modern Democratic Party).

Over time the divisions evolved, waxing and waning. The 1830s was a noticeably non-partisan time known as the Era of Good Feelings. By the 1850s, however, the division had returned so strong that it erupted into the Civil War in the 1860s. The divisions lessened again in the late 19th century, but again returned in the early 20th century during the Progressive Era and the first Red Scare. The Great Depression, New Deal, and WWII combined to largely unite American culture, but the 1960s saw a resurgence in polarization to a degree not seen since the 1850s. Polarization again died down in the late 70s and early 80s, but the modern era of hyper-polarization began to ramp up in the late 80s.

In a very real sense you can track the modern hyper-polarization to two key causes: the rise of conservative talk radio and eventually television and Newt Gingrich. Radio had been a staple of political culture since at least the 1930s. It was seen as a tool politicians could use to speak directly to the people without the editorial filter of a newspaper. FDR used it to great effect with his Fireside Chats and, over in Germany, Hitler was famous for using it to spread the Nazi ideology. By the 1950s talk radio shows hosted by people who's sole job was to be a radio host was becoming a staple of conservative political culture in the US. However, in 1949 the Federal Communications Commission introduced a rule called the Fairness Doctrine which required holders of broadcast licenses (both television and radio) to present controversial issues of public interest in a way which the FCC deemed ""honest, equitable, and balanced."" In effect, this meant that if a radio station aired a conservative political talk show then they also had to provide equal time to a liberal talk show. Likewise, if a television show reported the news, it had to do so in a manner which gave equal weight to both the conservative and liberal viewpoints. So an individual listening to the radio or watching TV would hear both sides of a story reported in equal weight. However, in 1987 the Reagan appointed FCC chair eliminated the Fairness Doctrine. Within a year conservative talk radio networks, which only aired conservative viewpoints, sprang up across the country. Less than a decade later former Nixon media guru Roger Ailes, with financial backing from Australian conservative media magnate Rupert Murdoch, launched Fox News as a specifically and intentionally conservative news outlet to do the same things the conservative radio shows were doing, but on television with a larger audience and wider reach. Over time this had the effect of creating a media bubble for people who strictly consumed conservative media, allowing those conservative voices to shape their world view.

The other major factor in modern polarization was Newt Gingrich. Gingrich was a Republican political operative who won a seat in Congress in 1978. Both Houses of Congress had been controlled by the Democrats for nearly half a century, with only a few exceptions (47-49 & 53-55). By the time Gingrich took his seat the Republican Party had resigned itself (at least legislatively) to being a permanent minority opposition party. Republicans in Congress talked about how they could moderate Democratic policies, but had almost entirely given up on pushing their own policies or ideology. Gingrich rejected this line of thinking. He came up a political strategy to retake control of Congress by stoking division and polarization. Since the Democrats had been controlling Congress for as long as anyone could remember, Congress had become synonymous with Democratic politics. So, Gingrich reasoned, if he could just make voters dislike Congress as an institution, that would translate into a distrust of and disgust with the Democratic Party. He could then present the Republican Party as the opposition, not to the Democrats, but to Congress as a whole. So he went about stymieing anything and everything he could. He worked to stop Congress from passing as many bills as he could to make them look ineffective. About this time was also when CPSAN began broadcasting Congressional debates on television. Gingrich would make speeches on the House floor which were solely intended for news broadcasters to be able to cut up and use sensational soundbites in their programs. He'd give long, rants yelling about this controversy or that appalling action by Democrats, often to a mostly empty House chamber. News stations would air portions of his speeches and, since they happened on the floor of Congress, they carried and extra weight of authority.

Gingrich's strategy worked. Public approval of Congress took a nosedive and, in 1994, Gingrich led the Republican Party to take the House and keep it for the first time since they lost control in 1930.

I know this may sound partisan, blaming much of the modern polarization on conservative media and Republican politicians, but that's the way it went. Gingrich has spoken numerous times about the political strategy I described above. He doesn't keep it a secret. Likewise, Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes have similarly spoken publicly about how they created Fox News with the intention of creating  conservative media environment to sway the views of voters to get more Republicans elected. They've talked about how they intentionally stoked culture wars in order to build resentment against the Democratic Party in order to convince voters that even if they disliked their Republican politicians they still had to vote for the Republicans to block the Democrats. They built upon the already existent division which goes back to the founding of the country to create an environment in which Republicans can win elections despite representing a minority of Americans."
716,Ask_Politics,Whats with Internets obsession with Andrew Yang?,"Canadian YangGang here. Disregarding all his policies (because we don't want a debate here), I'll be going over a few characteristics and achievements about Andrew Yang that appeals to me, and the majority of his supporters:

* He's not a career politician, he's an entrepreneur, humanitarian and problem-solver. He knows how to speak on the ground level and relates to a lot of people. Doesn't use ""political-speak"".
* He's not stuck to any ideologies but instead is very malleable and follows the data, or the ""MATH"" so to speak. If data points one way, you'll be sure to find Andrew Yang there. (Therefore his policies are also fluid).
* He speaks in numbers, which speaks to a lot of students, engineers, programmers, etc. (who are the majority of his supporters, myself included).
* He's a futurist (although he jokes he's a ""present-ist"" cuz everyone else is behind). He is very knowledgeable in the technology of the future and he is very aware of current internet trends (unlike the majority of his competition).
* He's the guy the Republicans thought Trump would be, but isn't. And a lot of his supporters consider him as the new Bernie 2.0 of the 21st century. In fact, the majority of his supporters were once BernieBros. Essentially he has a lot of bi-partisan appeal. His slogan is ""It's not left, it's not right, it's forward!"".
* He's a literal genius. The smartest candidate on that debate stage and I'm not even exaggerating this. At the age of ***12*** he completed in the 0.5 percentile in SAT scores. He has also completed the LSAT with a score of 178/180 which is insane. But probably one of his best educational accomplishments was that he completed the GMAT with a score of 780.  To put this into perspective, the average score of someone that gets accepted to Harvard is 730. Yang is 50 points ABOVE that, which is a near impossible feat.
* He founded Venture for America which is a non-profit organization that helps facilitate new entrepreneurs into the current job market and start new businesses. He created thousands of jobs throughout the country. He was honored by the Obama administration for this work, and received medals.
* Despite being 44 years old, he's a really laid back, funny and charismatic guy. If you watch any of his long-form interviews, whether [Joe Rogan](https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8), [H3H3](https://youtu.be/otEbT0l_Hbg), or [Ben Shapiro](https://youtu.be/-DHuRTvzMFw), you'll catch him throwing jokes and laughing quite often. [Try this 9 minute speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evP21V0OoPQ&feature=youtu.be&list=WL) and look at the faces of the DNC board behind him (skip to the last minute if you like).
* He's the resident bad boy of the Democratic party. [Just check out his childhood and school photos](https://imgur.com/a/5FLCsDK), complete with anti-establishment gusto 😂
* He can play [basketball](https://twitter.com/andrewyang/status/1183764021654310912?lang=en), [piano](https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1171244434735976448?s=19), [skateboard](https://twitter.com/Zach_Graumann/status/1179611906912313344), he's into video games and memes. Not sure if you caught it in last night's debate or the debate prior, but he even uses memes as ammo for the debates. For example, last night was [Chapelle's modern solutions meme](https://imgur.com/xOATx04) which he used against Warren. The debate prior, he used the [Joker meme](https://imgur.com/a/JUUjBV3) to defend his $120,000 give away to 10 families in an interview. I think the Yang subreddit has a lot to do with this.
* Yang's campaign advisers are young, and most likely check out Yang's subreddit quite often. I get the sense that they're people just like you and me, not corporate cogs in some machine. This is [Zach](https://twitter.com/carlypreilly/status/1184443985592573954?s=20), his campaign manager. Their bromance is very real :')
* Anyone who's read his book, the [War on Normal People](https://www.amazon.com/War-Normal-People-Disappearing-Universal/dp/0316414212/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=the+war+on+normal+people&qid=1571272757&sr=8-2), will know that Yang was bullied in school and was often ridiculed. These were transformative years for him, and helped developed his personality. In parties, he would often find the wallflower in the room and start a conversation with them to make them feel appreciated. He's extremely wholesome, sympathetic, caring and forgiving. 

Anyways, my 2 cents.

717,Ask_Politics,"Trump & Bolsonaro oppose lockdowns, masks. What are they criticizing China for not having done to stop covid19 going global?","What Trump is criticising is the fact that China turned away WHO inspectors and didn’t inform the rest of the world about the virus. 

He is also criticising them not acting fast enough (with lockdowns and masks). He’s being hypocritical on this second point. 

China turning away WHO investigators early on was met with worldwide criticism, but by railing on them hypocritically and attacking the WHO as a whole, Trump has muddied the water and diverted the condemnation of China to condemnation of him (fairly enough imo). 

China should have let WHO inspectors in, but by withdrawing WHO funding, Trump has made things worse for him, and the US, by reducing our standing  on the world stage. 

I don’t know too much about Bolsonaro, but I’m assuming it’s something similar, from what I’ve heard."
718,Ask_Politics,"Is Clarence Thomas the only current Justice on the Supreme Court who openly advocates for the repeal of ""Roe v Wade?"" Might there be others lurking?","There was a time when prospective Supreme Court appointees and other judges would decline to comment on cases that may come before them. Doesn't seem to be the practice for some, today."
719,Ask_Politics,Why aren’t more conservatives environmentalists?,"In general, conservatives are more about free market and reducing regulations. Conservatives advocate for ""market based solutions"" where the free market will eventually figure out how to solve our problems.

Progressives try to use government to regulate what they think needs to change.

In order to combat climate change, the government would either have to subsidize clean energy (which would go AGAINST the free market), tax carbon and other greenhouse gases (which goes against a free market and increase regulation), or take control of the energy industry and utilities (obviously increasing regulation and destroying the free market).

Conservatives generally don't want the government running things as they think the government is rife with waste and inefficiencies. So all the above ""progressive"" solutions (plus anymore you can probably think up) involve more regulation, less free market, and increased government spending."
720,Ask_Politics,"In theory, can a US President resign soon after being sworn into office to purposely let the VP become the new President?","Yep, in theory. The 25th Amendment dictates the transition of power for the president and it doesn't stipulate a required 'time in power.'

Section 1: In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.

Also, if something happens to the VP, the president can nominate a new one who is confirmed by 2/3 majority of House/Senate.

 If the president is unable to preform the duties of the office for a short time (surgery, etc.) the VP takes over until such time the VP and Congress believes the president can preside again. 

The truly scary part is that if something happens to the VP after an election, the new VP is then chosen by the majority vote in Congress. Assuming that passes, if the president was then to abdicate from illness or resignation, then the Vice President is raised into the presidency through ZERO democratic processes; no votes were made in favor of that president. Scary stuff."
721,Ask_Politics,Is the USA a fundamentally different kind of country?,"Well, we were the United States for about 16 years before the Constitution was even written. And that was when most of the colonies still thought of themselves as separate entities and were only banding together out of shared interest.

I think there is a lot more that defines our country as a single entity than just the Constitution. We have a pretty strong culture which binds us together. If for whatever reason the government were to fall and the Constitution were to be scrapped, I think people in all parts of the country would still identify as American, and still want to be a part of the same country.

In short, the Constitution isn't the only thing telling people from California, Texas, South Dakota, Alaska, Kentucky, Maine, and Wyoming that they all share a common identity. In fact, I'd argue the Constitution is a relatively minor part of that shared identity."
722,Ask_Politics,So the only way a SCOTUS nominee will ever be appointed again is only if a party controls BOTH the presidency and the senate?,"I mean you don't need to look to the future, just look at the country from 2014 to the present day. One side doesn't need to compromise on appointments, and will just wait out any opposing president until they have their own in power."
723,Ask_Politics,"From my observation as a US citizen, the US is currently experiencing a serious culture war. How will it end? How will it unfold? What will happen?","There are two broad out comes.

1) the division gets bigger and bigger until it explodes. Last time the U.S. exploded culturally was probably Bleeding Kansas, which happened right before the U.S. Civil War. In this case the violence gets worse and worse until the U.S. is in a new Civil War.

2) things calm down. COVID is dealt with so makes aren't an issue, we start to take reformation action against the Police, and try to do damage control about climate change."
724,Ask_Politics,"The common defense of the electoral college is that without it, ""only the cities would choose the president"". Inversely, as someone who lives in a red-state-but-blue-city, I feel like my vote doesn't matter. What is the necessity for the electoral college in today's day in age?","In my understanding....

The House of Representatives is to represent the people of the United States.

The Senate is to represent the States, not the people. This is reflected in the original method for choosing senators - they were appointed by the Governors or State Legislatures (who are meant to represent the people of their state) 

The President is an overarching branch which is to balance these two, sometimes, competing philosophies.

This - to my understanding - is why the electoral college exists as it is. Each state gets minimum 3 electors (2 Senators, 1 Rep Minimum) - to balance representation of the state vs representation of the people.

Regarding how electors are assigned, this is left to the states themselves - not all states are winner-takes-all, some assign electors by popular vote.

Again, the policy of winner-takes-all was to balance representation of the people vs the states and to boost the significance of smaller, less populous states, hoping to counter the ""Tyranny of the Majority"" - and probably because it was simpler.

Some people claim that the assignment of electors was to allow for new information to come out after the election and to allow ""faithless electors"" to vote against the result of their state when the circumstances dictate - this has never swayed an election as far as we are aware. 

""Only cities would choose the president"" is a flawed argument, especially as less than 20% of the country lives in the top 100 most populous cities. This spawns the argument of how do you define cities - if you go by city limits the 20% is correct, but by metropolitan area you have a much larger population - NYC ""Proper"" has a population of 8,336,817 by 2019 estimates with an area of 1212km^2 including water area, but the ""New York *Metropolitan Area*"" has a population of 22,679,948 by 2018 estimates and spread over an area of 34,490km^2 which covers 4 states.

Then you have to think about how small do you consider a city - is #100 Baton Rouge - Population ~220,000 small enough or do we need to go smaller still, all the way to the city of Anderson, SC - Population 27,676 by 2019 estimates which according to some list on github isn't even in the top 1000 cities. 

And, being chosen by the cities assumes that all the city dwellers vote the same way - I've lived in enough places to know that the US isn't ***THAT*** different from the rest of the world and cities have their share of diverse opinions.

People living in cities are statistically more likely to be younger which swings them liberal - but you have university students mixing with working class kids who work in mcdonalds or are lucky enough to score an apprenticeship with a plumbing firm.

Saying that the cities choose the President assumes that a popular vote would be winner takes all in the cities vs winner takes all in the states."
725,Ask_Politics,How would the US react to a law requiring companies to provide full time employees with at least 2 weeks of vacation?,The company would cut everyone's hours so they were classified as part time.
726,Ask_Politics,Why didn't they release the tapes earlier?,The recording was released as part of the book promotion. And the book release is timed to coincide with the election. So that pretty much required waiting until now.
727,Ask_Politics,"If DC and Puerto Rico achieve statehood, would Republicans seek to add more states to counterbalance the Senate?","It would put Democrats at a huge advantage as compared to their present state, where democrats have struggled in the senate. 4 senators, likely to be all democrats would help them immensely, and the added advantage to the house of reps too. I dont know what new states the republicans can make next that would always give them an advantage, most of the ""could be"" states scenario are almost all democrat leaning states."
728,Ask_Politics,"Which state did Hillary win in 2016 that Biden is most likely to lose in 2020? Conversely, which state did Hillary lose in 2016 that Biden is most likely to win in 2020?","Take a look at [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com) for a much better answer with more depth than you'll receive here. They have an excellent polling average and break down the individual states as well.

But the short answer is that Biden is doing way better than Clinton in almost every area. In part because the national environment is way more favorable to him, he's looking in pretty good shape to win Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, possibly Florida, maybe even Georgia and Texas. That's a huge bump from where Clinton was in all those states.

And he hasn't really lost any ground either. Biden's not exactly got New Hampshire locked up, and it's possible for him to lose Nevada, but overall he's more likely to win both of those than he is to lose them."
729,Ask_Politics,What if the former Republican nominees for President came out against Trump?,"Cindy McCain endorsed Biden at the DNC. I think the others refusal to endorse Trump is just as good as an endorsement for Biden.

As already noted, Trump supporters won't care if Bush, Romney or Dole endorsed Biden at this point, although it might encourage some anti-Trump Republicans to not sit out this election."
730,Ask_Politics,"Aside from voting, what can I, as a middle-class white male, do to improve the state of the USA?","This year there's going to be a shortage of poll workers most likely.

731,Ask_Politics,Should government officials be allowed to lie to the public?,"The problem with making lying illegal is that everyone lies dozens of times per day. It just wouldn't work.

732,Ask_Politics,How could we abolish/eliminate gerrymandering in the US?,Some states have eliminated it by having Congressional districts drawn by an independent commission with members from both parties as well as non-aligned members.

734,Ask_Politics,Is this postal service fiasco a genuine threat to the election?,"A major issue is speed.

Americans are used to getting the results of an election on election night. A high volume of mail-in ballots could mean no results for a week or more. A few primaries in NY were not settled until five weeks later because they weren’t prepared for the volume. 

If on election night it looks like one candidate it winning, then a week later mail in ballots tip the election to another candidate, a lot of people are going to go nuts.

Add to this that both campaigns have been hiring armies of lawyers. Prepare for a lot of legal challenges — like 2000’s Miami-Dade but dozens of them across the country.

There’s a lot of ways mail in ballots can be challenged. If the post office is unprepared, very often ballots are not post marked correctly. It’s not settled if this invalidates a ballot. And unlike in person ballots, mail in ballots can be invalidated if the signature does not match the signature of file. This can be up to some interpretation. People’s handwriting changes over time."

737,Ask_Politics,"If DC gets full Statehood in 2021, will both Senate seats be up for election at the same time?","They would have an election for two senators with no one knowing which class they would be a part of. In the case of a 51st State, one will be part of class 1 (up for reelection in 2024) and class 2 (2026) and serve the remainder of those terms until then.

Class 1 and 2 have 33 Senators each while class 3 has 34 Senators, so it will be those two classes. Traditionally after the election a coin toss decides which class the two newly elected Senators are in."

You can’t legally target black people by targeting them individually, by the color of their skin, but you can often legally target them by targeting the places they live.

Same thing happens with jerrymandering, redlining, and overpolicing."
741,Ask_Politics,Why is no one talking about the protests in Iraq?,"China is a geopolitical competitor to the United States, so media coverage of Chinese internal strife is magnified in U.S. media. It's also riskless for most people in the US to criticize China, so people join the bandwagon very easily. Over the last 10 years or so, and especially over the last 3, China's geopolitical position has improved while the US's has gotten somewhat worse. Hence it is important for US strategic interests to try and keep it as an international pariah.

Iraq is a US ally and internal strife in Iraq makes the US look bad, because the US was so involved in Iraqi internal affairs (to put it mildly) over the last 15 years.  The media in the US has reported on Iraqi struggles for so long that people have become desensitized to it and just don't care as much. It's not risky to criticize Iraq in the US, but interest in the region has waned so much that few people are listening."

744,Ask_Politics,Can someone give me a synopsis of what happened at last night’s Presidential debate?,"The debate was widely considered to be difficult to watch and often incomprehensible due to the near-constant interruptions. The debate covered [six topics](https://youtu.be/9HnKFUNlcfY?t=1890):

* Candidates' Records
* Supreme Court
* Coronavirus
* Economy
* Race & Violence
* Election Integrity

**Varied Debate Strategies:**

President Trump's strategy appeared to be to poke and prod at Biden until he cracked. This is not unlike his strategies in the 2016 presidential election. His remarks were punctuated with his standard [lies and exaggerations](https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/sep/30/fact-checking-first-2020-presidential-debate-joe-b/). Biden appeared to take the bait several times, once exclaiming, ""[Will you shut up, man?](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/will-you-shut-up-man-trump-biden-first-debate-personal-jabs/)"" 

**Personal Attacks:**

These frequent interruptions often devolved into ad-hominem jousting between the two candidates. Trump interrupted Biden at one point to comment on Biden's intelligence, telling him ""[don't ever use the word 'smart' with me, Joe. There's nothing smart about you.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-fires-back-at-biden-telling-him-to-get-smarter-dont-ever-use-the-word-smart-with-me)"" At another point, Biden flatly said President Trump was the [worst President in American History](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/sep/30/biden-tells-trump-you-are-the-worst-president-america-has-ever-had-in-battle-over-taxes-video). These attacks came fast and furious over the course of the debate, punctuating what some believe was a [net loss for the American people](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/09/who-wins-an-unwatchable-debate/).

**Examples:**

Here are a few topics addressed in last night's debate:

Biden highlighted his ""[Biden plan](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-biden-issues-climate-change-environment/story?id=73151337)"" for climate change, and while President Trump expressed doubt in scientific knowledge about it, he emphasized his desire for ""[crystal clean water and air.](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/09/30/climate-change-first-debate-full-video-2020-dbx-vpx.cnn)"" President Trump stuck to the idea that his plan would make cars cheaper and safer while Biden defended his proposal for $2 Trillion in green jobs, limits on fracking, ending the use of fossil fuels, etc.

During the section on healthcare, [Trump talked in general terms](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-09-30/debate-trump-biden-healthcare-plan-nonexistent) about his plan to replace the Affordable Care Act with a ""better"" version. Biden explained he would like to expand on the Affordable Care Act and discussed how people would lose coverage under President Trump's plan.

Biden expressed his belief that Congress should wait until after the election to hear the case on a [Supreme Court nominee](https://youtu.be/9HnKFUNlcfY?t=2160), while Trump explained that there was ""no way"" the Democrats would wait if they were given the chance to nominate a Supreme Court justice.

When it came time to discuss election integriy, President Trump refused to answer Chris Wallace's question, ""what are you going to do about it?"" and instead used his time to [stoke fears about it](https://youtu.be/9HnKFUNlcfY?t=7292). When asked if Biden would ask his supporters to be calm and not declare victory until all the ballots were counted, he answered succinctly: [yes](https://youtu.be/9HnKFUNlcfY?t=7573).

It was a messy debate, but the primary takeaway for most people was that the debate format was flawed. Many called for the moderator to have the ability to shut off a candidate's mic. The Commission on Presidential Debates has [promised to review](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/09/30/us/presidential-debate) the format for the subsequent debates."
745,Ask_Politics,Can a U.S. Presidential Pardon be revoked or overruled by a later POTUS or SCOTUS?,"SCOTUS- The pardon is a check on the judiciary and the courts have no constitutional authority to overrule a pardon.

POTUS- I've seen answers to this that go between yes no and maybe. But Grant rescinded two pardons that Andrew Johnson had given. Andrew Johnson issued the two pardons, and “sent” them. The two pardons apparently were passed through the chain of command, but when they reached the desk of the warden of the actual prison where both men were being held, the warden apparently “allowed them to sit on his desk.” The ""pardoned"" individuals sued in court but the court ruled in Grant's favor saying that the President can, ""arrest such mission at any time before the messenger delivers the pardon to the warden of the prison."" FYI Grant later granted the pardons.

IANAL but if I had a client and they were pardoned by the President, and the next President reversed his pardon I would argue first that no ""person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb"" under the Eighth Amendment, and that perhaps the res judicata doctrine would apply since a pardon ends imprisonment."
746,Ask_Politics,Is America going to be Flip-Flopping Between Blue and Red Presidents Forever?,"People just get tired of having the same party in control of the country after a while. Also, if the incumbent party candidate isn’t seen as exciting or interesting, many times people won’t bother to vote for the candidate after an 8 year term. There’s not really a lot of motivation to do so whereas the opposition might be energized to get the party “out”."
747,Ask_Politics,"I realize this sounds a little basic, but Conservatives mention how there is a homeless problem in CA and how people are moving to red states like FL, TX and AZ. Can't 80% of this be explained by the climate?","There's some legit issues in California. A big one is the unwillingness to let affordable housing be built. You've got some proposals by neoliberals like Scott Weiner in the CA legislature to make it easier to build affordable housing, but an informal alliance of the right (who like to complain about the potential for affordable housing to lower wealthier people's property values) and the left (who seem to complain that any proposals - other than rent control, which actually lowers supply of housing - to alleviate the housing issues are just ""gentrification"") have repeatedly stood in the way of Weiner's proposals

There's other factors too, but this plays a big role in California, there'd be less homelessness and people moving out if the left and right would stop standing in the way of expanding affordable housing"
748,Ask_Politics,"How did the word “liberal,” in North America, become associated with left leaning people, in contrast to the original meaning of people who supported free markets?","FDR marketed himself as ""liberal"" as a campaign strategy to distinguish his politics from those of the Republican Party, because the early progressive movement in the US had supporters in both the Republican and Democratic parties.

FDR won the 1932 presidential election and the liberal branding got applied to his administration, particularly to the New Deal programs which dramatically expanded the involvement of the Federal government in social welfare policies. Most opponents of FDR's and other Democrats' policies policies going forward were happy to use the label of ""liberalism"" to identify the target of their ire, leaving only a few pedants like me who bother to quibble about the distinction between ""classical liberalism"" and modern ""social liberalism"".

Ask this question of an Australian sometime. They've mutilated the word even worse than we have."
749,Ask_Politics,"Professor Allan Lichtman has made his prediction for 2020, how reliable and valid is his model?","Winning the popular vote is a given for Biden. Republicans have lost the popular vote in every election since 1988 except for Bush Jr's re-election, fuelled by post-9/11 patriotism. 

A model that predicts Electoral College outcomes would be worth a critical deep-dive."
750,Ask_Politics,"The Trump administration is ignoring subpoenas for documents and for people to testify, so why doesn’t the House arrest people who are refusing to testify?","Democrats have decided to pursue impeachment for a number of reasons. A principal motivation is an impeachment process is a highly dramatic, public spectacle that [a majority of Americans support carrying out](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/impeachment-polls/) (that is — a majority support holding the inquiry and holding hearings, but a majority do not support removing Trump).

However, [only 43% approve of the way Democrats have handled the impeachment process](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/10/21/rel12a.-.trump,.impeachment.pdf). Polls like this have likely led to Democrats moderating their approach. 

As Democrats carry out the inquiry, they are keeping a very close eye on what moderates and undecided voters in 2020 swing districts think. If Democrats are not pursuing the inquiry as aggressively as they could be, it’s very likely that this is because internal polling and House Democrats from swing districts are telling them that those techniques will not play well for that audience.

Edit— Just wanted to add that the impeachment process only became popular after Democrats decided to pursue it. So one can make the case that ignoring the polls might be the best way to raise the polling numbers. 

But right now I think it makes sense for Democrats to take on the image if not the actual role of restrained and neutral arbiters. Sending the sergeant-at-arms to arrest members of the executive is the kind of extreme measure that plays into the White House “witch hunt” narrative.” Probably better to let the White House continue to seem like it has something to hide by letting them stonewall."

752,Ask_Politics,"If Prince Andrew went to the US for interview as was arrested, what would be the political ramifications between the US and UK?","The Royal Family doesn't have diplomatic immunity, which is limited to diplomats and their families, but they do have immunity in UK courts which is known as sovereign immunity, and heads of state & governments have protection in foreign courts through the doctrine of state immunity. [Wikipedia breakdown here.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity)

However these immunities are limited to a fairly close circle around the Queen as head of state. Regarding other types of immunity, unless a particular royal was on a visit acting for the UK government, it's unlikely that they would be able to claim what's called [Special mission immunity. ](https://redress.org/casework/generalhegazycase/)

There's a good summary of the [immunity issues here,](https://www.corkerbinning.com/could-prince-andrew-be-extradited-to-the-us-on-sex-trafficking-charges/) although it's based on a hypothetical US extradition request. 

If Prince Andrew visited the US, it seems there's very little protection in law, unless the UK government chose to recognise him as a diplomat first. Which is why he's incredibly unlikely to ever go to the US again.

However as the previous article mentions, it's more of a diplomatic issue than a legal one."

Making college free for this population would cost about $600 billion. Also, more people than those 20 million would attend if it were free.

758,Ask_Politics,"Why are members of Congress deemed “essential personnel” and still payed over the Christmas break, despite not working and arguably being the source of the federal shutdown?","In OPM parlance, Congress isn't ""excepted,"" they're *exempt*. Congressional salaries are not paid from annual appropriations, but from a permanent appropriation.

Even if they were appropriated annually, members of Congress are entitled to pay based on their status as members, not based on hours worked. A shutdown happens because most federal employees are entitled to pay based on hours worked, so working means the government owes you money. If your pay is status-based, working doesn't mean you're owed anything additional, so you can still work.

Even if that wasn't the case, members of Congress are constitutional officers. They *cannot* be prevented from carrying out their constitutional duties except as allowed in the Constitution. The President and life-tenured federal judges are also constitutional officers and also cannot be prevented from carrying out their duties except as allowed in the Constitution. All three groups are also constitutionally entitled to a salary. 

Even if that weren't true, a shutdown cannot end without Congress passing a law. They're arguably some of the *most* essential people in a shutdown, because only they can end it."
759,Ask_Politics,Why do Democrats keep failing to replicate the New Deal coalition that helped them win elections by landslides in the 20th century?,"Because that coalition was unsustainable in the long run. You had Segregationists, African Americans, Urban Workers, Farmers, Business men and unions in the same party. All of these people have radically different interests and needs. 

They came together because they supported FDR’s New Deal economic recovery. Imagine trying to hold together a coalition of segregationists and African Americans. Which side do you push for? Or Unions and Businesses. You’re constantly running the risk of angering someone with any policy. 

Also, FDR was extremely charismatic and was getting results. People suffering during the depression were seeing a difference in their lifestyles. Truman ran on his legacy. They were able to hold the presidency for 20 years from 1932 to 1952, then they had President Eisenhower who despite being a Republican wasn’t ideologically opposed to New Deal Policies. 

By JFK’s election it had started to fall apart. Kennedy pushing for MLK to be freed and campaigning with black voters was a clear signal that this coalition could not continue for long. During his election a bunch of Southern Democrats peeled off and voted for Senator Byrd, a segregationist even though he wasn’t running for President. The chaos of the 68 Convention was the just last nail in its coffin. 

It’s not something that can be replicated today by Democrats because appealing to Southern White voters using racial tactics would cause them to lose one of their biggest constituencies in African Americans. Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden both have close ties to their community. Barack Obama for obvious reasons couldn’t appeal to them.

765,Ask_Politics,Does Amy McGrath have a chance against McConnell for the Kentucky senate?,"There are a couple factors here influencing this answer. Number one, increasingly we're seeing that the party that wins the presidential vote also wins the down ballot votes. So even if McGrath is polling alright, Trump is still heavily favored in Kentucky. This might be undermined slightly by Trump falling in the polls recently, and if the current environment for him persists into November (not at all a given), then you may see this trend weaken. But I wouldn't hold my breath too much.

The other factor is that we don't have a lot of polling for this race. Since August of 2019, there's only been four total polls for this race according to 538. This is not nearly enough of a sample to state conclusively what is going on this race. The good news for McGrath is that the polls have been fairly consistently giving the race a basically break even chance, even with Trump's lead, but again it's really hard to tell how much that will show up in the actual ballot box.

One thing that would help us get a better idea is to look back at previous elections for McConnell--has he consistently shown about even polling numbers in election year, only to win his seat anyway by a larger margin? Or is he performing worse than he has historically? I don't know the answer, but weaker numbers this year COULD indicate that McConnell is genuinely weaker than he has been in the past.

Overall, I'd say McGrath is a pretty good candidate. Unseating a Rep in a deep red state with his kind of tenure is not easy, and the fact that she's polling basically even right now is likely quite an accomplishment. However, I haven't seen too much chatter from elections experts about this race, meaning that it's probably not as close as we might think, especially when you consider the presidential effect I mentioned above.

Just keep in mind, a McGrath +1 poll is basically the same as McConnell +3 poll. That 4% shift isn't nothing, but it basically moves her chances incrementally forward and even if those polls are spot on accurate the race is at best a toss up. Again, that's still an accomplishment considering she's up against the most powerful Rep in the Senate majority, but we're a long way away from getting too excited."

Boastful on the occasion of Memorial Day, President Donald Trump and his Veterans Affairs secretary are claiming full credit for health care improvements that were underway before they took office.

Trump said he passed a private-sector health care program, Veterans Choice, after failed attempts by past presidents for the last “45 years.” That’s not true. The Choice program, which allows veterans to see doctors outside the government-run VA system at taxpayer expense, was first passed in 2014 under President Barack Obama.

769,Ask_Politics,How will ranked choice voting affect the election in Maine?,"Left-wing independent Savage and right-wing independent Linn are both on the ballot.  Both are polling at around 3%.

Savage is telling her supporters to vote for her first and Gideon second. Meanwhile several Republicans I've talked to don't trust RCV and think it's a scam, and so they plan to only rank their top candidate. We might see a chunk of Linn voters not put Collins second.

In the presidential race, I'd wager RCV will help Biden with Hawkins voters. A lot of Bernie-or-bust voters feel that it's a betrayal of their values to vote *for* Biden, but they might be willing to *rank* Biden higher than Trump.  No clue who the Jorgensen voters will go for.

Enthusiasm can translate to people standing in line to vote or canvassing around town to get the vote out, but the article also mentioned the energy to vote AGAINST Trump.

In my opinion: I don't think the shelter-in-place is helping him and more eyes will be on the official nomination and eventual VP pick. Seems it's much more valuable this year than other years.

773,Ask_Politics,Why doesn’t Social Security simply function as a UBI for seniors?,"Another way to look at it is a ""social insurance program"".

Like any insurance, you may get more money out than you paid in, you may get less, but it's about stabilization and preventing catastrophe, not making a profit. 

Suppose you're 18, you've paid car insurance for 6 months, and you crash a brand new $25,000 car. Insurance buys you a new car, so minus the 6 months of insurance you've paid , you ""make"" $23,000. 

Suppose you're 50, you've had car insurance for all of your driving career, as required by law. Somebody t-bones your 12 year old Toyota Camry, and insurance pays you the $1500 they say it's worth. Well, totalling all the insurance premiums you've paid over the past 42 years, you've ""lost"" $50,000 dollars. 

But that's a dumb way of looking at insurance-- it's not about making money, or a return on investment. It's about preventing calamity, so that if you have a major accident and spend two weeks in the hospital and a year in physical rehabilitation, you don't owe $200,000 to the hospital for all that. 

Or if you are a store owner, and some maniac drives their car into your store window, their insurance pays for all the damage, remodeling, and loss of business, instead of this idiot who has no money and couldn't pay you anything anyways. Everybody pays in a little, regularly, so that nobody has to pay out a lot, ever.

So, social security is a kind of *insurance*. You pay into it all of your working career, but if you die at age 62, you get nothing out of it. Just like the safe driver who never has an accident. 

Or, you could die at age 50, and have a spouse and four children who get your social security survivors benefits, and maybe it totals out to more than you paid in your whole life. So they ""make money"" on it. 

Long short, when social security was set up almost 100 years ago, it was modeled to be more like an insurance program than a guaranteed benefit. I'm not even sure the idea of guaranteed income was around back then."
774,Ask_Politics,Are there any polls showing the demographic breakdown of the GOP along pro- vs. anti-Trump lines?,"Just read on Yahoo News that there is a [good possibility that Republicans are considering a break-away third party](https://www.yahoo.com/news/more-100-republican-former-officials-031100619.html) that would be a traditional type of GOP (versus the libertarians) and would end up destroying the Dixiecrat Republicans of Trump. 

While they would never become Democrats, they see the Democrats coming towards their philosophy, but today's far right is too busy obstructing that it's difficult to actually govern when the only game plan is obstruction. While we see party defecters every election cycle, this past cycle was the warning shots over the bow to the GOP with the Lincoln Project. I suspect that the party break will come much like it did back in the 1800s, when they became the Know Nothings evolved into the GOP as Lincoln led. 

The article itself points out that there are about 100 influential Republicans behind this, but the working word is influential. 

It will be an uphill battle as a third party, let's call them The Conservative Party, takes away from the current GOP. There are plenty of rational Republicans that want to govern but can't because party unity is the ballywick they are beaten with.  Even if they have to take major losses over the next decade or two, they would be willing to take it. Or they could swallow their pride and move over to the Libertarian party. No matter how they do it, it will be similar to when TR ran as a 3rd party against the GOP in 1912, or George Wallace when he split and ran against HHH. 

No matter what, the GOP as it sits is in jeopardy. If only 25% of the current Republicans defected to the third party, that would hurt, but of late, the current GOP would rather cut off it's trunk to spite it's face.

I'm going to invoke Godwin's law here as he changed it due to Trump: There is a tradition in many newsgroups and other Internet discussion forums that, when a Hitler comparison is made, the thread is finished and whoever made the comparison loses whatever debate is in progress. American politics had changed drastically over the previous quarter century from when he first postulated it. By 2015 and the rise of Donald Trump, he said, ""If you're thoughtful about it and show some real awareness of history, go ahead and refer to Hitler when you talk about Trump, or any other politician."" then further clarified it in a 2018 LA Times op-ed by saying: ""should function less as a conversation ender and more as a conversation starter.""  That said, there are enough Republicans, using their fear based bias, that see the rise of Trump and his denial of losing the election along the same lines as Hitler's rise to power. 

The demographics aren't complete, but when I point to The Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group of Republicans. They raised over $87 million to fight Trump and other GOP candidates, and their expenditures were under $81 million. That means, come mid-terms, they already have \~$6 million to start with to fight Trump supporters. Right now, they're trying to save the party, but in the long run, they'll realize they will need to spin off a new party that will put the current GOP mostly powerful in the former CSA states."
775,Ask_Politics,"In a nutshell, can someone explain what the new Senate Intel report means ??","The report by bi-partisan support found that Russia did meddle in our 2016 election. Paul Manafort was mentioned to be a counter intelligence risk due to his connections with a Russian agent: Konstantin Kilimnik.

The report also details how Roger Stone, via intermediary, got WikiLeaks to release hacked DNC emails when the infamous Access Hollywood tape on Trump was released.

They also made recommendations for tighter laws against foreign interference in presidential elections. As well as tougher restrictions on candidates seeking and giving information to foreign entities.

The report also found the FBI did some questionable actions with extending FISA warrants with the Steele dossier.

I will not speak to the implications to Trump directly as the report does not touch about the President directly. Anyone telling you he is corrupt or less corrupt because of it is not presenting facts but rather their opinion. The only things we know are: people in Trumps campaign did some shady dealings that COULD have compromised them to foreign entities and that the FBI did some shady requests for warrants. It does not in any way ties Trump to anything done BUT it does not clear his name either. Like I said before the final call to action is mainly surrounding strengthening election laws such that there can be no chance of foreign interference in the future

EDIT:
There is one more point that the FBI was negligent in giving the DNC enough warning on their emails being hacked. But there are also reports that DNC didn’t take the limited warnings given seriously. The takeaway being FBI should have escalated that development and DNC should have pursued harder on the warnings"
776,Ask_Politics,Why isn't there an FDIC sort of federal insurance set up for crucial businesses such as airlines so if a major economic downturn happens they can be paid out of their insurance instead of being bailed out?,"The FDIC protects depositors, not the banks. For an airline they are not supposed to use your ticket money before your flight. So if there is no fraud if the airline fails you get your money back. And you can't insure against your own fraud.

778,Ask_Politics,Why is conservatism so popular in the United States?,"A little bit less of a ""hot take"" than most of these comments: 

If you live in a high density area, you're naturally going to see problems as collective problems which require collective solutions, because that's the reality that's front and center in your face. If you live in a low density area, you're more likely to see problems as more individual problems that are yours to solve (while other people's problems are theirs to solve), and large collective efforts are just getting in the way. 

Conservatism lends itself to individual problem solving, liberalism to collective problem solving. 

The US has a *very* spread out population. We rank 145th in population density.  The physical space between people lends itself to conservatism."
779,Ask_Politics,Does anyone know anything new about a second stimulus package?,"The Senate GOP is introducing a procedural vote this week on their own ""skinny bill"" which will cost anywhere from $500-$750 billion dollars. The is significantly less than the $3 trillion dollar stimulus the Democrats proposed and less than the $1 trillion dollar stimulus economists expected. The outcome of this procedural vote is far from certain with Senate Republicans still negotiating among themselves to reach the 51 votes necessary to pass the procedural vote. If the procedural vote is successful the bill will likely be brought up for the entire Senate to vote on in the next several weeks. However, there is currently no reason to believe that bill, even if it passes the procedural vote, will reach the 60 vote threshold to defeat a Democratic filibuster.   


Mitch McConnell has been facing pressure from vulnerable members of the Senate up for reelection to hold a vote on another Corona stimulus. There are 12-15 Republican Senators who have no intention of voting for any stimulus package in its final form which effectively means any GOP crafted bill will have to gain a sizeable amount of Democratic support if it has any chance of passing the Senate. The Senate GOP has been unwilling to make any concessions towards Democrats to gain their support which has resulted in negotiations effectively breaking down entirely.   


As the election grows closer (8 weeks) the chances of a second stimulus package is increasingly unlikely. The optimistic job reports out last week has also further disincentivized Republicans from cutting a deal. Republicans are feeling increasingly optimistic that their ""Reopen America"" strategy is working and are increasingly more concerned with the growing budget deficits than providing any further stimulus. The White House and Republicans in Congress are [publicly stating that they believe the economy](https://www.ft.com/content/363eb1a2-f211-4fed-8b9e-c572433cafa1) is on a path towards self-recovery and that a second stimulus, while helpful, is no longer actually needed.   


At this point any individuals or firms holding out hope for a second aid package should begin operating on the assumption that one will not be coming. Things could change in the coming weeks depending on how this issue effects polling but unless that happens it looks very unlikely another stimulus will pass."
780,Ask_Politics,Why is it that a prosecutor can’t indict a sitting US president?,"I’m a lawyer. A prosecutor CAN indict a sitting president. In fact, at the state level, the most recent Supreme Court ruling re: New York State and Trump’s tax returns (Trump v Vance) indicates the president will be subject to criminal proceedings at the New York state level.

But we have two levels of law—state and federal. At the federal level, justice department policy prohibits the indictment of a sitting president. This is something of an extension of the SCOTUS decision in Nixon vs. Fitzgerald, which establishes “absolute immunity” for a sitting president from lawsuit (not criminal charges—there is a difference, one is civil law the other is criminal) for acts committed while in office. This does not extend to acts committed before he becomes president, as later clarified by the court in Clinton v. Jones.

So what was the rationale for this civil immunity? The belief, now proven utterly incorrect, was that the president would be sufficiently checked via other powers, such as impeachment and the scrutiny of a free press. Just to show you how far we have fallen—that was believed to be such a fool proof mechanism, that people would engage in good, honest behavior, that the Supreme Court deemed it sufficient deterrent. Suing the president also distracted from the duties of his office, and in that sense, one is “suing the people” and their right to continuity of undistracted governance. The court made a point to distinguish this from criminal law and specifically noted that the immunity DID NOT extend to criminal misconduct by the president.

This immunity is similar to other scenarios in the law as a form of “sovereign immunity”, the idea that you may not sue the state or certain employees for their official acts, as the real party being sued is “the people” and their tax dollars. Lawsuits are fundamentally about curing damages monetarily, so the money provided is from taxpayer funds.

So why now will the justice department not indict the president? It again ties back to Nixon, this time more specifically Watergate. The justice department drafted an internal memo deciding that charging the president would be “unconstitutional” in violation of separation of powers. This was reaffirmed in 2000 upon review via another internal memo, but I’m not sure an independent justice department run by a legitimate attorney general would have upheld that policy regarding Trump’s crimes. I haven’t read the memos, but I assume the reasons were similar to the decision in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, though it’s important to know it goes AGAINST the Supreme Court’s distinction in that case that the president should be subject to criminal prosecution.

To be clear about this—because of the hierarchical structure, the final say on this is with the attorney general, rather than a diligent federal prosecutor, and any attempts to indict would be shot down and met with retaliation (despite that being illegal). Barr is not operating in good faith, he has a stranglehold on the department of justice and has jeopardized its independence. Line prosecutors and department employees work in fear of Barr and the president. He is the attorney general that Nixon dreamed of having, the one who wouldn’t resign and would have done all the dirty work needed to turn him into a king. The oversight for the attorney general rolls up to the president, so the system is essentially broken at this point. When two parties have oversight of each other, it’s impossible for either to oversee. The tiebreaker is supposed to be the Congress, but because of republican obstructionism and a bizarre confluence of events that check failed. Republicans can’t compete for power with the democrats anymore on a level playing field given demographic changes, and the Republican Party is relying more and more on appealing to its extremist base and suppressing votes to maintain their offices. The senators who would oversee this have essentially refused to do so as a result, because they don’t want to lose office, knowing removing the president would alienate all of their voters.

BUT the state legal system doesn’t have these restrictions, which makes the tax return and financial document case SCOTUS just decided so interesting. There probably isn’t time but Trump could theoretically be indicted in New York before the election. He also loses immunity when he leaves office, and can be prosecuted then.

The right successfully argued that the best response to the poverty and insecurity that arose from those economic circumstances was social retrenchment (anti-immigration policies coupled with economic austerity and the dissolution of some aspects of the social safety net), while the left has undergone something of an identity crisis, splitting itself between a leftist / socialist faction and a moderate / centrist faction, neither of which have proven themselves to be electorially up to the job and neither of which have grasped the nettle on a popular narrative around how to respond to 2008."
785,Ask_Politics,Is it a good idea to vote by mail in the upcoming US presidential election?,"Washington State only does mail voting.  Included on our ballot is a ballot ID and links to where you can review that your vote was tallied as you intended.  

The notion that voting by mail is risky is fabricated in a direct effort to disenfranchise.  And there are easy ways to solve it but nobody is talking about solutions because Republicans aren't interested in solving it, just scaring people away for political purposes."

787,Ask_Politics,"What can China realistically do to ""stop"" the UK and Australia from granting residency/citizenship to Hong Kong citizens?","They can physically prevent them from leaving, which presumably they are already doing. Mainland Chinese can't leave China without the permission of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP is very serious about this. They **will** imprison and murder Chinese nationals who try to leave without permission.

Those who manage to leave will also likely be robbed completely, with any significant assets seized by the CCP. 

And it's not just the individual who is at risk. Any family members who stay in China will be subject to punishment, imprisonment, murder, etc."
788,Ask_Politics,Could the Police be separated into Public Safety / Security and Law Enforcement?,"How about we train cops that their primary job is as safety officers and that the care and well being of citizens is paramount? You cannot control their environment. You can train them how to react to their environment. In the UK,  [the cops don't kill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9TFvh6Xps4) at the drop of a hat. Here's  [a machete wielding man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mzPj_IaMzY) being taken down with concerted and trained response.

The idea you want is counter to the present mindset of police. My ideas and your ideas will not work because, and let's be 100% honest, the police in the US do not WANT to change.  They are more willing to beat people in the streets than accept that change is needed."
789,Ask_Politics,"Who are the three doctors who have ""fallen "" out of windows in Russia?","According to reports on Twitter, two of the doctors had spoken out about shortages in PPE.

790,Ask_Politics,Why does the President of the USA have a *private* lawyer doing actual high-level activities on behalf of the government?,"Ok just speaking in general - and not about Giuliani specifically.


Presidents use special envoys for international outreach all the time. Some are trusted friends, some are lawyers, some have specific experience, etc.


For example Obama used a personal lawyer (Deputy Associate Council to Obama himself) as a special envoy to the OIC.

791,Ask_Politics,Is there a partisan divide in opinions on whether Epstein killed himself?,"It's not being prone to theory, but what he was planning for when ""suddenly"" he changed mind and committed ""suicide"". He was planning to release information on powerful figures.

Less than 24 hours before his death, his cellmate was abruptly ""transferred"" and no one else was brought in to replace him.

He was on suicide watch but both cameras facing his cell were ""not recording"". A third camera had footage that could not be ""retrieved"".

Guard was supposed to check cell every 30 mins. That did not happen throughout the night (10:30 PM was last check and next was at 6:30 AM when they found him dead).

He was found in a kneeling position with a strip of bedsheet wrapped around his neck. The sheet was tied to the top of his bunk. He was 6 feet tall and bed is not that high from floor.

Additional details (from wikipedia):

The evening of his death, Epstein met with his lawyers, who described him as ""upbeat""

The New York City medical examiner ruled Epstein's death a suicide. Epstein's lawyers challenged that conclusion and opened their own investigation. Epstein's brother Mark hired Michael Baden to oversee the autopsy. In late October, Baden announced that autopsy evidence was more indicative of homicidal strangulation than suicidal hanging. Both the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice's inspector general conducted investigations into the circumstances of his death, and the guards on duty were later charged with conspiracy and record falsification."
792,Ask_Politics,Can Trump rebound from his terrible poll numbers to eek out 270 electoral votes against Joe Biden in November?,No way to know.  Look 40% of the voting eligible  people didn't bother to vote.     If either side can get some of those people to vote for them everything changes.
793,Ask_Politics,Why do some people think the elite are left wing?,"""Elite"" is a broad word. Many people would say ivory tower intellectuals are rather elitist. But your definition of elite would focus more on people with power and status, and professors don't usually have either (though Noah Feldman made an excellent case for both in the impeachment trials). Historically, the people with power and wealth usually were the ivory tower intellectuals because only noblemen could afford education. 

What you're also forgetting is that the business elites that you are referring to can often use their power and status to create PR that portrays them significantly differently. Even if ivory tower intellectuals had the inclination to do so, they certainly lack the means."
794,Ask_Politics,Should Election Day in the US be a federal holiday?,"No. Just because it's a holiday doesn't mean everyone has the day off.

Places like gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacies, fast food, and other low-wage establishments often don't close on holidays. This means that the only people that will see the benefit of a holiday are already well off enough to put voting into their schedule. In fact, making it easier for them will disenfranchise the poor even further by yet further tipping the scales in their favor of power. "
795,Ask_Politics,What are the arguments for keeping marijuana illegal for personal use/consumption?,"Broadly speaking, there aren't too many good arguments left. It was originally done so as part of the war on drugs, specifically to associate hippies with criminality, and largely that battle has been lost. No longer is it largely considered a ""gateway drug"" and the effects are clearly not as dangerous as less regulated substances.

It is however a bit of a cultural icon, still, especially among older conservative folks, and so it's used as part of a broader argument about keeping society the way it should be. That argument hasn't entirely lost all power, though it has lost most of it.

EDIT: There's a reason neither party is really pushing this issue. The Dems know they've won and there's no point in riling up folks who are upset about that. The Reps know they've lost and aren't willing to expend political capital on a ship that's sinking. Jeff Sessions was the last guy who's cared about this since Bush II (more or less) and he's not even popular enough to win a primary any more.

EDIT: As some users have pointed out, the weed issue actually predates the war on drugs. However, the war on drugs DID escalate it well beyond what it had been before."
796,Ask_Politics,Does the media usually ignore when people faint at rallys?,"Hey - a question at the intersection of my political and EMT backgrounds!

Unfortunately, people fainting at rallies (and concerts, church services, protests, and other similarly situated events) IS pretty common.  It can be hot. You often end up standing for a really long time.  Politicians' schedules get screwy all the time and they can end up being HOURS late.  Plus it's not necessarily an event people prepare for by hydrating and eating.    And - this is really the key - people have a terrible habit of locking their knees when standing for a long time, which can restrict blood flow to the brain and cause fainting.

Can't comment on Trump's reaction since I didn't see it, but yeah, that happens all the freaking time."

798,Ask_Politics,"Why are William Barr, Mike Pompeo, and Sebastian Gorka all in Rome right now?","They’re probably looking for help from the Italian government to advance the narrative that [Joseph Mifsud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Mifsud?wprov=sfti1) (a Maltese professor of education and ex Maltese foreign minister who is linked to several Russian oligarchs) was acting at the behest of Hillary Clinton or the DNC or George Soros or the “deep state” when he told Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos that he could put him in touch with Russian agents if he wanted access to Hillary’s emails.

Here’s an extremely shady blog (it does not disclose who owns it, among other red flags) advancing this theory: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/italy-sacks-intel-chiefs-over-mifsud-brennan-russia-hoax-fiasco-119822/amp/ 

During the Mueller investigation Mifsud inexplicably disappeared. Many assumed he had been killed. Recent reports (April 2019) however, suggest he is alive and living under a false identity in Rome."
799,Ask_Politics,"Stacey Abrams is openly vying for Biden's VP spot.

801,Ask_Politics,"Why do Moderate Democrats get scared of Bernie's plans, when he would have to make huge compromises even among his own party to get his ideas passed through Congress?","Well the fear isn't that his stuff will happen, more that it won't happen at all. Basically, the concern is that Bernie is divisive enough to damage the party's unity but not strong enough to reunite it in his image.

A good parallel is Trump, actually. He broke down the party's previous moderate platform that was held by front runners Rubio, Cruz, Kasich and so on in 2016. Initially, Reps were VERY scared, with everyone in the party denouncing Trump and doing their best to slow his momentum. But he kept steamrolling, running over the moderates and turning his vision for the party into the party establishment. This is what it looks like when an anti-establishment candidate is successful.

So for Bernie, the fact that he's railing against the establishment and getting a strong base, but struggling to turn that energized base into a broad coalition that will win an election, is a scary middle ground to be. If Bernie just won outright, with Biden, Klobuchar, Harris, and so on fading into the background and Bernie grabbing up those voters, you'd see Dems hesitantly but meekly jumping on board just like we saw with Trump. But instead, Harris has faded because she ran a bad campaign, Klobuchar somehow went from dead in the water to maybe still kicking, and even though Biden is decisively slumping, Buttigieg has risen as a new moderate that has some potential. Increasingly, the writing is on the wall that Bernie's base is as large as his coalition will get. And that does cause some problems for Dems because Bernie's base is large enough to have significant sway in the party but not large enough to take control, and so far that base's most dedicated message has been about the shortcomings of the party."
802,Ask_Politics,Have Republicans always been skeptical of the existence of climate change?,"The Environmental Protection Agency was formed, oddly enough,  under the Nixon administration.  However, the buzz word back then was ""ecology"", and it was more about the existence of pollution.  Climate change is much newer, and focuses on the damage the pollution has on our environment.  The right has its share of deniers,  who IMO, are more in favor of corporate deregulation at the expense of the planet. It's easier to rationalize the allowance of industrial pollution if you deny its effects on the health of Mother Nature"
803,Ask_Politics,Why is abortion such a big deal in the US?,"The US is, on average, more religious than most other first world countries. We also oppose assisted suicide more ardently."
804,Ask_Politics,Why does any politician sits down to talk to Bob Woodward?,"In his last book on Trump, he had a similar amount of incredible, on the record, interviews. The book has a little forward in which Woodward details his process for getting these huge interviews. 

According to him, he simply asks a lot of people, and the ones who want to talk, will talk. From that he will piece the story together. He had Rob Portman, Don McGahn, Reince Preibus, and Bannon extensively. Apparently, he asked for interviews, and those guys just talked, and talked, and talked. The subtext being they each had their own agenda against other palace rivals that they wanted to air out. 

This time, Trump was pissed that he wasn’t interviewed personally for the first book, thought he came off poorly, so he decided to fix that himself this time around. Nailed it."

806,Ask_Politics,Why is California experiencing a record-high number of COVID-19 deaths?,"The main factor is that California is highest population state by far. The other factor is that it is quite large and spread out, and frankly hard to enforce much of anything. The political split in California is also pretty extreme, for as far left as a place San Fran is, much of the interior and North of the state is about as Red (Republican) as you can get.

From [Wikipedia ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_(United_States,_1912))

To that end, the platform called for:

Strict limits and disclosure requirements on political campaign contributions
 
Registration of lobbyists
 
Recording and publication of Congressional committee proceedings
 
In the social sphere, the platform called for:

A national health service to include all existing government medical agencies 
 
Social insurance, to provide for the elderly, the unemployed, and the disabled
 
Limiting the ability of judges to order injunctions to limit labor strikes
 
A minimum wage law for women
 
An eight-hour workday
 
A federal securities commission
 
Farm relief
 
Workers' compensation for work-related injuries
 
An inheritance tax
 
The political reforms proposed included:

Women's suffrage
 
Direct election of senators
 
Primary elections for state and federal nominations
 
Easier amending of the United States Constitution
 
The platform also urged states to adopt measures for ""direct democracy"", including:
 

The recall election (citizens may remove an elected official before the end of his term)
The referendum (citizens may decide on a law by popular vote) 
 
The initiative (citizens may propose a law by petition and enact it by popular vote)
 
Judicial recall (when a court declares a law unconstitutional, the citizens may override that ruling by popular vote)"
809,Ask_Politics,"In the US's first century, the two dominant parties were pretty fluid and changed a lot. Why/How did they get cemented as the Democratic and Republican Parties after the Civil War?","This is a good question and you could write an entire research paper. So I'm going to make some pretty broad conclusions that could certainly use more detail, but I just don't have the space.

First of all, starting with the Civil War is interesting because this was such an earth shattering event. Up till now, the parties had largely broken down upon regional lines--the North had industry and what were the ""liberals"" of the time, and the South had farming and what were the ""conservatives"" of the time. Overall the exact parties that represented these two camps were fairly fluid for the first 80 years of the country, but for the most part they turned into Republicans in the North and Southern Democrats in the South.

This fault line was particularly noticeable in the Civil War. Lincoln of course was a Republican, and he literally went to war with the entire southern half of the country, and he won. Unsurprisingly, this did wonders for the Republican party. He was the greatest American hero since Washington himself, and then to make his political legacy even more legendary, he was martyred.

Plus, on the other side of the coin, the South was in disarray. Not only was the Dem party stained with slavery, but also their entire political concept was destroyed. The great battle of agrarian vs. industry had just been settled decisively in favor of industry. States' rights lost utterly. Pretty much everything the South and the Dems had been about since the beginning was shown to be a losing hand.

Also, we were able to learn some lessons from that very fluid first 80 years. Despite all the various contortions the party system went through, the North-South divide remained. So even adding more parties didn't really change the political spectrum at all, but rather just fragmented each side into multiple pieces. There never was a Know-Nothing president, or a Free-Soiler, or a UCP. And when third parties did get large enough to challenge for really mattering, they served more to create confusion and weaken strong candidates than they did anything else--the election of 1828 for example.

So at the end of the Civil War, we had an ascendant, dominant Rep party and a weak, broken Dem party, it's quite apparent that breaking off political parties only served to weaken your allies more than your enemies. So naturally, we entered what was essentially a one party system for the next 60 years.

Looking at this era, the Gilded Age, we see some of the weakest political platforms we've ever seen. There was a dearth of major policy outside of the Pendleton Act, and with the Dems unable to successfully shake their ""party of slavery"" label, there was no real impetus for the Reps to have that kind of leadership. Lincoln's early death left him no time to transfer leadership beyond himself, and Andrew Johnson's ineffectual time in office set the tone for the future of the party.

This is even more stark when you consider that this era also had Teddy Roosevelt, who very much was NOT this mold. Him even becoming president at all was something of an error, as the whole point of making him VP was burying this annoying guy and his IDEAS in a dead end position. Roosevelt shook the party but also divided it--the only reason Wilson and his broken Dems won in 1912 was because Roosevelt split the Reps with his Bull Moose party. But just as in the case of Cleveland, Wilson failed to truly remake the Dems into a nationally viable party and as soon as the outliers were gone, we were back to Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover-style bland Rep candidates.

This era ended with Herbert Hoover when the lack of strong leadership from the Rep party resulted in utter collapse and FDR was able to FINALLY rebrand the Dems. FDR's New Deal built a brand new coalition--still largely based in the South with old Dem voters, but also expanding into poor people of all colors (capturing the black vote for the first time) and northern urban elites tired of a lassez faire system that clearly didn't work. This was the beginning of the shift in the Dems from a conservative, Southern party into the party we know today.

It didn't happen overnight though. FDR's coalition wasn't stable (urban elites and southern conservatives together, and the black vote?) but his leadership and WW2 were enough to hold it together to pass to Truman. Truman continued this core constituency of poorer and minority voters with measures like the Fair Deal and integrating the armed forces. JFK and LBJ kept this going even further with civil rights legislation, continuing to replace southern conservatives with northern liberals. And Nixon accelerated this with his southern strategy while Reagan capped it with the Religious Right (up until then the Dems had relied heavily on certain religious denominations).

One of the constant themes you'll see is a shift from regional identity being essential in the beginning of the story to a gradual shift on policy focus as we move more into the modern era. This makes sense, as America's hyper-obsession with regional political identity was always a bit of an outlier.

Will we see shifts again? Certainly, but probably not to this scale. The US has fluctuated pretty heavily at times between political extremes, and it does seem like we've reached more of an equilibrium point. But there is already some evidence of the Religious Right fracturing as the rise of people like Pete Buttigieg suggest that there still space for certain constituencies to move around. But it's unlikely we'll see the kind of seismic shift again after the Civil War or even from 1933 to now."
810,Ask_Politics,"What is the likelihood of the proposed $2,000 a month bill by Tim Ryan and Ro Khanna being implemented?","The Democrats will be on board, regardless of the price.

The Republicans right now only have one thing blocking them: How Trump feels about it. If the viral loads don't change, or rise in certain areas and physical distancing is needed into May and June, he could get on board as his only real concern is getting reelected and a bad economy or people without a safety net and increasingly blaming him will cause him to give the okay signal to the GOP to support it. Trump's GOP really has no ideology anymore, other than being subservient to Trump."
811,Ask_Politics,The F.C.C. just announced their plan to repeal net neutrality. What can be done about this? Is there anyone who can block this plan?,"Whether ISPs could restrict free speech depends on what exactly you mean by ""free speech"". Freedom of speech, as enshrined in the First Amendment to the US Constitution, is freedom *from government restriction* on speech, and even then, there are still some limits (the classic example being you can't yell ""FIRE"" in a crowded space). With regards to this definition, nothing you say or do on privately owned websites (ie, virtually all websites) counts as protected speech. Since there is no such thing as Constitutionally protected free speech on internet sites, nobody can restrict free speech on them.

Let's consider the broader concept, however, that all fora which are open to the public at large and used in such a manor as to imitate a public forum should not place any restrictions on speech. This is obviously not a legally protected form of free speech, but, IMO, this is the concept most people think of when they think ""freedom of speech"". With regards to this definition, then, yes, the elimination of Net Neutrality could absolutely restrict free speech. It wouldn't be the government restricting it, but ISPs (unless the government were to influence how an ISP managed its internet service).

Say you purchase internet service from Comcast. Comcast also owns NBCUniversal. Comcast also owns Xfinity, which has a mobile streaming service (which rivals Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Video, etc). Say Comcast wants to increase viewership of their 24 hour news channel, MSNBC. They could throttle the speed of every other streaming service which offers news content. They could charge exorbitant fees to any company who wanted to stream any news that is not MSNBC over their service. They could even throttle or charge The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, or any other news service. As a consumer of Comcast cable, all you'll notice is that some services cost a lot more than others, and that some websites take forever to load. As time goes on, Comcast subscribers will gravitate towards Comcast owned content, including MSNBC news.

The same thing will happen with content provided by every single ISP. They could do the same thing with social media platforms, like Facebook or Reddit. Say Comcast purchases some small social networking site. They could throttle or charge all others until their own social media platform is the only viable option for their customers.

This is bad, but mostly is just means that you will be reading the news, watching the TV shows, and engaging on the social media platform that your ISP wants you to. Imagine, however, that 21st Century Fox, the company owned by Rupert Murdoch, and which owns Fox News, acquired an ISP. Or, imagine if George Soros purchased an ISP and a news network. Depending on your political slant, one of those two people being able to control what news people get and what social media platform they engaging in probably scares the heck out of you.

It should. This is exactly what we are looking at with the removal of Net Neutrality protections.

As far as what can be done to prevent it right now? Probably not a whole lot. Presumably, if enough members of Congress were motivated strongly enough they could block it. If your current Senators and Representatives are not strong vocal supporters of Net Neutrality, you can contact them and ask them to try to block the FCC removing the protections.

Beyond that, vote for politicians who support Net Neutrality in every election you can, and convince everyone you know to do the same. Make Net Neutrality a signature issue for yourself and others."
812,Ask_Politics,Who is responsible for paying police to provide security at Trumps political rallies?,"The Secret Service is responsible specifically for protecting Trump himself wherever he goes. They'll do whatever they feel is necessary for that. But if the campaign or local government wants more generalized security for the event they would be responsible for that themselves or follow whatever policies they normally have for event security. The Secret Service should not be responsible for that kind of broader event security since they work for the US government, not Trump's campaign."
813,Ask_Politics,Can the President cancel or postpone an election using Presidential Directive 51?,"No. Elections are administered by the States, not the federal government, and the date of the election has been determined by Congress. The president has no authority to delay elections."
814,Ask_Politics,Thoughts on the Biden platform?,"It seems fine. He wants to put some infrastructure money into some emerging growth industries that are likely to see some major job growth in the future. Coincidentally that's also pretty good for the environment. It's a good plan. I'm sure there are flaws or weaknesses, but it's not like it's an obvious non-starter or glaringly stupid. It's a very middle policy--it will have detractors on either end of the spectrum but overall has something for everyone and it's probably better than what we have now. Solid plan, I guess.

EDIT: Fixed economy to environment."
815,Ask_Politics,Why is there not a peep about the Supreme Court’s ruling on partisan gerrymandering? Why am I only hearing news about their ruling on the “Citizenship question”?,"The event was reported extensively. The ruling was definitive. What’s left to be said about it?

The Citizenship question, on the other hand, has new developments as the President is still trying to fight it."
816,Ask_Politics,"If Trump was impeached by the House, could McConnell never bring a vote on it to the Senate in the way he is currently handling House-passed funding bills?","No, not without a change in the Senate rules. The rules of procedure of the Senate make impeachment trials mandatory. There's also a good argument that for the Senate to deny a trial would abridge the House's ""sole power of impeachment,"" as it would make it impossible for the House to prosecute the impeachment.

817,Ask_Politics,What is the purpose of excluding adult dependents from receiving a Stimulus Bill?,"The recent stimulus bills are an attempt to maintain the country economically while we go through the pandemic. The term “dependents” implies that someone else is responsible for the basic necessities of the dependent. Since dependents don’t entirely provide for themselves, they don’t need assistance, or are at least a lower priority than the person or people claiming them as such. 

The corporate loan programs are similar, but that’s a different discussion with its own variables and arguments."

819,Ask_Politics,"Why wasn't John McCain blocked from attacking Rand Paul with Rule 19, like Elizabeth Warren was against Jeff Sessions?",Legislative rules have no power of law.  They only exist to the extent that a member is willing or forced to comply.  There is no remedy for a legislature ignoring its own laws.  
820,Ask_Politics,What's going on in the Border Camps these days and why is there little coverage?,A lot of the people coming in are no longer being placed in camps. They're just being expelled from the country.
821,Ask_Politics,Is there actual data that backs up the claim that Sanders supporters are disproportionately vitriolic online?,I don't think there can be data on something so subjective.
822,Ask_Politics,What's the most effective way to boycott China?,"Seriously though, reduce consumption of manufactured goods. Buy second hand."
823,Ask_Politics,How can I learn more about politics?,"Here's a simple primer on how to build some critical thinking skills. Please long workday, so apologies for making any assumptions or if this isn't clear. Cool disclaimer out of the way.

1. Read. Start on the Wikipedia pages of things you want to know about. Let the internet show you a path. You need to know where to start and this is often a great leaping off point. But don't trust everything you read!
2. Read some more, this time focus on the other side of whatever issue/topic you were looking into.
3. Think. Just about all you've read.
4. Read more. About the topic generally again, but now with a deeper understanding of both sides of the subject.
5. Ask questions. Of people you know, of groups you are part of, random people on the internet.
6. Listen. It's like reading but with your ears. And I mean it, Listen. Hear what you're being told.
7. Ask questions of what you heard. Is there a subtext beneath the comments? Is there an agenda for the speaker behind their answer? Does what is said mesh with your understanding of the issues? If not, why?
8. Analyse what you've learned. Look at it from all the angles you can. Let yourself be taught by what you've learned about and by what you've learnt about yourself from the process.
9. Self reflect. Is your understanding of the issue biased? Are you being honest?
10. Make your mind up on the issue. Formulate an opinion or understanding based on your research. 
11.  Always be on the look out for fresh data. Your decision can change! It's okay to be wrong, just makes sure you adjust your position using a method similar to the steps above. 

Hope that helps."
824,Ask_Politics,Those who voted for Trump because they couldn't stomach Hillary: what's the worst case scenario if she'd won?,"At the point I'm writing this you're not getting a lot of responses from actual Trump voters.  I'm not one either, but here's my perspective - I think of myself as someone who held my nose and voted for Hillary, and that was mostly because of how repugnant I felt Trump is.

I think with a Republican controlled Congress Hillary would have had a difficult time getting things done like gun control or abortion or whatever.  I think some of the concerns about big issues like that are overblown, personally.  Like Obama, she'd have to lean heavily on executive orders to accomplish things.

I was more uncomfortable with what I thought she would NOT accomplish.  She was clearly far too comfortable with Wall Street and the big banks to really ever do anything about the fundamental economic issues we have.  It disheartened me to think that we could have another financial crisis or recession and, in the end, still be back to the status quo.  At the end of the day I guess I just never believed Hillary had the best interests of the people in her heart on this important topic to me.

Again - not that I think Trump or most other random Republicans would have done better - I am just saying it would have been very easy to peel me away from Hillary if I saw anything remotely better than Trump."
825,Ask_Politics,"In the US, why is health insurance tied to our employer?","In 1942, with so many eligible workers diverted to military service, the nation was facing a severe labor shortage.

Economists feared that businesses would keep raising salaries to compete for workers, and that inflation would spiral out of control as the country came out of the Depression. To prevent this, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9250, establishing the Office of Economic Stabilization.

This froze wages. Businesses were not allowed to raise pay to attract workers.

Businesses were smart, though, and instead they began to use benefits to compete. Specifically, to offer more, and more generous, health care insurance.

Then, in 1943, the Internal Revenue Service decided that employer-based health insurance should be exempt from taxation. This made it cheaper to get health insurance through a job than by other means.

After World War II, Europe was devastated. As countries began to regroup and decide how they might provide health care to their citizens, often government was the only entity capable of doing so, with businesses and economies in ruin. The United States was in a completely different situation. Its economy was booming, and industry was more than happy to provide health care.

This didn’t stop President Truman from considering and promoting a national health care system in 1945. This idea had a fair amount of public support, but business, in the form of the Chamber of Commerce, opposed it. So did the American Hospital Association and American Medical Association. Even many unions did, having spent so much political capital fighting for insurance benefits for their members. Confronted by such opposition from all sides, national health insurance failed — for not the first or last time.

In 1940, about 9 percent of Americans had some form of health insurance. By 1950, more than 50 percent did. By 1960, more than two-thirds did.

TL;DR: Businesses started offering health insurance when wages were frozen during WW2.

826,Ask_Politics,"Why do cops from Hong Kong, Chile, Barcelono etc, fight protestors with such vitriol when they will also stand to lose their sovereignty or rights?","They usually bring in soldiers and police from far away provinces to do the dirty work.  In HK, you have mainlanders oppressing them."
827,Ask_Politics,Just wondering if would be possible for the government to cut their vacation short to vote on a much needed stimulus package?,"The House has already passed another stimulus bill & it’s been sitting on McConnell’s desk for over a month.  He has the authority to call the Senate back to session, but I don’t see him doing it."
828,Ask_Politics,How is virtually every person in my workplace a Trump supporter even though everyone with the exception of upper management is a member of a labor union?,"Beginning with Bill Clinton and his Third Way, Democrats became close to Wall Street and affluent urban professionals who were socially liberal and pretty much abandoned blue collar workers and the rural middle class who were socially conservative.  Democrats no longer focused on strengthening and growing unions, busting up big companies, and taking over industries.  

Obama bailed out Wall Street and the auto industry, Hillary Clinton gave speeches on Wall Street and favored globalization like Obama and Bill Clinton, and the Clinton Foundation accepted millions from foreign sources.  Your fellow workers do not think either party represents their economic interests, so they go with the party that represents their conservative social interests."
829,Ask_Politics,"Would now be a good time for two new parties (say ""Conservatives"" and ""Progressives"" to form?","We directly elect the president, so a two party system is inevitable.  You can't have a coalition government since it's overseen by one person.  So in a multi-party system, the parties would still align in a two coalition race that mirrors what we see today.  In your hypothetical four party systems, the progressives and democrats would support Biden, and the Conservatives and Republicans would support Trump.  Or maybe the progressives would refuse to follow party leadership (but in parliamentary systems party loyalty is a big deal unlike here) and cede the election to Trump, but I doubt it."
830,Ask_Politics,Does Bernie's plan really cancel all private health insurance? And what does that mean for ridiculously expensive treatments?,"There are no ""free"" healthcare countries.  We pay taxes and get healthcare for it.  The same way Americans don't ""pay"" for their military protection."
831,Ask_Politics,"Why do American presidential candidates all run as if the Presidency is an autocrat, and not limited in power by the other branches of government?","Sounds better than, “I’ll do what I can but it really depends on who’s in the senate and house”"
832,Ask_Politics,"Do opponents of gay marriage in the U.S. use any objection other than religion, and if so, what is it?","The biggest non-religious argument I've heard is against a federal ruling, and it should be a states' rights issue. 

The biggest problem I've seen with that is when it's viewed from a state viewpoint, people use the same religious reasoning. "
833,Ask_Politics,Why did Trump wait for Democratic control of the House before pushing for his most controversial proposal?,"Trump doesn't want the wall, he wants the controversy. Actually trying to build the wall would lead to a lot of legal challenges, the land owners on the border would be pissed, the wall would be [ineffective](https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1083370191969501185/photo/1), and the costs would be well over the numbers Trump likes to throw around even before getting into maintenance costs. 

The ""deal"" Trump offered isn't a serious attempt to negotiate. The courts are already blocking him on killing DACA, so a temporary extension is nothing. He's counting on his base not to understand that, and coverage from Trump-approved medai sources means they won't.

It's Trump kicking off his 2020 campaign, nothing more. "
834,Ask_Politics,The president elect is facing 75 lawsuits all filed before his win. Has any previous president elect faced this many lawsuits while transitioning to president?,"I don't have an answer to your question about previous presidents, but I can address this:

>""Is there a legal clause that could prevent the president elect from transitioning to president if he is found guilty?""

No, not in this case. First of all, these are all civil suits and not criminal charges. Second, even if these were criminal charges and he was convicted of every single one, he'd still be able to take office in January. The Constitution has only two requirements to be president (natural-born, and over 35), and the Supreme Court has ruled that no additional requirements can be made."
835,Ask_Politics,"Could I get a ""why not"" on each Democratic candidate? I've watched both (as in all four debates) and I definitely have a top 2, but what are some skeletons in closets people really ought to know when choosing whom to back?","Michael Bennet holds a vulnerable seat if a Democrat were to be elected as president.  If he were to win, he'd have to give up his seat in Colorado, which would be up for reelection in 2022."
836,Ask_Politics,Millennials leans towards Democrats by 27 points. Is age-based partisan lean that strong normal & how much is likely to change as Millennials get older? Are Democrats poised to have a significant advantage as Boomers die over the next several decades because Millennials lean so heavily Democratic?,"Millennials have a very abnormal partisan lean compared to past generations. I personally believe it is because they are the only generation that has been raised in the current hyper-partisan era. Since this is new no one really knows what's going to happen going forward, but we can consider what theories have been developed to explain voting behavior. 


 One of the theories is that the first two election cycles someone participates in will dictate how they vote going forward. So millennials who were turned out by Obama twice will probably vote for Democrats for their whole life. Turnout for Obama and against Trump might  solidify a strong blue base for the Democrats for decades to come. As millennials get older and vote more often Democrats will have a bigger base, which is good if you like Democrats willing more elections. While some people may change later in life, the effects will be marginal. 

From my position Republicans aren't looking too hot 20 years from now. There's not enough leaning red millennials to replace all the aging boomers. This will require that the party changes and adapts, so I think it's likely that the future Republican Party will loosen up on social issues and adopt more Libertarian vibes. After the hard tract to the right started by Reagan, I think conservatism will be in retreat in the near future. Parties are good at adapting, so while there will be a Republican Party 20 years from now, I think it will be less powerful than its current iteration."
837,Ask_Politics,Did any massive ICE Raids lead to prosecution of the plant executives?,"https://apnews.com/e7113c50a6fd4d2688fc2f2b8a9a91cd

> A key hurdle that predates the Trump administration is that federal law makes it a crime to “knowingly” hire workers who are in the U.S. illegally.
> “The ‘knowingly’ term has proved to be a huge defense for employers,” said Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute. “The employer says, ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t know they were unauthorized.’”"
838,Ask_Politics,"According to CNN, Trump is the first president to use a party committee's money to pay legal bills for a federal investigation. The legality of this seems not to be fully agreed upon. What are the potential implications and consequences?",Do doctors get free malpractice insurance from hospitals they work at? I thought they had to pay for it themselves. I like how taxpayers pay him a salary and for his vacations and for upgrading all his many homes with security. The RNC pays all his legal bills. All his publicity is free on Twitter. What does he actually pay for??? I thought being rich was having money to pay for anything you want; I guess it means making others support you. How any libertarian can support him is beyond me.
839,Ask_Politics,Why didn't Susan Rice decide to enter the U.S. Senate race in Maine to unseat Senator Collins?,"Among some of the issues that other replies have discussed (possibly high unfavorables, the right having perpetually vilified her, Gideon potentially winning the invisible primary), weak ties to Maine. She isn't even from Maine: it's just where her family's summer home is. And if there's one thing Maine hates when it comes to politics, it's outsiders. To put it simply, somebody who can easily be marked as a 'DC insider' with no 'real' ties to Maine wouldn't have been the best choice."
840,Ask_Politics,Why does Biden historically do so well with African Americans?,"Most African-Americans are moderates not progressives. Especially the older generation, who are more likely to go out and vote."
841,Ask_Politics,Where are the competing strongmen in U.S. politics?,"I wouldn't expect Trump to do very poorly against a competing strongman because in the democratic party that archetype does not enjoy much success. Conservative voters like politicians who criticize the nanny state and political correctness. Conservative voters like politicians who reaffirm their beliefs and parrot what they hear from Limbaugh and Hannity. 

The outcome in 2020 will better explain what happened in 2016. Did Trump win 2016 because they liked his messaging or did he win because the voters hated Clinton? 

There is a lot of projection among people who identify as being progressive and every once in awhile they're reminded that the democratic party, as a whole, is a center-right party. 

Trump managed to monopolize the strongman persona because his social conservatism appealed to the tea party Republicans and since he wasn't a politician, a lot of people gave him a pass. Sure, primaries can get really heated and dirty but the 2016 GOP primary was unprecedented."
842,Ask_Politics,Why do Presidents typically change their Secretary of State multiple times while in office?,"Cabinet positions generally rotate, and its really rare for one person to stay in one cabinet position.  Foreign policy also tends to be an issue that can cause massive divisions and rifts within within a cabinet, and you'll find a lot of names on the list (Powell, Haig, Tellerson, Vance) who sorta fell out of favor do to some massive eternal strife."
843,Ask_Politics,"If a state fails to certify its electors, is the “whole number of Electors appointed” reduced, as referenced in the 12th amendment?","Yes. If a state just doesn't certify *any* slate, then they're sitting out the election. This has actually happened before: 1864 & 1868. As you point out, the Constitution provides that the winner must secure a majority of the appointed electors, so even if a state just chose to not appoint any electors, the Electoral College as a whole would still proceed with or without them, with the winner simply being the candidate who secures a majority of appointed electors. So if it happened today, the number of electoral votes up for grabs would be rendered less than 538, in turn meaning the number required to win would then be less than 270. The only way it goes to Congress is if there's a perfect tie, (be it 269-269 out of 538, or some other numbers out of a number less than 538), or if a 3rd candidate makes it so that nobody secures a majority of the appointed electors (be there 538 or some lesser number)."
844,Ask_Politics,Why is the GOP in the U.S. against marijuana legalization?,"The line that the LEOs give to politicians is that cannabis legalization would ""negatively affect our ability to conduct investigations into serious crime."" (Republicans, and many Democrats, are happy to parrot this line.)

That's their way of sugarcoating the fact that they use ""a police officer smelled marijuana"" to get around Fourth Amendment protections on a routine, everyday basis, and that they've done it for so long, they don't even know how to conduct investigations without lying about smelling cannabis.

It's their totally subjective, un-disprovable way of getting around the Constitution and the fact is, it *would* impede their ability to conduct investigations as they currently do them if cannabis was legalized.  But they should never have wielded the power like this in the first place."
845,Ask_Politics,Is the US Senate confirmation vote for the SCOTUS seat a 50+1 vote? Or a simple majority?,"Just a simple majority. Kavanaugh's vote was 50-48, which means about 51% of the votes were in his favor and he was confirmed."
846,Ask_Politics,Is there precedent for disparate news outlets to report separate election result? Could it happen in the US?,"News outlets could try.

Famously, in 1948, the Chicago Tribune reported that Dewey defeated Truman in the election.

But the results of each state are submitted by the state government to Congress. So each state certifies their results. You just need to tabulate all 50 states, plus DC and the territories, and there you go. Election results.

No amount of reporting can argue an election is actually closer than it is when the states certify the election results, and publish them."
847,Ask_Politics,"How do Sanders and others expect to expunge marijuana records when the vast majority of people in prison for marijuana are charged with state crimes, which the President cannot pardon?","While he can't directly expunge records, those records will quite possibly be expunged as a response to the federal laws. An analogous situation is crimes relating to homosexuality. In Queensland, Australia, people with historical homosexual convictions can apply to have those records expunged courtesy of separate pieces of legislation which came about in response to the federal decriminalization/legalization of homosexuality. 

In general, legalization of a certain act/behaviour that has come to be viewed as morally acceptable is generally accompanied by a push to remove the disadvantages faced by people convicted for that act."
848,Ask_Politics,Where would the US founding fathers fall on a political compass?,"It depends on whether we're grading on a curve. I'd argue that one should always judge political views based on context - i.e. time and place - otherwise it doesn't make any sense. You judge a person's ideology relative to their contemporaries.

If you judge them based on the politics of the time they were off the charts far left. They violently rebelled against the crown and gave the common people more rights than they had ever held before. However, if you impose today's world view on them they were far, far right. All of them at least tolerated slavery (some even owned slaves themselves). All of them were against women's suffrage. Etc."
849,Ask_Politics,What are the modern day criticisms levied against President Reagan?,"For those on the right, he not only increased the size of government (spending, civilian employment, you name it), increased deficits astronomically ($79B in 1979 the year before he became president, $155B his last year; debt increased by $1.86T during his presidency), he changed his mind and policies (frequently, and often move further left \[i.e., increasing taxes, negotiating an arms agreement with Russia\]),  he was soft on abortion, and he forced states into changing their drinking age (states rights anyone?).

He escalated the war on drugs (including the money wasting ""Just say no"" campaign and ramping up mandatory sentencing).  His tax policies began, and have served as the model, for the income inequality we see now (his attacks on organized labor also accelerated the wealth gap).  He made anti-government beliefs mainstream, including the idea that government is to blame for things, and that government is something outside of us (it's not; we are government).  He lied about people on welfare to convince Americans that most people getting government assistance didn't ""deserve"" it.  His environmental policies were terrible.

We got al Qaeda thanks, in large part, to Reagan's policies in Afghanistan, and Pakistan got nuclear weapons thanks to his administration, too.

His support of ""perception management"" to label anyone that reported on things that made his administration look bad as ""anti-American"" paved the way for Fox News and all the other right wing media outlets that are focused more on making those on the right look good than report news (and, of course, our current president's knack for saying any reporting he doesn't like is ""fake news"").  This also led to the idea of ""political correctness"", a way of blaming those that point out when people use derogatory language as being the ones that were doing something wrong.

His response to HIV was a national disgrace (it's true he turned it around, a bit, later, but the first few years, absolutely terrible)

The Iran-Contra debacle should have resulted in him being removed from office for violating US law, violating his oath of office, and other high crimes.

Those opposed to immigration would also criticize him for being weak on immigration.

There's so, so much more.  He was, truly, one of the worst presidents we ever had; certainly worse than his successor.

850,Ask_Politics,Why is Bernie doing worse than he did in 2016?,"[This comment has been deleted, along with its account, due to Reddit's API pricing policy.] -- mass edited with https://redact.dev/"
851,Ask_Politics,What was the deal with the $1.5T?,"To give a super simplified TLDR, the Fed loaned banks cash, which the banks paid back with treasury bonds. Banks need cash so that the day to day economy works. If banks collectively run out of cash, that's a major financial crisis

A longer explanation:

1. There are different kinds of money that banks have. Some of it is liquid - it can be moved around at will. When you go to an ATM, the money you withdraw is liquid. Some of it is not liquid - think of something like a house. The bank owns the house, that house has value, but you can't withdraw .01% of a house from an ATM. You can only withdraw that house's value from the ATM once it has been sold. That house is part of the bank's assets, but it can't be used anytime soon. Let's call liquid money cash from now on

2. The government requires banks to have a certain percentage of their assets as cash, so that when consumers use their debit card or ATM, the bank can give consumers and businesses that cash. If a bank is short of cash, it goes and borrows cash from another bank that has enough 

3. But what if other banks are also short of cash? That's what happened yesterday. Banks were short on cash because of coronavirus and the economic downturn. But unlike normal, this affected a lot of banks, and there wasn't enough cash to go around. This is called a liquidity crisis - everybody needs cash, but banks' money is tied up in stuff that can't become cash soon (think of that house I mentioned in #1)

4. In comes the Fed. They announced that they had a pool of $1.5 trillion dollars of cash that banks could access. If a bank wanted cash, they had to give the Fed the same amount in US Treasury bonds in return (very safe investments, but ones that take years to become liquid). When things settled down, the banks could then give the Fed that cash back, with interest, and get their treasury bonds back

This had nothing to do with the stock market, it's about preventing a financial crisis and all the very bad things that come with that (things like runs on banks, where consumers and companies scramble to get *their* money out of a bank while there's still stuff in there). Stocks went up briefly because preventing a liquidity crisis is good news, but that good news didn't overshadow all the other bad news, so the stock market kept going down"
852,Ask_Politics,"Why isn't giving cops body cameras seen as ""tough on crime"" and opposing body cameras seen as ""soft on crime""?","Because ""tough on crime"" is code for ""unconditionally supports police"". It's a slogan, not a policy."
853,Ask_Politics,What are the arguments for and against the US bombing of Laos?,"[https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/laotians-killed-50-years-bombing-campaign-181121000620903.html](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/laotians-killed-50-years-bombing-campaign-181121000620903.html)

I don't know if those numbers you gave are accurate, but the US government admits to dropping 2 million tonnes of bombs from late 1968-1974, and it is estimated that there are still 80 million unexploded bombs in Laos.

The US's justification for the extensive bombing was to cut off supply lines for North Vietnam and to prevent China from providing further assistance to North Vietnam. It was kept a secret because the government knew it would be a PR disaster to admit to bombing the daylights out of a non-communist nation with whom we were not at war. Ironically, our bombing campaign in Laos may have destabilized the nation enough that the communists were triumphant in the civil war which ended in 1975, and the new government was heavily reliant on support from the USSR."
854,Ask_Politics,What are the NATO Treaty Ramifications if Turkey attacks Greece? EU if Turkey Attacks Cyprus?,"Like most things, “It depends”. 

Technically NATO obligations don’t kick in unless the member invokes the [Article 5](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm).  So if Turkey attacks Greece and they don’t invoke the Article, no one has an obligation to come to the defense of Greece. 

It’s get confusing because what if Turkey argues that *Greece* is actually the aggressor and they are actually defending themselves?

It could even get more confusing because if Greece doesn’t, but retaliates, what happens if Turkey does invoke it?

Likely NATO will instead try to force them to the table for negotiations since it would be conflict between two of its members.  But what actually happens is largely a guess."
855,Ask_Politics,"In the event of an electoral college tie, where the vice presidency must be determined by the Senate - can the sitting Vice President break a 50-50 tie?",">If the Senate is equally divided, can the incumbent Vice President
cast the deciding vote in a Senate election of a Vice President? The
answer should be affirmative, because Article I, Section 3, clause 4 of
the Constitution appears to admit of no exceptions. However, Lawrence D. Longley and Neal R. Pierce argue that the plain meaning of
the Twelfth Amendment’s language, “a majority of the whole number
[of Senators] shall be necessary to a choice,” precludes the possibility
of the Vice President breaking a tie.

856,Ask_Politics,Why is Joe Biden on top of the polls ?,"Biden is basically the ""beer track"" (vs ""wine track"") part of the pattern that frequently occurs in Democratic primaries: https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-09-11/usc-latimes-poll-democrats-ideology-2020-presidential-race

> The Biden-Warren matchup, which many Democratic insiders think could be the final bracket of the primary contest, has begun to resemble a familiar pattern.

> Democratic primaries have often featured an insurgent with strong backing from white, college-educated voters challenging an establishment-backed candidate with significant blue-collar and African American backing: Gary Hart versus Walter Mondale in 1984 and Paul Tsongas against Bill Clinton in 1992 are two examples of such “wine track” versus “beer track” races.

> While this year’s contest differs from those in many ways, it has one big similarity: Warren, like the “wine track” candidates of previous years, needs to find a way to broaden her support, especially among African American and Latino Democrats.

> Warren tied Biden with white college graduates at 23%, and was also essentially tied with him among the most liberal quarter of Democratic voters.

> But her support fell to 9% among whites who did not graduate from college, 6% among nongraduates of all races, 3% among all African Americans and 7% among all Latinos, the poll found."
857,Ask_Politics,Do Democrats have a significant advantage this election due to mail-in voting?,"Yea, probably.  The question is, will the ballots be delivered, accepted, and counted. 

[Politico has an article up today](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/10/democrats-early-voting-lead-412106) showing that Democrats have a **three to one advantage** over Republicans in absentee ballot requests in NC and PA.  700,000 more Democrats than Republicans have requested absentee ballots in FL.  

That's hinting at turnout too.  175,000 PA Democrats who *didn't* vote in 2016 have requested ballots for 2020.  

Given that Trump won PA by 44,000 votes last year, those 175,000 PA requests seem pretty important.  Still though, a ballot out isn't a ballot in."
858,Ask_Politics,"If a city defunded or disbanded their police department, wouldn't all law enforcement just fall to the County Sheriff?","Defunding or disbanding a police department doesn't mean there are no cops whatsoever. In the case of defunding, it's actually a lot less extreme than it might sound. Basically, instead of providing funds so that the cops are involved in literally everything, you'll instead spend money on preventing crime or getting more qualified professionals involved. For example, for mental health calls you'll have more mental health professionals involved and less cops. Or instead of spending money providing overtime for cops to bust kids in parks, give that money to the parks and rec department to create programs that keep kids busy. Defunding police means to reallocate spending to places that will reduce the need for cops, allowing them to focus on what their job should be: dealing with crime, particularly violent crime.

Disbanding the police also isn't nearly as apocalyptic as it sounds. In fact, Camden, NJ did it back in 2013. Many of the same cops were rehired, and the police force actually increased in size, and most NJ residents would agree that Camden in a better place from a safety and crime perspective than it was several years ago. In the short term, yes, you'd see more emphasis on other police-type forces besides the MPD (county, state, sheriff, etc), but overall disbanding the police force is very unlikely to result in a long period of time where Minneapolis does not have police."
859,Ask_Politics,How does the CDC have authority over U.S. housing policy?,"The way our government is designed, limitations aren't spelled out as much as authorities.  It is only when somebody sues that we truly determine it is legal or not.  As it stands, the Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to issue broad orders in the interest of public safety. Anyone could sue them and take it to the Supreme Court where it would be set in stone...or not, based on the constitutionality of the order and the authorities spelled out in the HHS/CDC charters, as well as the constitutionality of the authority granted.  A state could also sue the federal government and automatically get it to the Supreme Court."

861,Ask_Politics,What are some things the Trump administration SHOULD have done to better prepare the US for COVID-19?,"Trump was told in January that covid-19 had the potential to be a serious problem. And stopping travel from China was a good first step. But here are some steps that could have been taken:

1. Screening of airplane passengers from China with flu-like symptoms starting ASAP from January 30. Trump's travel ban did not apply to American residents retiring from China


2. Beginning to stockpile PPE in preparation for a possible pandemic. Also, contracting companies to ramp up supplies of PPE


3. Screening of passengers from Italy in March, after the covid-19 outbreak there. 


4. Task FEMA with organizing and running a coordinated covid-19 response across the nation. Instead of 50 states scrambling and competing with each other for supplies, FEMA could control a stockpile and send equipment out where it's needed 


5. In January Trump could have created a task force to prepare for a pandemic, with scientists and experts. 


As an aside, [here's an article about Trump's dismantling of the pandemic preparedness structure he inherited from President Obama](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/05/trump-obama-coronavirus-pandemic-response)"
862,Ask_Politics,Were the polls really that far off in 2016?,"Not at all.

There is a significant difference between polls and projections/analysis.

Polls are a tool used to show you the preferences of voters *at the time the poll is conducted*. Nothing more. They do not predict results. They do no tell you who will win the election. They tell you ""if the election were run today"" what the results would be. Polls take a lot of time and effort to do, and most reputable polls are done by well known polling outlets with a long track record,

Projections/analysis is an attempt to use the data provided by polls to predict the future. People doing projections usually use the data provided by others (polling firms) and make their own guesses off this data. This can be something as rigorous as the 538 polling forecasts you cited. These rigorous analyses will usually come with a margin of probability. They don't say, ""Clinton will win"". They say ""there is a 65% chance that Clinton will win the election."" Or, analysis can be as basic as somebody looking at a poll and saying ""I predict the winner of this poll will win the election"".

In 2016 specifically, as you noted, the *polls* were very accurate when compared to the results of the election. The *analysis* was kind of all over the place, though. Some (like 538) were pretty accurate. They predicted Clinton would win, but her probability was rather low (60s%, which means the prediction is wrong 2 out of 5 times). Many pundits on major cable news channels, however, did very poor analysis (basically just saying, ""the winner of this poll will win the election"") and ascribed arbitrary probabilities to it which were not the result of statistical analysis. That's where you get people saying things like ""Clinton has a 99% chance to win.""

A good rule of thumb when listening to polls is if they try to *predict the results* dig deeper into how they got that prediction. If they simply say, ""this is the state of the race right now"" then you can assume they are just reporting the results of the poll."
863,Ask_Politics,"Why does the Bloomberg campaign think it can sway moderate/independent (and even Republican) voters when Bloomberg is a much much more extreme ""gun taker"" than any other candidate?","Because that's not as much as an issue as reddit makes it out to be. [Gun control has grown increasingly popular across the political spectrum.](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/20/771278167/poll-number-of-americans-who-favor-stricter-gun-laws-continues-to-grow) When you look at suburban voters, Romney-Clinton voters and moderate Republicans, advocating gun control can be a point in a politician's favor.

The people who are single issue voters on gun control are either voting Trump or were never Bloomberg's target audience to begin with."
864,Ask_Politics,Why are so many Republican Congressmen quiet about this whole whistleblower scandal?,"If this Impeachment thing ends up going poorly for Pelosi’s side then supporting it could be political suicide for a Republican. There’s not much to gain right now out of throwing one’s support behind it. 

If impeachment becomes popular Republicans who personally dislike Trump may become more inclined to back impeachment and paint themselves as a profile in courage, but there’s no real benefit to stepping forward early. I mean obviously there’s the moral benefit, but c’mon, it’s politics."
865,Ask_Politics,The guy in New York on the news who Cuomo got his bill reduced had a $620k bill for an emergency spinal fusion. Why are hospitals able to charge the uninsured two or three (ten?) times what insurance companies pay for the same procedure?,"Imagine you are a hospital. You know when you set your prices, insurance companies are going to demand a discount. Since the vast majority of your money comes from them, you have no choice but to enter into this negotiation, and you do so with virtually no bargaining power - except the initial cost that will get negotiated down. Since everyone has to be presented with that same initial cost, the uninsured gets the non-discounted rate.

This isn't the headline story because everyone knows how this works."
866,Ask_Politics,What's stopping democratic candidates from sitting together on a public podcast/stream and talking about issues? Why can't they debate independently?,"The DNC doesn't allow people to participate in third party debates if they want to be in DNC debates.  And before everyone screams ""evil DNC,"" this actually makes sense.  If third party debates were allowed, every group out there wold hold a ""debate"" and attack any candidates that don't show up.  It would elevate the fringe candidates even more than the 20 person debate mess we just had.  

Heck, you'd even have strategic ""debates"" so that group could push an agenda.  ""Elizabeth Warren didn't show up to the climate change debate, so she's not a real progressive,"" ignoring the fact that the ""debate"" was sponsored by a dark money group founded by BP.  Stuff like that."
867,Ask_Politics,Will President Trump putting a hiring freeze on federal government jobs affect my chances of getting a job with the National Park Service?,Yes. I believe it's temporary but for right now this means you cannot get that job. 
868,Ask_Politics,Why did Donald Trump ridicule Mitt Romney for releasing his tax returns later than expected when he himself has no idea when he'll be able to release his tax returns?,You literally just described Trump's entire campaign. There are countless amount of examples where he says/does completely conflicting things.
869,Ask_Politics,Did the world see the Arab Spring or the collapse of the USSR coming?,"This is a complicated question. When we talk about ""the world"" who are we really talking about? Did Joe the Plumber expect the USSR to collapse or the Arab Spring? Most definitely not. Did some academics see the signs and point out these regimes were far more fragile than we suspected? Of course. Mubarak, the ruler of Egypt at the time, sure seemed surprised by the speed and ferocity of the Arab Spring. That's the other thing. Just because you can predict unrest/revolution/a new political movement doesn't mean you can predict how effective it will be. Even if you did see the Arab Spring coming, I highly doubt you expected it to tear through so many regimes so quickly. And I highly doubt you predicted WHICH ones were most affected accurately.

In short, predicting the future is a dangerous game. Anyone who's reasonably educated in certain areas can do it generally speaking pretty well, but the details are what are most important and they're what are most elusive. Lots of experts are right about 90% of what they predict but that 10% is what most matters, and that's what they got wrong.

But your point is well taken--the US is showing signs of hollowing and even though it looks like we're at the apex, maybe we're not. And yes, this does happen quite a bit. The USSR's collapse was somewhat unexpected. Everyone knew the arms race was stretching them quite thin, and there was expectation that something was going to have to give at some point, but the complete and total collapse of the system so suddenly was not thought of as one of the likelier outcomes. For the Arab Spring, this was genuinely a more surprising event at all. I think a lot of folks were expecting some of the more dictatorial regimes in the region to struggle as the internet and social media continued to connect together the population, but no one quite expected the kind of democratic outpouring that we saw, and toppling Mubarak with relative ease was a real shock.

And it's not just with these events either. We've seen it time and time again where you don't realize you're at the apex until you're already past it. Look at the NRA. A year ago, the NRA looked stronger than it had EVER been. Then Mueller exposes Marina Butina, and now they have a lawsuit, and even before then they were REALLY struggling with membership fees, and now the organization as a whole looks weaker than it has been in forever. The Religious Right looked completely unassailable when even Donald Trump couldn't shake loose any voters based on moral reasons...but the last few months we've seen some cracks in the dam even though Trump's core base is still the Religious Right. There are plenty of examples.

So to get directly to your question, yes, there are some folks who are very concerned that, ironically, making America great again IS actually a top concern. In addition to the areas you highlighted, we've seen the US greatly undermine its own alliances with NATO and the rest of the world to the point where now the entire rest of the world placed a travel ban ON US. Even just 4 years ago, the rest of the world putting us in time out is beyond ridiculous. Many of the fundamental things that allowed the US to rise to the prominence of a superpower aren't happening any more and there's enough failure happening right now in enough sectors of our society that we should be concerned.

It's hard to say definitively ""yes, we are collapsing"" because of all the future-predicting challenges I discussed above. But looking at what is happening and these factors that are present in our society, if they keep happening, would you call that being a successful state? This doesn't even cover the issues of health care and other troubling economic metrics. This is one reason why politics has gotten increasingly apocalyptic--there are actual, real, major issues we are facing in society and some folks are trying to pretend the just don't exist or are scapegoating others. This isn't just about being nice to strangers. For lots of folks it's about improving the rot in our system or letting it fester.

One VERY important note: collapse isn't what it used to be. We live in a historical era where even natural and necessary change to the political order is resisted quite heavily, which kinda limits how far a collapse can go. It's thought that only 2 nukes were ever detonated on the world, but you could argue the first one was actually the collapse of Rome. The entire foundation of most of the world was shaken when Rome stopped being the dominant force it had been. The collapse of regimes used to be much more complete and create a much stronger power vacuum than you tend to see today. For example, the USSR was FAR larger than any other political entity that had similarly collapsed. But most of those countries, only 30 years later, are doing OK, and Russia as a geopolitical foe is actually more successful now than they were in the USSR days. Mubarak fell...but Egypt still struggles some of the same corruption and governmental challenged that they did before the spring. So a ""collapse"" of the US may be less of a collapse and more of a demotion. I highly doubt that even if you're completely right we'll see the US cease to exist as we know it, but I do expect we will lose our ability to influence world events like we used to and we may not be hands down the richest country in the world with the best standard of living."
870,Ask_Politics,"The Federal Election Committee has not had enough members for quorum since 2017, how will this affect the 2020 elections?","The FEC regulates campaign finance in federal elections.  Without a quorum it can't issue fines or new regulations.

871,Ask_Politics,The Latest Poll from the Trump Campaign: is it that bad?,"It's pretty typical of what they (and a number of other people at times) do.

Trump removed Mr. Fine as IG of DoD and designated an Acting IG for the DoD (Sean O'Donnell, IG of the Environmental Protection Agency to take on DoD as well) and nominated Jason Abend as replacement IG for DoD. Mr. Abend will need to be confirmed by the Senate to take over.

This effectively removed Mr. Fine from the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee because committee members must be IGs. Mr. Fine was selected as chairman by the members of the committee.

We switched to 100% vote by mail in 2011 and it is super convenient to vote. You can mail your ballot through the Post Office or do what I do and go to one of the MANY drop boxes around the state. I drop my ballot through the slot and check online after the election to verify that my ballot was counted. Going to a physical location and waiting in a line to go into a booth and vote seems absolutely archaic and I would never want to go back.

882,Ask_Politics,Why is the left so opposed to voter ID laws?,"For example in Italy you must bring your national I'd card when you vote.

But, everyone by law must always have one, so it doesn't make it harder to vote since you'll have it anyway. It costs less than 10€. You get it at small county offices that are very granularly distributed over Italy. And it allows you to travel to all EU countries without need for a passport.

No politician would ever think to make getting ID cards hard to avoid people voting. It's just unthinkable. 

In the US there is no similar ID card and there's a history of making it harder for people to vote. The implementation would be fraught with issues and risk discouraging voters."

885,Ask_Politics,"What evidence supports or refutes the claim that the influence and strength of the United States, both political and cultural, are declining?","At work so I can't do much research but I remembered this article from 2017 - [Sharp Drop in World Views of US, UK: Global Poll](https://globescan.com/sharp-drop-in-world-views-of-us-uk-global-poll/). I'm skeptical of polls in general (sample size isn't too much either, only 18k) but the result is quite striking - the global opinion of the USA dropped sharply and is now one of the least well-perceived countries in that list, below even China and barely above Russia.

Additionally, the number of international students studying in the USA has been s[tagnating in absolute numbers](https://p.widencdn.net/5i0s78/OD19_graphics_handout-2019) since 2015/16 (but rising strongly before that) while global numbers of international students are actually increasing (i.e. the USA is getting a smaller share of students). The numbers are not disastrous but a big contrast with the huge increase before (very roughly from about 9% average YoY growth to now average -3%).

Of course there are a lot of factors at play there but in my experience, enrolment statistics are a pretty good indicator of student and parent perception of education value, safety and the country in general. That's aside from the economic, research and political benefits of getting the talented students over (in fact world leaders disproportionally studied abroad, I've heard numbers up to 45%)."
886,Ask_Politics,Why do liberals not attack Obama for perpetuating Bush's foreign policy?,"Many liberals do. Noted blogger Glenn Greenwald, for one.

887,Ask_Politics,What considerations are necessary before a president is able to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act? How will the management of the situation be different if the act is invoked?,"To answer your first question, the President can invoke the act during a time of civil disorder, insurrection, or rebellion. The President is also required to have a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse. I don't know what kind of oversight exists to prevent a President from overstepping. I assume Congress or the courts can try to stop him though the normal ways they can. In the context of today, the riots and looting is a danger to public safety and property. Since the government is obligated to protect both, bringing in the military would be a tool the Federal government has if the State fails at this task.

To answer your second question not many believe its necessary. President Trump believes the only way to look good is to take a hard stance against the looting instead of a sympathetic stance with the protesters. None of the Governors want him to invoke the act.

The difference if he invokes the command is that he can have the National Guard answer to him, and he can order them to act harsher. He can also send in the Army who, being a full time service may have better training."

891,Ask_Politics,How can the United States become united as a people again?,"I think it depends on what you mean by ""united.""  


Does united mean ""We all have the same opinion?""  


Or does it mean ""We may have DIFFERENT opinions, but we can come together on a course of action that is best for the nation?""  


My sense is that this feeling of divide is more because stuff just isn't getting done.  It's the same damn arguments again and again.  


The fix, to me, is simple.  Get Congress back to work.  Over the years, we've let them slough off their legislative responsibility.  Nobody holds their congressperson accountable - we are lazy, it's far easier to blame the one guy, the president, that we see where opinions of him are presented to us on a silver platter by the media.  The Executive Order scope creep we have been seeing since before Clinton is because of this.  The presidents haven't been actively TAKING power, Congress has been slowly abdicating it and they have been picking it up.  


Because of this, we the citizens, no longer run the country with our votes.  Congress has become content to sit on the sidelines and just blow the dog whistles to keep us voting predictably which secures their jobs.  


We SAY we want a democracy, but we ACT like we want a king.  


The fix is:  
1) Repeal all the crap laws where we can no longer trace where our Congressmen are getting their money.  
2) Full disclosure on any proposed bill written by a lobbying organization so we know WHY it is being written.  
3) Some form of ranked choice voting so that IF a new political party develops by the will of the people, it has a fighting chance.  
4) Last one is the toughest - the public needs to change it's mindset.  We focus our attention 90% on the president, 10% on our congressmen.  That needs to flip.  Our voice is through the House and to a lesser extent the Senate."

* The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment.

* The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern.

* The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff.

* The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded.

* The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship.

* The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship."

899,Ask_Politics,How does the National Guard work? What powers does the President have over the National Guard vs. the states? How is it funded?,"Guardsmen can fall into two categories: title 32 (national guard activities) or title 10 (military activities) 

So if activated by the president, they'd be on title 10 orders. This includes things like overseas deployments. Active duty troops are always on title 10 orders 

If activated by the state government, they're on title 32 orders. This is anytime the governor uses them to respond to riots, natural disasters, etc

>Its my understanding that states have a degree of control, but how much?

The president has the power to ""federalize"" the guard. Meaning put them in title 10 status. The state government doesn't have to consent. Example: when Eisenhower used the Arkansas guard to enforce desegregation in Little Rock. 

Unless guardsmen are in title 10 status, the state governor has control. 

>Who pays the bills?

The simplified version is ""whoever is giving the orders."" There are some exceptions, like if part of a state is declared a federal disaster area, the federal government will pay the bill for any troops operating in that area, while the state government still has a degree of control. Aside from edge cases like that, if the president says jump, you get paid by the DoD, if the governor says jump, you're getting paid by the state.

Interesting fact: states usually pay way less than the DoD. While on title 10 orders, guardsmen get paid based on active duty pay charts, including things like bonuses and housing allowance. If you're on title 32 orders, you get paid by the state which is usually pennies on the dollar compared to active pay.

>The president is the commander and chief, does that mean he has complete authority over the National Guard?

900,Ask_Politics,Did Trump really claim the coronavirus was a hoax or is this a media misinterpretation?,"""This is their new hoax."" He said it. He meant that the Dems were making it out to be a bigger deal than it was, which we would later find out was *dead* wrong. He didn't call it a hoax in the sense that he denied it existed like someone calling the moon landing a hoax. I would say tomayto/tomahto personally. What difference does it make if the he didn't act accordingly because he didn't believe it existed or because he didn't believe it was a big deal despite the evidence to the contrary? We're still in this shitbucket because of his actions. That's my take at least."
901,Ask_Politics,How does a “vote by mail” provisional system in the midst of this crisis have an affect that favors one party over another?,"As an over-generalization, high turnout is bad for Republicans (or at least, this is the conventional wisdom in Washington). That's why almost in every case, the Dems are pursuing policies that make voting easier while Republicans are pursuing policies that make voting harder. Vote by mail makes it easier to vote, which will likely hurt GOP candidates, so they are against it.   


In this specific case, I suspect their worry is that it will be hard to go back once vote by mail is implemented, since voters will see it is considerably more convenient. There's also the worry that's part of a lot of the GOP response to COVID that people tend to stick with the sitting President when things are good, and are more likely to vote him out when things are bad, and disruption to the normal routines of public life makes people feel like things are bad. Trump is clearly acutely aware of this, a lot of his motivation over the past five months has been to act like everything is fine and great and nothing needs to change."

905,Ask_Politics,Why is Russia trying to interfere with American elections?,"Putin is backing the two most polarizing candidates for a reason.  He feels that sowing discord and weakening the country internally is a powerful attack. Turning their attention inward instead of toward the real danger.  Putin does this in other countries too.  It is partially to weaken other countries, countries he sees as competitors.   It is also internal.  In Russia, the people are often jealous of our freedoms, prosperity, real voting rights, etc.   Russian state TV shows how elections are all messed up and don't matter.  When you have a leader who intends to stay in power in a country that doesn't have what we have, how do you show your country why you should stay in power?  By showing how dysfunctional we are.

908,Ask_Politics,Is Congress essentially toothless having a GOP Senate majority?,"Congress has the theoretical power to do anything really, provided there is a majority.

The House could even, in theory, *arrest* Barr via the Sergeant at Arms for not testifying.

But in practical terms, neither side will do anything *extreme* because of political risk and the *fear* that the other side will do the same.

So Congress is really toothless, like you surmise. The closest analogy to me is that both Republicans and Democrats in Congress are like the US and USSR during the cold war . . . constant bitching, threats, blockades, but never any real action and absolutely never any *direct* action against each other.

This is why there is a 0% chance of Trump being removed from office before 2020."
909,Ask_Politics,ELI5: How can Trump change the laws so radically through executive orders when Obama couldn't seem to make the kind of progress he wanted to?,"Presidents do not change laws, but they sometimes get to choose how, when and which laws the President's departments enforce. They may get to choose because Congress gave them the right to choose, or because Congress wasn't clear about what, how or when as the law was written. Sometimes the President thinks he has authority he doesn't really have.

Now that you understand the difference between an Executive Order and a law, consider what ""radical"" means. Lincoln ending slavery was radical. Roosevelt's New Deal was radical. Johnson's Great Society was radical. Obama's universal healthcare was radical. These policies were grand departures from the Nation's history, they required huge sums of money and acts of Congress, and they defined each President's legacy.

By this standard Trump hasn't done anything radical yet. Congress hasn't repealed Obamacare. The wall has not been built. Tax reform hasn't happened yet. Trump's Presidency feels radical nonetheless because of his use of populist rhetoric, simple language and hyperbole to communicate. His communications style is radical as compared to past Presidents. His style conveys progress that hasn't actually happened... yet.

If its true that Obama didn't make the progress he wanted it can be blamed on the inability of the President and Congress to work together. The reasons for that are too long to explain.

Trump may not have this problem because his party controls both Congress and the Presidency.



"
910,Ask_Politics,"Why is Yemen considered a failed state while Qatar, Bahrain and UAE are among the richest countries in the world?","Quite frankly, it's the abundance of natural resources, sectarianism, and international support.

Bahrain isn't all that great either, but I'll get to that in a second.

To understand all of this, you have to understand first the map, and second the geography. First, the [Persian Gulf](https://notwhatyoumightthink.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/gulf-states.gif). What you should note:

1) Of the states shown in the picture, there are 6 joined in a political and economic union (meant to someday be similar to the European Union according to some, and be security-based too). This is called the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and it includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Bahrain. Of them, some are richer and some are poorer. Some are more populous and some less. Yemen is not in the GCC, but was close to when all the turmoil in Yemen began.

2) These GCC states cooperate openly and hugely to ensure that they all remain stable. For example, when the financial crisis hit world markets, Abu Dhabi had to bail out Dubai (both Emirates in the UAE) [to the tune of $20 billion](http://www.arabianmoney.net/banking-finance/2014/03/16/abu-dhabi-extends-20bn-dubai-bailout-loan-by-five-years-and-cuts-interest-rate-to-1/). This has not stopped within country borders: in 2011 when the Arab Spring started, the Gulf went on high alert, fearful that it would sweep their rather stable sheikhdoms as many predicted it would. So when protesters began the Pearl Revolution in Bahrain, and hundreds of thousands took to the streets, they huddled closer together and sent the Peninsula Shield Force ([filled with Saudi and UAE troops](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2013/01/saudi-arabia-gcc-announcement.html)) to quell the protests. It should be noted that the Peninsula Shield Force was established to stop *outside* attacks, not meant to put down revolts or rebellions or protests.

To explain why these networks played out how they did, you have to understand first the oil reserves and riches of each country, and then the network each country is built on.

**Saudi Arabia** - According to the Energy Information Administration, Saudi Arabia [has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, at 16%](http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=sa). That's right, nearly 1/5 of the world's oil can be found in lil ol' Saudi Arabia. They have a population of less than 30 million, allowing them to provide their citizens with great public sector jobs that make the country essentially full of public sector and family-based workers/businesses, without any planning for the future (attempts to do so have failed so far, but may work later). Saudi Arabia has squirreled away a nest egg estimated at [$750 billion](http://www.ibtimes.com/saudi-arabia-feeling-pain-oil-price-plunge-it-has-enough-currency-reserve-last-years-1767238). This would be enough to fund the government for at least 2 years *without selling a drop of oil*. Even with lower oil prices, Saudi Arabia can weather for decades without a serious cut to domestic spending, using reserves. They have larger (possibly more than double) the reserves of Russia with a population less than 1/4 its size, to put that in perspective. Additionally, because their population is mostly Sunni, they have been able to blame any unrest and unhappiness on the Shi'a population and say they are colluding with Iran (unlikely), while paying off their citizens to keep them compliant. Whether or not this will continue to work is up in the air with increasing access to the rest of the world on the horizon and a succession crisis looming, but it's worked so far.

**Kuwait** - One of the other rich Gulf States, Kuwait is a bit of an interesting case. They have a quasi-democracy, with institutions for democracy but the institutions mostly being a farce for it. The control is still vested, of course, in the Emir. They have a small population of less than 4 million, [and have the 6th largest proven oil reserves in the world](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=ku). These have proven a huge boon here as well. While their population is more diverse, with a 60-70% Sunni population and the rest Shi'a, they have largely managed to avoid sectarian tensions. They're more willing to compromise and act, and money always helps.

**Qatar** - Possibly the best off in terms of the Gulf States, Qatar is both hugely Sunni (as Saudi Arabia) and very small in population, while very high in riches. Their population is around 2 million, and they have very few problems: they emerged almost entirely unscathed in terms of open protest from the Arab Spring. Some chalk that up to their freedom for using Al Jazeera to report on news elsewhere while dealing with possible dissidents by promising to house them as long as they cause trouble for *other* regimes (i.e. Muslim Brotherhood). They're also extraordinarily rich and influential on the world stage, guaranteed protection by the largest U.S. airbase in the Gulf (Al Udeid), and they served as mediators in the past in Yemen, Lebanon, and Sudan, while maintaining ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, and various other political Islam groups (groups that have Islamic values but seek to push them into politics). Qatar is in the [top 20](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=qa) for proven oil reserves and has tons of natural gas as well, making it a pretty prominent economic player.

**United Arab Emirates** - This one is a bit of a stranger case, because of the way the Emirates system works. Some of the regions are poorer than others. At any rate, the UAE has [one of the largest proven oil reserves in the world as well](http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=TC), and a population of less than 10 million. Inside that population is once more some significant homogeneity, helping them avoid sectarian tensions: over 80% are Sunni rather than Shi'a Muslims, and they have diversified their income to become a financial hub in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, as well as a lucrative investment region.

**Oman** - This one is even weirder than the rest. Led by Qaboos bin Said al Said, one of the most beloved rulers of Oman (and who has been in power since the early 1970s), the country has mostly weathered storms and economic troubles if they ever arose. They have a population of less than 4 million, and [though their reserves aren't as high as the rest](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=mu), they've kept them mostly stable. Oman is close to a potential succession crisis, as their leader has been [ill for quite some time, possibly terminally](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/10/oman-sultan-qaboos-future-health-iran-saudi-gcc.html), and he has not designated a successor. If a successor is not agreed upon by the family within 3 days, they're supposed to open a letter that will determine his choice. However, the potential for lying, forgery, a loss of faith, and upheaval over his choice is very large, and Oman's dwindling oil reserves could prove a potential problem in the future. Luckily they have avoided sectarian tensions: they are run by a rare sect of Islam, Ibadi Muslims, making the country a bit unique on the typical ""Sunni-Shi'a"" axis we think about.

**Bahrain** - This is the biggest hotbed of trouble for the Gulf, and bears the most resemblance to Yemen (as I'll explain later). Bahrain is a population of less than 2 million, but its oil reserves are also dwindling like Oman's. [Most estimates put them at running out in 20 years tops](http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=ba), and they are incredibly troubled. The main reason is because the running of the country by a small royal family has been put in stark relief thanks to religion. The religion of the royal family is Sunni Islam, whereas most of the country (up to 70%) is Shi'a. The exploitation and unfair treatment of these Shi'a has often inspired them to rise up, and they typically join with other Sunni Muslims, though keeping them divided and keeping the Sunni afraid of the Shi'a has long been the goal of the royal family. They required bailouts and military assistance to put down the Pearl Revolution, and they are still precariously perched on the brink of possible civil war.

Now we come to Yemen. When we look at the factors that determined the stability of the above countries, we narrow it down to a few:

1) Oil: Can the country pay its citizens off? The question here is overwhelmingly no. [They have poor oil reserves](http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=ym) and their production has declined since 2001. Their citizens are poor, and [they have a worse water crisis than most](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139596/adam-heffez/how-yemen-chewed-itself-dry). Yemen is a poor economic wasteland at this point.

2) Sectarian Tensions: How does the country see itself? In the south is a hotbed of Al Qaeda affiliates, fighting for the Sunni cause. In the north came the Shiite Houthis, with reported Iranian support. The previous leader, who had kept it all together very tenuously with tribal alliances, was removed in the wake of the Arab Spring. The population is basically evenly split between Sunni and Shi'a, and sectarian tensions are and have been high.

3) International Support: Can they get help? While the Sunni states around, particularly Saudi Arabia, were able to help the previous regime, they gave up a long time ago. Iran helps the Houthis, Al Qaeda continues in the south, and Saudi Arabia lost [influence there awhile ago](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/08/gulf-crisis-saudi-arabia-influence-fade-yemen.html). So they don't get help, and the central government basically fell apart as a result.

That should give you a nice understanding of the basic dynamic. Sorry it's so long!

Thus, they choose to go for the Amendment route, which was difficult but also nearly irreversible. That is, until the 21st Amendment came around.

After the Great Depression, specifically after Jones & Laughlin (1937), the SCOTUS began to give Congress more power regarding interstate commerce. Over time, the regulation of illicit substances, such as marijuana, have been deemed a constitutional exercise of Congressional power.

I would argue that since these districts are supposed to be representative of the people living in them, that breaking up the city as you did would actually run counter to that goal. City people and rural people have different interests and priorities and should probably be represented accordingly. I suggest taking a look at [FiveThirtyEight's Gerrymandering Project](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-gerrymandering-project). It might change your mind on some things or provide some new info.

Obama's only leverage is the possibility of a Democratic president and Senate in 2017.  If that happens in November, the Republicans might scramble to affirm his nominee before they lose any input at all after the new President and Senators take office, especially if the following scenario takes place:  

Clinton is currently trying to portray herself as Obama's staunchest ally, and Sanders is trying to chip away at her lead among black Democrats.

(For birth on or after November 14, 1986, a period of five years physical presence, two after the age of fourteen, is required. For birth between December 24, 1952 and November 13, 1986, a period of ten years, **five after the age of fourteen**, is required for physical presence in the United States or one of its outlying possessions to transmit U.S. citizenship to the child.) The U.S. citizen parent must be the genetic or the gestational parent and the legal parent of the child under local law at the time and place of the child’s birth to transmit U.S. citizenship.

It's no coincidence that since his father died, half of Kim Jong Un's generals have gone MIA, and there were reports of a possible coup around when he first took over. 

While I doubt he's just a figurehead now it's certainly possible. Far more likely is that even after purges his position is still somewhat flimsy. He's making the decisions but knows that he's loosing his grip on the country. That's where all the bluster and rhetoric is coming from.

China is not a good comparison as this is yet another way they are flexing their authoritarianism.

Of course, the actual bill the governor was talking about does not make infanticide legal, and nobody actually supports that, so Trump is mostly just making stuff up.  Though it's not just Trump.

924,Ask_Politics,Why aren't US presidential primary elections held on the same date?,"> I've noticed when a candidate wins an ""early state"" they go up in the polls, and people often vote for them more in the later states. Shouldn't the primaries be held on the same date to avoid voter peer pressure?

No, exactly the opposite. It's *absurdly* expensive to run an effective campaign across the entire country. Ads, field offices, and the like all cost money. Staggering the primary means that the campaigns can spread out this spending and can use election results in earlier states to boost their name recognition. 

This is also why the first two states are both fairly small. It's much cheaper to run a campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire than in, say, California. A candidate who does well in those states can expect a raised profile (making future campaigning easier) and more contributions (making future campaigning affordable). While ""candidate was popular in Iowa"" isn't necessarily the best criteria to get a name out, it's certainly better than ""candidate had millions of dollars in their campaign treasury before a single vote was cast.""


For the general election, the party infrastructure can provide the organization, experience, and resources to run an effective campaign. For primaries, candidates are on their own."

We recently had a man with a knife in my town trying to stab people after being told to leave an establishment. He came after people and police officers while threatening their lives with the knife (actually making contact with one officer and the knife) and an officer managed to detain the man without shooting him (used a taser) and protect the community around him.

They only make a fuss about those things when it comes to using it as an excuse for any policies democrats want to get passed."
927,Ask_Politics,Would Medicare for All lower the quality of healthcare in the US?,"Sure, for some people.  

US healthcare may *very well* be the best in the world **IF** you can afford it.  I hear the [Bugatti Chiron](https://www.bugatti.com/chiron/) may very well be the best car in the world too, though the basic model costs [a cool $3,000,000](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/05/success/bugatti-la-voiture-noire/index.html)... which is coincidentally [what a transplant for an infant](https://twitter.com/cnbc/status/1076337283148611586) can cost.  

It's extremely hard to quantify what ""good"" healthcare means.  For me, a father of three, ""good"" healthcare means that my kids can get in front of someone who can tell me if they're in serious danger and when they can go back to school.  

For my parents, when I was being treated for Leukemia, ""good"" healthcare required considerably more resources.  

For a billionaire with a heart condition, ""good"" healthcare may mean a hospital that's willing to move heaven and earth so he can land on the helipad, schedule a world renowned specialist on short notice, do the procedures around the client's schedule regardless of emergencies that might hit the door, and handle a private recuperation to avoid a media spotlight.  

And it's completely fair to say that all three of those are equally valid definitions of high quality healthcare.

So while Medicare for All will probably lower the quality of healthcare for some Americans, the question isn't really ""will Medicare for all reduce the quality of US healthcare at all"" but rather ""will Medicare  for all reduce the quality of US healthcare for the vast majority of Americans?""

And honestly, probably not.

Because healthcare is not **actually** accessible for the vast majority  of Americans.  

[63% of American families can't raise $500 if they have an emergency](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/01/06/63-of-americans-dont-have-enough-savings-to-cover-a-500-emergency/#4069bc684e0d)... but the average American family has a family deductible of [just under $8,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/23/heres-how-much-the-average-american-spends-on-health-care.html).  That means they have to shell out ~$8,000 cash before their health insurance starts picking up the lions share of the costs.

But if you don't *have* $8,000 then, really quickly, you have to start making decisions about your finances rather than your health.  And if that's happening, it really doesn't matter if you have the best or the worst healthcare in the world because, if you can't afford it, you don't actually have it.

The American healthcare system is like a Bugatti Chiron -- it may well be the best in the world, but it's only the best in the world for the small handful that can really afford it.  For the rest of us, it just looks pretty from the outside."

If you also want to get into politics as an informed citizen I would recommend making sure you understand how government works, who has what roles and how those roles came to be in addition to just knowing policy positions. 

I would also urge you to use primary sources, read directly from reports/official documents and not summaries or opinions about them. Consider who is writing that primary source too. Remember there is no such thing as something without bias. "
931,Ask_Politics,"Now that we have a split congress, what are the things that the House can do without and Senate, and what are the things the Senate can do without the House?","House of Representatives:

* The House alone can bring articles of impeachment (charges of bribery, treason, or other high crimes and misdemeanors, which result in removal from office if convicted) against federal officials, but the trial and verdict is in the Senate, so the House cannot unilaterally remove officials. The House chooses the prosecution team for the trial. The accused chooses their own defense team.

* All bills for raising revenue (tax bills) must originate in the House.

* The Speaker of the House is 2nd in the presidential line of succession, after the Vice President.

* If no person receives an absolute majority of electoral votes for President, the House chooses the president from among the top three electoral vote getters. But in doing so, each state gets one vote, and the delegation from each state votes to determine their state's vote. An absolute majority (26/50) is required for the selection.

Senate:

* All federal officials other than Congress, the President, and Vice President, are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate. So all executive officers and judges, etc, must be approved by a simple majority vote of the Senate. However, Congress can put the appointments of officials other than the Cabinet and the Supreme Court in the hands of the president alone, Cabinet members, or courts, and they have done so for many lower-level officials.

* All treaties must be ratified by a vote of 2/3 of the Senate.

* Acts as jury for impeachment. A vote of 2/3 is necessary to convict.  All those convicted are removed from office, and the Senate can additionally bar them from ever holding any federal office again. The removed person is still subject to criminal and civil prosecution.

* If no person receives an absolute majority of electoral votes for Vice President, the Senate chooses the vice president from among the top two electoral vote getters. An absolute majority is required for the selection."
932,Ask_Politics,"What IS the ""alt-right"" anymore?","The term ""alt-right"" was originally created by white nationalist Richard Spencer and referred to his specific ideology, but has been used (and misused) much more broadly since then. 

In a nutshell, some of the main differences between the alt-right and the traditional right are that the alt-right emphasizes virtually no nonwhite immigration while the traditional right allows for some degree of controlled immigration from abroad, the alt-right is very isolationist (think: anti-Israel) while the traditional right allows for more military intervention and participation in foreign affairs, the alt-right supports protectionism in trade while the traditional right usually does not, and the alt-right supports an ethnically segregated society focused around the family while traditional conservatives are largely individualistic. 

While these views don't necessarily make someone a part of the ""alt-right"", they are all inherent to that ideology. While I wouldn't label Trump as alt-right, it's pretty clear why he appealed so much to that group considering some of his policies. Overall it's a pretty fringe group but does have a large presence in places like 4chan. 

To answer the last part of your question, it's a pretty specific ideology but the term has lately been used more as an insult to refer to those who lean heavily right than the actual, ideological ""alt-right""."

935,Ask_Politics,"What is so significant about the Mueller testimony, what are they trying to find out that by now they haven't?","The vast majority of the American public hasn't read the report and the media doesn't seemed to have been willing to provide the public any sort of determination as to what the report means, even though a cursory reading shows it to be pretty damming for Trump. The entire point of his testimony today is for them to have a public, non-editorialized forum to highlight some of the most crucial portions of the report in a way that the american people are willing to watch."
936,Ask_Politics,Is Mueller's assertion that Trump is not innocent normal?,"It's not normal; this is a highly abnormal situation.

It's complicated here; the problem here isn't that they can't prove guilt, but that Justice department guidelines prohibit indicting a sitting president (also, other guidelines say that you're not supposed to say people are guilty if you're not indicting them).  As such, the Mueller report couldn't say Trump should be indicted, because the guidelines prohibit that, nor could it say he's guilty, because he's not indicting.  However, the Mueller report did find enough evidence that, if it were a normal case, Trump would have been indicted (as per the statement of \~1000 former federal prosecutors that said it meets those standards).

Trump, and many who support him, misrepresented the findings of the Mueller report to say they showed Trump was innocent, when they did not do so.  Mueller is speaking up to try to correct that misinformation.

The actual findings of the Mueller report show plenty of guilt; but Mueller doesn't want to be the one to actually say ""he's guilty"", because he thinks it's Congresses or a Court's job to make that judgment in an impeachment case."

938,Ask_Politics,How accurate were Bernie Sanders' claims in his video announcing his 2020 Presidential run?,"My overall assessment: he's exaggerating but broadly correct.   


Healthcare: 30 million is accurate. This is hard to compare, because different countries have different systems. But the USA has significantly more people who experience cost barriers to access than many nations: [https://international.commonwealthfund.org/stats/experienced\_access\_barrier/](https://international.commonwealthfund.org/stats/experienced_access_barrier/)  


Life expectancy has fallen for three years in a row. The biggest factor is drug deaths.   


Starvation Wages: I don't know what this means either. But about 15 million households in the USA experience food insecurity, which means they aren't able to afford enough food to consistently maintain a nutritionally adequate diet. Perhaps ""hungry and malnourished wages"" would be more accurate.   


Child Poverty: the USA child poverty rate is above average for the OECD (the 36 countries that engage in the most trade, which is a reasonable definition of ""major""). In particular, that's higher than all of Northern Europe. I think a more accurate statement would be ""the USA has the highest rate of childhood poverty among economically and culturally similar countries""   


[https://www.oecd.org/els/CO\_2\_2\_Child\_Poverty.pdf](https://www.oecd.org/els/CO_2_2_Child_Poverty.pdf)

&#x200B;

Federal income taxes: This statement is accurate, but there's plenty to disagree about what it means. The biggest case here is Amazon, which actually got a small rebate in 2018 (by small, I mean $128 million). Their defense would be that corporate income for any single year is a not a good indicator of how well a company is doing. In 2014, for example, Amazon made very little income but paid significant tax, such that it's tax rate was a whopping 90%. That's because Amazon was sinking a lot of money into growing non-profitable business areas with a view to future profit. So you'd want a much broader measure than ""some years, some corporations pay 0"" for an accurate view of if corporations are paying their fair share. 

  
More meaningful is the average effective corporate tax rate economy-wide, which is about 16%. That's lower than Japan, a little lower than the UK, a little higher than Germany and about twice Canada's.   


Support for policy is always very dependent on question wording. But I think it is accurate to say that broadly the American public supports far more progressive policies than Washington passes.

939,Ask_Politics,Why is no one talking about uncapping the House of Representatives?,"I would assume to prevent them from simply adding more and more Representatives until it got out of hand. 

Every state gets one Rep, minimum and the rest are shared out with regards to the cap.

If you start trying to make Representatives actually represent an equal number of people with regards to the states then you have issues.

If you have a representative being equal to ~580K people, the population of Wyoming, how many reps should Rhode Island get, population of ~1,060,000?

Unless you start to allow districts to cross state lines you will never get a satisfactorily proportional representation.

And after a quick Google and wiki search, apparently the reasons to cap the representatives was almost purely because the House Chamber had run out of seating space.

The (???) act which passed in 1929 set the current limit at 435 and set the distribution of seats to the decennial census, instead of relying on an act of Congress to redistribute the house every few years. "
940,Ask_Politics,"When Trump voters/supporters say, ""political correctness is hurting this country,"" what do they mean?","Political correctness is a red herring. They are referring to the idea that as a group, we may choose to do what may be the ""wrong"" decision ultimately because we are afraid to address the actual issue at hand and consequently upset people. But that is being really generous. In reality it is nothing more than a manifestation of the conservative right's persecution complex. They genuinely believe they cannot speak freely without persecution.

A conservative might say, for example, that he is not permitted to voice his concerns over trans people being allowed to use the bathroom of their choosing because of ""political correctness"". In reality, although such a statement may draw criticism, no one is trying to silence this person. Additionally, he may then claim that allowing trans people to use whichever gendered bathroom they wish is a form of political correctness. In essence he is saying that society/the government feels compelled to give trans people what they want solely out of a fear of upsetting them if they do not comply. This is at best, inaccurate and at worst completely fictitious as it completely fails to account for the complexity of the issue. Such as the fact that trans people just want to feel safe when they pee. The conservative man in our story is unknowingly using ""political correctness"" as a tool to paint himself as a victim in a situation where he simply wants to curtail the rights of a group of people he finds abbhorent.

Furthermore, the type of people that employ the ""political correctness"" argument are largely emblematic of the concept itself. For example, take that football player that kneeled during the national anthem. His actions outraged millions of conservatives. You might even say he was not acting ""politically correct"" and therefore angered millions. Not only is political correctness a manifestation of the right's persecution complex that they wield like a cudgel, but it is also a double standard.

941,Ask_Politics,Why are Americans so against national health care? Do they not believe access to healthcare is a human right?,"Historically a large majority of Americans have favoured some kind of universal healthcare. This took a dip during Obama's presidency, but the latest Gallus poll still has 51% in favour of federally funded universal healthcare.

I won't pretend to have an in depth knowledge of why it' never happened, but two things to consider. 

1) Those who are against it are *really* against it. This is for ideological, political and financial reasons.  But we've seen that over the past 8 years the Republicans have made repealing the Affordable Care Act (which didn't even provide universal healthcare) their primary policy. This makes it very hard to get anything meaningful done. 

2) Those who do want it can't agree on what it should look like. Thus for example we saw Sanders calling for a single payer system (eg. the UK) and Clinton strongly opposing it while supporting an insurance based system (eg. ACA). Again this makes it hard to progress."

Or is he simply the victim of an increase in media coverage/publicity due to the internet’s growth?,"Joe Biden is *not* a poor public speaker, *especially* for someone who had a stutter in his youth. He is definitely more gaffe-prone and perhaps less cautious over his words than he should be. He can get hot under the collar and sometimes flubs his words; that being said, Biden has a unique factor that combines charisma and empathy in a way that's far more effective than many other politicians. For example, [look at Biden's answer to a deeply personal and tricky question about faith and politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81bzoO9Qy9A). It was once said that the best speakers weave their personal stories into the greater American story, and Biden often connects his message with a deep passion and empathy which is sometimes overshadowed by an inability to connect his words smoothly. How that translates over the television is another story, which is why many may not consider him to be a competent public speaker."
946,Ask_Politics,If Kim Jon Un dies what happens to NK?,"This is the million dollar question. He probably doesn't have an heir--he was young and presumably healthy and had had somewhat recent challenges to his absolute power. Succession was the last thing on anyone's mind (except the guys he killed that were apparently a threat to his power). This is absolutely the worst possible time for this to happen in North Korea because there was almost no concept that this situation would happen any time soon.

So here's where we stand. His sister is probably the favorite to take over because she already is probably the second most powerful person in North Korea. But her being a woman complicates that, and it's very likely that there would be many people who would challenge that. We could see anything from a quick consolidation of power from her to a complete power vacuum that lead to the collapse of the system and destabilization of the area. We just really don't know what is going to happen."
947,Ask_Politics,"Could Russia see a time of political liberalization after Putin either dies of leaves office, perhaps similar to Taiwan or Spain?","Yep it's plausible. 

Chances are stacked against it. But as you've pointed out countries like Taiwan and South Korea, which were treated with the assumption that they'd always be military dictatorships, have liberalized. The key factor with each of them, though, would be the economic growth and industrialization that spurred on social and political change. After Putin, it's not clear Russia would have the same push factor towards greater liberalization. A cursory glance at United Russia would show that it isn't nearly as cohesive and well-institutionalized as Putin's rule itself, which means United Russia could fracture or splinter (there are already other political parties in Russia, mostly relegated to local offices with no real power due to blatant corruption and electioneering). But then again, it might not, and might actually crack down harder in the absence of a strong central figure for fear of total upheaval. There's no real telling. But if the question is simply 'Could liberalization happen?', then yes, it *could*. Whether it *will* is more unlikely but the probability is always there. "
948,Ask_Politics,Why is the Green New Deal/Bernie Sanders against Nuclear Energy?,"I'm not sure about the stances of AOC / the Green New Deal / Sanders, etc. on nuclear. But more generally, an argument against nuclear is that [it's incredibly expensive to build](https://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-power/cost-nuclear-power) a power plant, on the order of billions of dollars. The energy can be very cheap and have low carbon emissions once the plant is up and running, but actually building a new plant requires huge up-front investment. Investing those billions of dollars in a solar farm, wind turbines, etc. would pay itself back faster.

Another argument is that if a nuclear plant breaks down, e.g. from a natural disaster like the [2011 tsunami in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster), you have nuclear waste that is a huge public health hazard. This is a risk even for systems built for safety: in the 2011 tsunami, for example, the reactors turned off like they were supposed to, but the tsunami disabled the emergency generators to cool the reactors, causing them to melt down anyway. Once there's been a leak, [servicing the problem is expensive](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/science/japan-fukushima-nuclear-meltdown-fuel.html) because you'll need to do it with robots.

All of this said, there are plenty of solid arguments *for* nuclear power. But the two reasons above are probably the main arguments against it."
949,Ask_Politics,"IS anyone running for President, who wants to get rid of Citizens United ?","Pretty much every Democrat running has either explicitly stated (Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg, Harris), or implied that they oppose it. It's a pretty uncontroversial part of the Democratic platform at this point. The problem is that since Citizens United was decided based on the Constitution (as opposed to statute law) it can only be overturned by a Constitutional Amendment or a new Supreme Court ruling. Both are VERY hard to get done, and probably can't be done withing a single President's term, and definitely need a lot more than just a President who opposes Citizen's United."
950,Ask_Politics,What exactly IS socialism?,"Socialism is a economic system where the means of production is controlled mainly by the public. Capitalism is the polar opposite where the means of production is controlled or owned privately. That's it. It's that simple. 

Many people confuse ""welfare capitalism"" with socialism. Especially in the U.S...... Welfare capitalism is a system where there are strong safety nets but private ownership remains. 


Example: High Taxes with high redistribution is welfare capitalism.


Example #2: Nationalizing banks, nationalizing natural resources, government run businesses without private competition.... ect... are forms of socialism. "
951,Ask_Politics,Why don’t politicians pass short and concise bills one at a time to avoid giving people excuses to vote against it?,"Are you talking about riders?  Riders are provisions added to bills on purpose.    It's a political trick used to sneak some legislation through or sometimes to intentionally kill a bill.  Often these are provisions that would not be able to be passed on their own merits, so they are packaged with other provisions on a bill that will likely pass.  Sometimes they are meant to torpedo a bill that would otherwise be passed.

I think most people realize that riders suck.  Line-item vetoing is one attempt to get around the rider problem.  I wish they would just do away with this entirely, like through line-item voting on all bills.

952,Ask_Politics,"The GOP repealed Obamacare something like 80 times under Obama, and each time he vetoed it.

They could make grand political gestures to garner votes with almost no political risk.

Now, however, if that bill were to reach the President's desk, Trump would sign it and it would go into effect (eventually, depending on what version they pass.  One of them has a two-year delay).  This means that suddenly there's a political risk that they'll face if the repeal's effects turn sour."

People look out for their own interests.
954,Ask_Politics,Is it actually possible to just sit at home all day and collect welfare?,"""Welfare"" is a broad term, and people often use it as a catch-all when it really shouldn't be. There are many different types of government assistance, and they are all very different in function, purpose, length of time, and eligibility.

Generally however, when people think of welfare, they are thinking of a program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Recipients of TANF can only collect for two years without working. If a recipient has not found work after two years (30 hours/week for single parents and 35-55 hours/week for double parent families), the benefits stop. Also, there is a lifetime limit of five years, so even if you are working, you can only collect benefits for a maximum of five years in your whole life (even if those years are split up--the clock doesn't restart). 

As far as I know, the states cannot loosen these requirements, but they can tighten them, and many do. Many states also have requirements that they have to prove they have been looking for jobs and have participated in job programs. Some require the recipients to have worked for a certain amount of time over a number of years to qualify. 

The rules for other benefits are similar. A person can collect unemployment, but only if they have worked in the past and only if they stopped working through no fault of their own, and most states have a limit of about 26 weeks for how long you can collect benefits. 

For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps), able-bodied adults without dependents can only collect for three months in a 36 month period if they are not working at least 20 hours or attending some kind of job training.

So, in short, no. A person cannot, generally, sit at home all day and do nothing and collect welfare. They may be able to do it for a very, very short amount of time, but certainly not forever. The only exceptions to this are the elderly and the disabled, who receive Social Security benefits for which there is no time limit."
955,Ask_Politics,"What makes the Pentagon Papers okay, but Assange's actions not?","> The Supreme Court ruled that the Pentagon Papers were justified under the First Amendment sixty years ago.

No, they ruled that the government could not get *prior restraint* against the Times. Prior restraint means there's a court order against a defendant banning them from saying something on pain of contempt, and that is heavily disfavored in US law. The Court specifically did *not* rule on whether publication could be punished after the fact. The majority opinion was pretty much just ""there is a high burden for prior restraint and the government hasn't met it, so the injunction is denied.""* Some of the concurrences explicitly distinguish criminal punishment after publication (which might be allowed) with a court order against publication (which isn't).

*NYT v. US* has established a *norm* that the press shouldn't be prosecuted for publishing classified information (and we've seen how much the Trump administration cares about norms), but it did not actually decide the issue one way or the other. All it was about was whether the government could prevent the papers from publishing in the first place, not whether the government could punish them afterwards if their actions violated the law.

956,Ask_Politics,"What does socialism, as in ""Worker ownership of the means of production,"" actually mean?","In the history of the socialist discourse you’ll find a number of very different opinions of what exactly that means.

One major interpretation is to view ownership on the level of a whole class. So the goal is to transition ownership from the capitalists to ‘the working class’ as a whole. This is the more traditional view, and underlies things like the Soviet approach. Here you have a government that nationalizes effectively all industry and manages it all ‘publicly’. The communist party claims its legitimacy as authentically ‘representing the working class’ and as such the governments ownership of the means of the production *is* the workers owning the means of production, albeit pretty indirectly..


Another view, associated with so called ‘market socialism’ is the idea that all firms in the economy *must* be workers co-ops. So each company is kind of like its own little democracy. You can still absolutely have organizational hierarchy, what counts is that it’s voluntary and internally democratic. 

I think both constitute forms of socialism, despite being radically different. The problem is that the word socialism has been used by so many people to mean so many different things it’s not a super useful term in itself"
957,Ask_Politics,How much of a liability will the socialist label be if Bernie Sanders makes it to the general election?,"I've had many conversations with family and friends who are Republicans that do not want to vote for Trump again.

Now obviously if you ignore inflation, people should almost always do better than their parents. When you factor inflation in, yes, the standard of living and how a lot of people measure success (education, savings, debt load, home ownership, etc) appears that for many, they are worse off than their parents. Its still somewhat unclear if it will be a majority or not.

966,Ask_Politics,Bloomberg is given a 10% chance of being the democratic nominee. How is this possible?,"I think it was Politico or maybe realclearpolitics that had an article on Bloomberg's path to nomination. 

Bloomberg's chances depend on two assumptions.

1) Democratic voters aren't as liberal as they might seem and a substantial amount don't want policies like M4A or student loan forgiveness.

2) A substantial number of primary voters aren't happy with their current choices.

If both are true, Bloomberg sees an opportunity to win Super Tuesday by investing all his time and money in those races and ignoring Iowa and New Hampshire. Voters who see Biden as weak, Buttigieg as inexperienced and Warren and Sanders as too radical flock to Bloomberg and he becomes the frontrunner.

However there's not a lot of evidence behind this path. Assumption 1 that many Democrats aren't on board with progressive policy has some truth to it. M4A doesn't poll well, Biden has remained the frontrunner and Buttigieg has recently eaten into some of Warren's support and looks promising to take Iowa. However, I haven't seen much evidence that Democrats dislike the current selection. All the frontrunners from Biden to Warren hold high approval ratings among Democratic voters and you see enough crossover between support for Biden and Bernie to suggest that voters aren't really prioritizing ideological lanes in this race.

So I think 10% is way too high."

968,Ask_Politics,How much of the Camp-Situation on the Border was the same under Obama?,"Snopes and factcheck.org have pretty good summaries, which is where I’ve double checked my info I previously gathered from reading newspapers (mainly Washington Post and NYT). 

With that caveat, my understanding is that the “cages” or chain linked fence in converted warehouses were built under Obama, who faced a large influx of immigrants fleeing violence in South America. However these were designed as temporary 72 hour processing facilities before individuals were transferred to the care of HHS. The big change Trump did implemented was to criminally prosecute any person entering the country illegally (this was rarely done under bush or Obama).

When you criminally prosecute an adult for any crime, they are put in jail and separated from their children. This is where Trumps family separation comes from. The HHS commented in January that since 2016 they saw the amount of separated children rise from 0.3 percent of their total caseload to 3.6 percent, an 11 times increase (a reported 2,730 kids though there are likely a little more). Illegal immigration has also gone up on the whole overburdening the entire system which results in more crowded faculties with less staff and worse conditions. 

I believe several new facilities have been built under Trump in Clint and El Paso though I am not sure and would love if someone knew."
969,Ask_Politics,"Comey gets the blame for Clinton's downfall right before the election, but wasn't the memo private to Congress, and Chaffetz released it to the press?","People criticize Comey because the House Oversight Committee is supposed to monitor the government for the American public, and if Comey sent a letter to them, that letter would almost certainly go public."
970,Ask_Politics,What’s the difference between AuthRight and AuthLeft societies and how would these governments work?,"Okay very basic answer here as I'm sure it won't necessarily please or be sufficient enough for everyone: 

AuthRight and AuthLeft have different goals but similar means to achieving those goals: authoritarianism. The difference in the goals comes down to the difference between right-politics and left-politics.

Right wing politics tend to favor ""order"" and find hierarchies to be natural. They are reactionary, and are skeptical of radical change and of the idea of 'equality' being the natural state of things. Thus, the massive power of the state would be to uphold order and to keep these hierarchies in place. Nowadays, we associate right-wing as 'conservative' but more extreme far-right authoritarian politics could also be described as fascist, corporatist, or monarchist. These are strongly hierarchal societies where 'might is right'. The Authoritarian state is there to uphold the social fabric they see as 'natural', and typically this goes hand in hand with strongman leaders, chauvinism, patriarchy, and nationalism. 

Left wing politics tend to favor ""progress"" over ""order"", and instead look to egalitarianism (equality) as the true ideal of society, with hierarchies being unnatural and a tool of the elites to maintain their power. They (at least in the beginning) favor rhetoric of 'revolution' and radical change as they are skeptical of upholding the old order and the status quo that the Right Wing favors. So AuthLeft governments seek to achieve this ideal of progress and egalitarianism with the power of the state to enforce and maintain it. Authoritarian Left politics manifests itself as Communism (more specifically the Stalinist, Maoist, and North Korean Juche varieties).

You can contrast this with LibLeft and LibRight politics, which are the same yet reversed: LibLeft sees the state as the instrument of inequality and hierarchies, and looks for libertarian ideals in order to achieve equality as they see THAT as the natural state of humans. LibRight on the other hand, sees the opposite - the state and big government as equalizing forces, which they want to minimize in order to let the natural hierarchies develop, which they see as true liberty and the correct society (where the smartest and most able would be allowed to rise/stay at top). They both favor a form of anarchism, except LibRight is anarchism that allows the mechanisms of capitalism to run unfettered and no government getting in the way, and LibLeft is more of the primitivist-hippie sort of anarchy where we'd all be equal and peachy if there were no government and elites. It's comical how the four quadrants of politics can agree on some things but have entirely different ways of going about it, whether it's agreeing on means or ends.

To recap: AuthLeft and AuthRight both only agree on the MEANS to achieve their ends: total power for the state. Fascism and Communsm are often mentioned together, but despite both being authoritarian, they have entirely different ENDS and ideals that they wish to achieve. The Fascist end-goal and Communist end-goal are entirely different."
971,Ask_Politics,Is it possible for Bernie Sanders to win every state and still not get the nomination?,"Yes, it is possible because of how the Democratic party allocates convention delegates, that being said it would be very unlikely.  Essentially, there are no winner-take-all states.  So, in primary states (caucuses are slightly different), any candidate that clears 15% will be awarded a relative percentage of the state's total delegates.  So, Bernie may hit 20% in every state and win the most votes and delegates; however, it is also possible that in this secnario 4-5 other candidates also clear the 15% threshhold, which would lead to a major delegate split and it would be very difficult for any candidate to win a majority of total convention delegates.

All of that being said, a primary season is meant to gauge popular support.  There is some debate among political scientists as to what effect the primaries actually have on who the nominee is.  However, I would say that if you want Bernie to get elected, or you don't, your vote in a Super Tuesday state will most definitely play a role in determining the final delegate count."
972,Ask_Politics,Is there a strategy in presidential candidates polling below 1% remaining in the race this far in?,"Visibility. Some of them know they’re not going anywhere after this so they want to get as noticeable as possible. That way they can get a TV gig with a cable network- think of Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee, Kasich, etc."
973,Ask_Politics,"Yang could get elected, but the House fails to pass UBI, what are other reasons someone would vote for Yang?","Dude wants to eliminate the penny. He says MMA fighters need a union due to unfair practices relative to other sports.

I dunno. Just something refreshing about someone pointing out actually achievable things to fix rather than nonstop existential crisis."
974,Ask_Politics,How do we institute ranked choice voting in all states?,"I think that the state-wide level is probably the best and most realistic way of implementing this in the short term, although it could be possible if a political party had a majority in government. Maine is a great example of this. 

[Article I, section IV of the US Constitution](https://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec4.html) says that the state & federal legislatures (congress) have the ability to make laws & regulations regarding elections (except senators, which were elected by state legislatures until the passage of the 17th amendment). Basically, you don't need a constitutional amendment to implement ranked choice voting and the constitution allows for such regulation. 

[H.R. 1](https://www.fairvote.org/h_r_1_advances_ranked_choice_voting) would implement ranked choice voting at the national level, but has since stalled in the Senate ([you can thank Mitch McConnell](https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/remarks/hr-1-a-democrat-political-power-grab))."

977,Ask_Politics,"In a poll, 74% of Americans want to see Trump's tax returns. Is this a reasonable request to make of a politician? Can Trump block this through legal means?","There is no requirement that a politician should show their tax returns.

It's tradition, but not law."
978,Ask_Politics,Is it true Trump’s impeachment cost tens of millions of dollars? Or is it true his impeachment actually made more money than it cost?,"I haven't heard this claim about the impeachment. The impeachment itself only lasted a few days and was likely funded by Congress's existing operational budget. Maybe you're referring to the Mueller investigation, which did spend millions of dollars employing lawyers and investigators? However it's also true they did recover more than that by seizing assets obtained through criminal means.

It's also worth mentioning that most people who use that as a criticism of the Mueller investigation don't actually care about the cost. They just didn't like that it existed and we're looking for any reason to speak poorly about it. I am confident they would have gladly spent tens of millions of dollars on an investigation if they knew it would have exonerated Trump."
979,Ask_Politics,How easy/hard is it really to illegally vote with mail-in ballots?,"The alleged argument against it is that it would lead to increased illegal voting (same thing for state ID requirement laws). But, there’s virtually no evidence of real voter fraud in this country (and it’s been studied a lot). It’s sad but true. The real argument against it is that it would hurt a particular party in this country that has a vested interest in keeping voter participation down."
980,Ask_Politics,Why would someone objectively vote for Warren over Sanders or vice versa Sanders over Warren?,"Warren over Sanders:

* Policy wonk. Warren, frankly, is very smart. She seems to know her policies in detail, and she's already written bills for lots of them. Sanders is good at identifying problems, but is a bit more lacking in the detail department. With Warren you know she's ready to start pushing legislation from Day 1.
* Bernie Sanders calls himself a socialist. This is an electability problem. The Red Scare has ingrained an extremely negative connotation onto the word ""socialism"" in the eyes of the public. It's seen as almost un-American. Warren will be labeled a socialist by the GOP as all Dem candidates are, but at least she doesn't call herself that and wear it with pride like Bernie does. A self-proclaimed socialist who rants and yells about political revolution is just gonna turn off a segment of the population, although we don't know how much.
* Warren has closer ties to the Democratic Party, and will most likely have an easier time getting the party in line as President compared to Bernie. Also, she's not as far left as Bernie, which will help in that department too. Of course, if the GOP still keep the Senate and obstruct then this doesn't matter, but it's something worth considering.
* Bernie is old. He's not currently showing signs of health issues or mental decline, but he's 78. At the end of a second term, he would be 87 years old. An 87 year old doing an incredibly stressful and time consuming job. Which means that his VP choice is extremely important, because there's a solid likelihood he gets sick or dies and the VP has to take over. With Warren that's less of a risk.

Sanders over Warren:

* Sanders has a history of outstanding character. He marched against segregation and was arrested for it in the 60s. There's videos of him defending gay marriage like 20-30 years before it was politically acceptable to do so. As minor as it seems, Trump will hammer Warren on the Native American thing as much as he can, he'll use it to undermine her character at any possibility.
* Sanders is undeniably genuine. He's held consistent beliefs for most of his political career, and as an Independent he didn't have to tow the party line.
* Electability, namely charisma and name recognition. Warren's pretty nerdy, in both appearance and voice, which is concerning because as U.S. history can tell us, charisma decides Presidential elections. JFK, Nixon, Bush Jr., the ""beer factor"" is real and it's important. Sanders is proven likeable (at least relative to Trump) and has a dedicated fanbase who will turn out for him. Not that Warren isn't at all likeable, or that she'd necessarily struggle on a national stage, but we already know that people like and remember Sanders.
* Sanders is willing to go further left than any candidate. His policy ideas are full of big lofty social plans (like the housing one he just came out with), so if you're someone who's **very** left, he's more appealing."
981,Ask_Politics,"German Tourist here: Is it an US-Politics thing, that there are rarely Sidewalks in Florida?","It is as much this as we actually do have auto-lobbies lobbying to keep cities more automobile-friendly. National Highway Users Conference is one of them, I believe created by GM. Cities were intentionally designed for cars. American Transit Association (ATA) and the American Institute of Planners helped lobby for the freeways that cross through much our of cities today, too.

What ended up happening leads to something we all know, Urban Sprawl. When you have such strong networks of streets in your city, why live in the city itself? People would end up believing that, cities being cramped, it'd be nice to own property and just drive to work instead of the more European-style structure of living in a larger city where mass transit and biking/walking became far more common options. By encouraging people to live in suburban areas, this cut down public transit because their range had to be too wide, which eventually meant you NEEDED a car to get into the city.

This of course leads to two major problems wrt to taxes: 1, now the idiot city council members who got bribed here realize that their taxes have fallen completely off because all their population moved to suburban areas. 2, Now those people, inner city who couldn't move, are of lower-income and can't pay much into taxes, and need social safetynet programs including access to vehicles because how else do you get to work?

So now you also have to create parking garages because much of your populace travels. Normally, this is expensive because of all the property prices in inner cities. Spoilers: Still was. You do so immediately, build the garages... what's that? No one's coming? Oh yeah, because now that your populace sprawled, businesses are following people. The businesses in your cities are now less prosperous because their populace is gone and they gradually sprawl to. So what now?

Well, you CAN do what Cleveland did: Hey, look at all this empty space, let's create MORE PARKING. And what happens? City sprawls more because now its ugly, property value is low due to low income individuals, low native population, and these ugly parking garages everywhere.

You can also do what Chicago/Detroit did: Nothing. Which of course causes the same despondent issues, just -the garages.

How have these cities recovered? Up until recently, not at all. Chicago lost nearly 40% of its population from the direct metropolitan areas, but kinda compensated by just calling all composite suburban areas 'Chicago'. Every rust belt city affected by the automobile lobby faced MASSIVE sprawl, from Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, and Penn. Some cities started to recover, mainly Cleveland due to what amounted to like 100mil from an RNC stay, a few major events (the All Star Game, the Cavs being really good for some time) and the destruction of a lot of old, decrepit buildings and free/near-free renovation of houses for residents in Cleveland. The focus now has been on creating sidewalks, parks (Cleveland Metroparks), night life, and encouraging younger individuals to come live in Cleveland for lower costs. It's slowly worked, but this is the exact opposite of what the automobile lobby wants.

Essentially, yes, the Automobile lobby is both responsible for the bad layouts of cities, but also directly responsible for their despondent economic situations/American sprawl.

Also the R18 Automod here is *really* dumb. We're all adults, suppressing any language by auto-deletes is lazy."
982,Ask_Politics,How do I properly educate myself about Politics?,"To get a basic general grounding, ask either a lecturer or first-year student in your university's PoliSci department for the booklist for their 101 course. These are curated to include the most significant works and perspectives on the topic, while remaining approachable for a beginner. They'll all be available in your university library, as a bonus.

If you have to pick two, go with Rawls' *Theory of Justice* and Nozick's counterarguing *Anarchy, State and Utopia*. There are more important works (Mills, Hobbes, etc), but for a grounding in modern political discourse those two best balance current relevance with academic rigour on topics like 'big state/little state' and 'negative freedoms/positive freedoms'. A platform to build on, that many will *assume* you've read if you want to talk about the topic of the day with any authority.

_____

While you're getting the basics down, start reading and listening to discussions of current events. Most importantly **find someone you disagree with**, and listen to them. If you're conservative, read liberal publications. If you're a liberal, listen to conservative podcasts. Pick an argument you think they're on the wrong side of, and *look for yourself* to find evidence that they're wrong. If you can find some, you're better informed. If you can't find any, consider what that implies. 

If you don't even understand the argument, ask questions and look for background, either on the topic or the people arguing the topic to find out why things are as they are. Keep doing that, keep challenging what you hear and what you think. Iron sharpens iron, as the proverb goes."
983,Ask_Politics,Why does the US want to spend money on stopping illegal immigration and not the people that hire illegals?,"Nobody *actually* wants to stop it. Not Democrats (humanitarian concerns, keeps the Latino vote reliably in their corner), and not Republicans (business groups like the cheap, compliant labor, and it keeps poor rural voters directing their anger down instead of up). "
984,Ask_Politics,How rare is it for all 4 dissenting SCOTUS justices to issue their own separate dissents?,"Pretty rare. The 2 cases you mentioned, Medellín v. Texas & United States v Booker are the only 4 times it's happened since 2000."

986,Ask_Politics,"Is the tax foundation a credible source? If so, can someone help understand how Biden’s tax proposal will affect small businesses? Does the $400,000 rule apply to businesses as well?","The Tax Foundation is technically non-partisan, but they're often described as having a conservative lean.  I don't think they're outright lying, just that their conclusions might have some bias.  (i.e., their models of long-term economic effects)

Before 2017, the corporate income tax rate was 35%.  The TCJA reduced it to 21%.  Biden's plan would split the difference at 28%.  This tax rate applies to all businesses that are not ""pass through"" businesses for tax purposes.  (Mostly C corporations.)

Payroll taxes would remain unchanged on incomes under $400,000.  Above $400,000, the Social Security tax would become payable again.

Keep in mind that almost no President has been able to enact their exact tax proposal -- after all, the laws originate in Congress, so none of this is a certainty even if Biden is elected."

- The DOJ denied they had anything to do with the Ukraine call.

I think I read they’ve done less than 35 prosecutions in the last X years of employers.  Part of why MS was targeted by ICE is the lack of defendant infrastructure plus distance, to allow more effective operations.  (Also kids left behind and lack of defense counsel).

Over half of the immigrants have been released from custody with a promise to return to court, since the non-criminal warrants were all administrative anyway.  Others were shifted around ICE centers in MS and LA."

991,Ask_Politics,Why is there so much hatred towards Hillary Clinton?,"She sucks on tv, and the Republicans have been preparing to run against her for decades.  Many youngish voters have been hearing about how awful Hillary is supposed to be almost their entire lives.  Without being able to push a better media face, people tend to default to what they're used to hearing.  

Now, people will always find a justification somewhere to say x policy is a deal breaker or whatever, but all politicians that have been around that long have something in their history that can be used as an excuse to oppose them, but Hillary gets more heat than anyone else.  People are talking about LBGT issues but conveniently forget that Obama's (and a ton of other Democrats') views ""evolved"" around the same time.  Sure, she voted for the Iraq war, but so did 28 other Democrats, but she's the one that gets labelled a war hawk.  "

The error bars on the national scale were actually lower than usual. We did see an unusual amount of error from state polls in Wisconsin, but that's hardly a big deal and state polls have always had more variance than usual.

The next highest reason for not voting is apathy. Just don’t care. This is often because they don’t feel like their vote counts. Electoral college system means your vote literally may not count.

994,Ask_Politics,"The ""people like their insurance plan"" argument, is it real?","I know several people who pay $25-100 a month for objectively good insurance. I know some union guys who pay more but for **GREAT** insurance. Knee surgery for $100 great. Insurance negotiated over multiple union contracts after extracting other concessions. Even I pay $60 a month for somewhat crummy insurance, but I never use it for much so my out of pocket cost is still under $500 a year + premiums. Those people are almost certainly short/medium-term losers under a MFA plan and I’ll tell you why: *greed.*

Their employers, my employer, and employers across the country are unlikely to take the $5000-$10000 that they are no longer spending on behalf of the employee for that insurance and raise employee pay. They’re just not, it’s a fantasy. Capitalists don’t pay labor. So for those folks their taxes are going to go up, higher than what they are paying for insurance, and it is unlikely to be offset by corresponding wage increases. Employers are greedy, you weren’t seeing that money in your paycheck before now, so they’re just going to pocket it and give it to shareholders or buy a plane. 

Long term, it’s probably better for almost everyone, but getting people to do that math when their paychecks have gone down because taxes went up isn’t going to be easy."

You don't tell people how to spend their money when they're working for it or get it as a gift.

However, the answer to your question would probably be the same way we regulate behaviours now. We use laws with punishments and incentives for behaviour. It's illegal to buy... Illegal drugs, it's illegal to neglect your kids, etc.

997,Ask_Politics,Why are UK leaders so committed to Brexit when most of them didn't want to do it in the first place?,"Woo these answers.

The actual answer is that there was a referendum. Yes, it's non-binding, and yes, they could have another one, but those are two disturbing precedents to set, and it would most likely cost the people who campaigned on leaving the support of the people who voted to leave, who at the very least are close to half the country.

Imagine if the UK had voted to remain instead, and then proceeded to leave anyway, or continue having more votes until they got the result they wanted (*cough* May *cough*)? That'd be pretty ridiculous. So instead, May seems set on continuing down the Brexit path even though her own party is unsatisfied with the plan she negotiated with the EU."
998,Ask_Politics,"Today Democrats took majority in the House, Why could Republicans not vote to pass a budget before this, while they had the majority in all of congress?","The senate has a procedural rule (set by itself, for itself, and maintained by members from both parties who mostly support it) that it takes 60 votes to move most legislation to a vote. This used to apply to judicial appointments too, but this rule has been eliminated recently. (In 2013, democrats eliminated the requirement for nominees except the Supreme Court, and in 2017 Republicans eliminated it for the Supreme Court.) This why the Kavenaugh confirmation only needed a majority.

If you've heard about Trump telling Mitch McConnel to use the ""nuclear option"", he's referring to changing that procedural rule. McConnel has repeatedly stated that the votes are not there to do so.

You can learn about the rules here: https://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_index_subjects/Rules_and_Procedure_vrd.htm 

Edit: The House of Representatives has its own set of rules as well. These are in the news right now because several members of the progressive wing of the House Democrats refused to support the rules package introduced by Nancy Pelosi unless the ""PAYGO"" rule is eliminated.

Carter appointed Paul Volcker to the Fed to tackle Nixon's crisis. Volcker sharply raised interest rates. That move is credited with saving the economy, and setting it up for growth, which Reagan took credit for.

This is very much in line with the pattern we've seen over the last 30 years. Conservatives created economic disasters which had to be cleaned up under Democratic administrations."
1000,Ask_Politics,How is Gerrymandering still not illegal?,"Because it's hard to define.

There is actually precedent that in some jurisdictions it is legally mandatory to gerrymander a minority group together in the same district so that they have a representative rather than their population being split among other districts where they are too small to get recognition. "
1001,Ask_Politics,George W. Bush is often mentioned as one of the worst presidents in history. Is such sentiment warranted?,"I believe there is general consensus that the Iraq war was a massive blunder, and it remains true that the so-called ""Bush tax cuts"" contribute enormously to the deficit. The two lingering accomplishments of his presidency, therefore, are not looked on fondly. Bush's response to 9/11 is the massive, bloated government surveillance industry people are now all upset over.

It is also important to remember that he had many more ideas that he failed to push through. The Administration did announce a strategy to privatize Social Security that went no where. Republicans in Congress fought lengthy regulatory battles with the EPA and SEC to effectively gut their ability to regulate much of anything, that Democrats successfully blocked.

I believe that the war in Iraq was an enormous mistake that will hamper American foreign policy for decades, and that by imposing a massive deficit increase in the form of a politically irrevocable tax cut, the Bush Presidency really does stand as one of our worst. Bush as a President mostly failed to get much done, but where he succeeded, we are still suffering the consequences.

It is important to note that George Bush himself seemed to have very few ideas of his own about governance. I think he was mostly an empty vessel into which his administration could pour policy focus. He was mostly subjected to the whims of the conservative interests that put him in office. The Iraq war was wholly engineered by his staff. So when people are saying that Bush was a good/bad President, they're really saying his *Administration* was full of bad *ideas.*"

>The main reason companies are supporting CISPA is because it takes the pressure to regulate users off the private company... CISPA transfers that role and responsibility over to a government entity. Effectively, it protects companies from being sued if they break their Terms of Service to hand over user information if it's deemed a threat to cyber security.

Now, I don't think it *should* be regulated by the government, but the latter part I understand fully - the threat of lawsuits.

It actually is a pretty good rundown.  Take the time to read it."
1004,Ask_Politics,How much support does BLM actually have amongst the US and UK working class when it comes to removing statues?,I can't speak for anyone but myself but I think that a person should only have a statue if they have done more good than bad. I fully support BLM and the removal of the statues of slave owners or slavers but I people like Winston Churchill should have a statue as he was the UK PM during world war 2 and that should be respected.
1005,Ask_Politics,What's the difference between the two US parties views on liberty/freedom?,"Both are not consistent with regards to classical liberty / freedom. Like you said:


Conservatives want:


* More restrictions regarding abortion, marriage, immigration, drugs, etc.
* Fewer restrictions regarding business, guns, making faith based decisions, etc. 


Liberals want:


* More restrictions regarding business, environment, guns, etc. 
* Fewer restrictions regarding abortion, marriage, drugs, etc.


It’s US Libertarians (different from US Liberals) that want the most classical liberty / freedom and smallest government."

1008,Ask_Politics,What caused Trump's massive rise in popularity in July 2015?,"He announced and the media obsessed over him.  On July 6th  he said Mexico  ""forcing their most unwanted people into the United States [...] in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc. 

This was played non-stop by the media.  Imagine if the media today played on Marianne Williamson's remarks non-stop.  All you would do is hear about her, and you wouldn't hear about the other candidates.  That would make her rise in the polls."
1009,Ask_Politics,How exactly did the DNC rig the primaries in favor of Hillary?,"The [DNC favored hillary](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/top-dnc-staffer-apologizes-for-email-on-sanders-religion-226072), that was clear from the email leaks, but thats about it. 

the closest thing to actual tampering with election was a [voter purge](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/officials-investigating-why-126000-voters-were-purged-from-ny-rolls/) in the NYC region, ~~a bernie stronghold~~ (see comment from /u/Anomaj). However, even if bernie won all the votes from the purged voter list, [he still would have been about 100 thousand votes short of winning NY state, roughly](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/primaries/NY)

This should be a lesson to the DNC, you can't back candidates you like ahead of time, especially candidates that are so wildly unpopular as Mrs Clinton was.

1010,Ask_Politics,Why isn't Trump's answer on abortion all over the front page?,"I think there are two parts to that. 

One being Reddit it not a great source for even coverage of political news. The front page of all the main poltics subreddits is basically pro Bernie, and Hillary is Satan. Reddits voting system allows for manipulation of news once a large chunk of people decide to all up vote and down vote the same way. So all the pro Bernie and anti Hillary news on reddit drowns out almost all the other news from the whole election.

Second part is that Trump says stupid, uneducated, fucked up things on a daily basis. Every day he makes tweets and quotes that are news worthy for how outrageous they are. At first everything he said was shocking to people and made headlines, but now I think people have started to lose interest. His behavior is just what we expect out of him, so most people just kind of shrug it off and are not shocked by it anymore, so its not making headlines."
1011,Ask_Politics,Alternatives to the three-branch structure?,"In most parliamentary democracies the legislature and the executive branch are considered one branch. An independent judiciary is seen as essential to the function of a democratic government. In some countries, this is called into question. Legislators in these countries sometimes complain that judges do not represent public opinion. But that’s basically the whole point of having an independent judiciary: to not impose the will of  majority or populist politicians on underrepresented groups. 
For example, private property laws represent the interest of a minority- the individual. Society can decide they don’t like a certain individual for whatever reason and vote to confiscate their property. With an independent judiciary, such policies would be blocked."

1014,Ask_Politics,What could a Bernie/Warren president do realistically?,"The president does not have unilateral control of government finances. Remember, Congress controls the pursing power.

2. They'd be able to ramp up measures to curb climate change and increase environmental protections. 

3. They could ramp up anti-discrimination efforts through the Department of Education and Housing. 

4. Promote research into clean energy through DOE. 

5. SCOTUS Justices- this is why we need to take back the Senate in 2020. Poor Ginsburg has waiting for too long and we've got to do good by her by winning the Senate, along with the WH."
1015,Ask_Politics,How was Bernie cheated in the 2016 election?,"> I recently saw the Michael Moore film Farenheit 11/9 where he touches on it, and it seemed to show definitive proof that the primary was rigged. Moore specifically covers West Virginia's primaries, but I was hoping to get more information.  

If I'm remembering correctly (and I might not be, so someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong), Moore's argument that the 2016 primary was ""rigged"" was based on the fact that superdelegates were voting for candidates that didn't win the states the superdelegates were from, thus pushing a state's delegate total to a different candidate than the one who won the popular vote in the state. This is a pretty specious argument for a number of reasons. Firstly, superdelegates have never been tied to popular vote results, so making an argument based on the idea that they are (or should be) is already somewhat questionable. Secondly, Clinton handily won the national popular vote (by 12%) as well as the pledged delegate count (by 8%) so the idea the superdelegates tilted the nationwide outcome is flat-out wrong. She won with or without superdelegates. Thirdly, superdelegates don't even vote until the convention (and at the convention, they have never once in the history of the modern presidential primary nominated anyone other than the pledged delegate leader), so if Sanders had somehow made up the (substantial) deficit he found himself in regarding pledged delegates, it's likely (though I guess not guaranteed) that the superdelegates would have flipped to him and given him the nomination -- this is what we saw in 2008, where Clinton had a large superdelegate lead over Obama, and given how close the pledged delegate and popular vote count were, would have been able to win if those superdelegates stuck with her, but once Obama pulled ahead in the pledged delegate lead\*, superdelegates flipped to him and he won the nomination. 

It's also worth pointing out that Sanders' own 2016 campaign manager was one of the people who originally implemented the superdelegate system in the 70s or 80s, so he has no excuse for not knowing all those rules ahead of time. Clinton spent years building relationships in the party (which is why she had so many endorsements and superdelegates on her side from the start); Sanders could have done the same, but he refused to even officially join the party until running for President and frequently attacked and belittled its members and leadership, so it's no surprise that he didn't have many friends willing to go to bat for him in 2016. And after his repeated unfounded and untrue accusations of the process being rigged, he's in even worse shape in that regard in 2020. 

Stepping back to Moore, though, he's trying to muddy the waters by tying superdelegate outcomes in states Clinton lost (e.g. WV) to the pledged delegate /popular vote count in that state, while ignoring that the national pledged delegate and popular vote count were both massively in Clinton's favor and that the superdelegates themselves ended up being irrelevant. There was no ""rigging.""

Moore also conveniently ignores things like the horribly undemocratic caucus system used by many states that disenfranchises millions of would-be voters which gave Sanders a massive advantage. The abyssal turnout you see in caucuses versus presidential primaries makes it clear that they absolutely prevent people from voting to an even worse extent than stringent voter ID laws or other deliberately anti-democratic measures put into place (usually by the GOP) to decrease turnout. But Moore didn't make a peep about this because he isn't upset that the primary was unfair, he's upset that the candidate he like lost, and is making a deliberately dishonest argument to try and paint it as ""rigged"" when it wasn't. 

You might also hear people make argument's different from Moore's about why or how the election was rigged. I won't go into full detail on all of these unless you have specific questions, but having seen dozens of them, they're virtually all based on misleading or straight-up fake news, often involving out-of-context or deliberately misrepresented quotations from the DNC email dump that the Russian government released through WikiLeaks deliberately to harm Clinton's campaign. There wasn't a single email in the dump that showed any wrongdoing by the Clinton campaign, but there are a lot of terrible blog articles spreading disinformation about them anyway (it didn't help that WikiLeaks was editorializing the leaks to deliberately make them look far worse than the actually were). Pretty much the most salacious thing in the whole leak was a handful of DNC staffers saying they disliked Sanders, but there was no evidence they actually *did* anything to disadvantage his campaign, and most of those emails were after he'd been effectively eliminated, anyway.  Many of these claims have been debunked in detail by sites like Politifact.

\*2008 is an interesting case because Obama won the pledged delegate count (and the nomination) while Clinton won the popular vote. However, this was almost certainly due to the odd situation in Florida and Michigan where violations in the DNC's rules stripped those states of their delegates (half were later restored), and Obama removed his name on the ballot in those states. Had it not been for that situation Obama almost definitely would have won the popular vote as well as the pledged delegate count."

1019,Ask_Politics,Why does the US keep letting Saudi Arabia off the hook for all their human rights abuses?,"Because the US doesn't have any other reason to damage relations with Saudi Arabia. As far as international relations go, States only care about human rights abuses when it can be used to rally their population to support military or economic action against the offending country when it violates diplomatic or economic norms in such a way that harms other states.

It's not just allies of the US that get this treatment. North Korea has among the worst violations of human rights, yet the US does nothing about it because it doesn't want harm to come to South Korea, a strong ally and global economic powerhouse.

States don't act with the same kind of moral self-righteousness that individual people do. If they did, there would be a lot more war and conflict and we wouldn't have the interconnected world that allows the Arabian people to experience how the West does things and slowly reform their government to fit our norms without causing major conflict."

1022,Ask_Politics,Is there any evidence of Chinese infiltration into Black Lives Matter and Antifa?,"I would not be surprised to find that the Chinese are working to destabilize the United States, even if only to get a trade advantage over us.

That said, BLM's actions are very well explained by their stated aims and motivations. There is nothing suspicious or strange about what they're doing which would indicate that someone is pulling the strings from behind a curtain. So, I'm not really sure why your friend would think this about them.

""Antifa"" is not a group. They are a loose association of like-thinking individuals. They have no leadership, no defined structure, no hierarchy... none of that. Thus, it is highly unlikely just on the face of it that China is behind them, as there's nothing substantial for China to be directing. Also, and perhaps more significantly, China's form of government is highly right-wing authoritarian (arguably totalitarian), in other words the complete opposite of what anyone *antifascist* would support. They may not be fully fascist in China, but Antifa and the CCP are hardly natural allies.

Your friend sounds to me like a conspiracy nut who doesn't really care about facts as long as he gets to cast nasty aspersions on groups he subjectively dislikes."

1028,Ask_Politics,"Anthony Scaramucci was apparently brought in by Trump to force Reince Priebus ""to leave"" the White House.

At best, this explanation has been used by staunch Trump supporters to retroactively explain Scaramucci's firing as another flawlessly executed move in Trump's ""5D chess game"" so that nobody has to admit the Trump administration ever makes mistakes.

The reality is that Scaramucci's hiring was a mistake that quickly became apparent as soon as he started acting unhinged around the press, something that is particularly damaging for the Communications Director of all positions. Priebus was already on his way out and his ouster had little, if anything,  to do with Scaramucci. Kelly, in his new role as CoS clearly did not want to deal with someone as undisciplined as Scaramucci and ensured he was removed from the position accordingly."
1029,Ask_Politics,Why doesn't the U.S. make Election Day a national holiday?,"The most commonly cited answer to this is that it just wouldn't change much of anything.

For starters, businesses are not required to shut down for national or federal holidays. Those that do close are typically white-collar businesses that employee people that can afford to travel to a polling place during lunch, or before going in to the office. Restaurants, hospitals, mechanics, etc. don't usually close for holidays, and their employees usually can't afford to take the day off to vote.

tl;dr: Making election day a national holiday would give current voters a day off work, but wouldn't necessarily make it any easier for non-voters to get to the polls."

1031,Ask_Politics,Why do we ask what the founding fathers would have wanted?,"I'm not personally a fan of the originalist doctrine, but as a means of interpreting the Constitution, the idea is that the laws and foundations of government don't change just because, for instance, the colloquial meanings of words happen to change over time. The argument goes that we should interpret the words as they would have been understood *at the time they were written*, just as we might when reading a contract -- whatever was agreed to at the time is binding, and there are specific processes in place to change the terms of the contract/Constitution if they need to be changed to suit the changing needs of the people. See [this article](http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/blog/2011/01/why-originalism/) for a more complete explanation.

More generally, if you're referring to how the founding fathers would feel about any given policy (and not just whether it comports legally with the Constitution they wrote), it is an [appeal to authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority) argument. Liberal and Conservative Americans all tend to agree that the founding fathers were smart, admirable guys and did a fine job establishing the country on sound principles, including writing what is now the oldest (and shortest) written constitution still in use by a national government. They are one legitimately authoritative source that most Americans find trustworthy about a lot of things -- certainly more trustworthy than any of those jerks in Washington today. Therefore, if the founding fathers are trustworthy and were right about lots of things, and if they also think X, then perhaps they are right about X.

Naturally, this is not always a valid argument, for lots of reasons. But the above might explain why people use that reasoning, and why it might seem intuitively appealing."
1032,Ask_Politics,What's wrong with the EU (or similar large trade union) enacting tariffs based on human rights?,"It's possible. The issue is escalation. The thing you have to keep in mind is it comes down to how much pressure you can apply, can you apply universal pressure and does the governing power have the internal political ability to change positions. 

As an American, the conversation for decades about China and their human rights abuses was something along the lines of ""the more we trade with them, the more rights they'll adopt."" We now know that if there is a way to continue exploitation like changing trading partners or enacting counter tariffs, they'll do that. Countries like Russia will also use the lack of trade or friction to start building relationships. 

Take for example North Korea, whose human rights abuses are well known. They are embargoed probably more than any other nation but because they have Chinese support, they can continue to operate as normal so long as they maintain just that one relationship. 

You also have to understand that in some cases, the human rights violations are a method for holding onto power.  So capitulating to a foreign powers influence can be seen as weakness and internal enemies of a regime might unify and overthrow those in power if they detect said weakness. So even if you apply that pressure and those in power want to do something they might not for the sake of their own survival. 

But the sentiment that we should motivate moral governing behavior through financial and trade means is a good idea. It just has to be a nearly universal move. We have to make the incentives for human rights greater than the incentives for exploitation not just to the country, but the individuals who run that country as well."

I've definitely heard a comparison with this upheaval being the preceding time period to progressive reform. A lot of parallels, like the actual breakdown of society in short term demonstrations/ law enforcements, and also the underlying wealth disparity."
1035,Ask_Politics,Do any other countries have similar lobbying problems that the United States does?,"Lobbying in favour of a particular industry against the public interest is a thing everywhere, but it's potentially more effective in the US because of the sheer volume of money in politics. There are FAR stricter rules around how political parties can spend money in other countries; During the campaign for the UK’s 2017 general election, political parties, candidates, and non-party campaigners spent around £40 million in total. In the 2016 US election, presidential candidates, Senate and House candidates, political parties, and outside interest groups spent about $6.5 billion trying to influence federal elections.

There are ideological reasons for this; EU/UK elections cap party political spending because the ideal is fairness (it wouldn't be fair for a party to simply buy an election) whereas in the US the primary ideal is freedom, i.e. money equals speech.

The practical outcome of this is that running for office in the US requires serious fundraising; at least a partial focus for even people seeking the lowliest of political offices has to be getting money to be able to campaign. This is why AOC launched a fundraising arm to be able to help progressive candidates without relying on the DCCC, and why lobbyists who can help keep political war chests full wield more influence in US politics. 

That's not to say that the UK doesn't have its own issues; in the house of parliament and the house of lords is the City 'remembrancer', essentially a lobbyist for the banking industry, but on steroids. Because pretty much all English monarchs have been heavily in debt to banks, the role of Remembrancer was created in the 1500's to “remind the king of his debt” and make sure the City’s (meaning banks and business) interests were never again affected by ­Parliament. It's an unelected role administered entirely by the City Of London Corporation, but when Parliament is sitting he has a special seat to the right of the Speaker in the House of Commons. The post has a team of 6 lawyers with a degree of access that would blow your mind and as a result wields ENORMOUS power to influence and change legislation that might negatively affect the City. A previous ­Remembrancer boasted his role was to “oppose every bill which would interfere with the rights and privileges enjoyed by the City."" 

Anyway, I think you're kind of asking the wrong question. Focussing on lobbyists is only half the story; what is arguably far more damaging is the idea of [regulatory capture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture)
All of the examples you've cited above, from prison reform to auto manufacture, are far more influenced by the people setting the rules around conduct than the legislative body. Remember the whole thing around Net Neutrality? Viacom and AT+T or whoever didn't need to lobby too hard to end net neutrality because the FCC, the group who set the rules, was entirely run by people who were sympathetic to their cause, namely Ajit Pai, an ex-Verizon employee. 

This isn't a unique case. Regulatory capture has happened (not happening, already happened) in every major regulatory body in the US. The FEC chairperson used to work for the RNC, the SEC chairman used to represent Goldman Sachs, the FAA chair is an ex-Delta Executive etc etc etc. This is where the real rot is; lobbyists are a small slice of a far more insidious problem that sits at the heart of corporatism in US (and indeed global) political legislation."
1036,Ask_Politics,Why didn't the USA use it's anti-missile system to defend the bases housing U.S. troops?,"best theory I've heard is that Iran needed to save face over the situation, contacted Iraq as a back channels and asked that pretty please could they shoot some missiles into an empty lot and then call it even."
1037,Ask_Politics,Why is Iran in Iraq in the first place?,"There are three principal reasons Iran is interested in Iraq. Security, regional power, and ideology

For Security, Iraq has a very long border with Iran, and Iraq and Iran previously fought a long and very bloody war in the 80s. Iran wants to make sure that border is controlled by forces that are Iranian-aligned: if Iraq were to fall back into the US camp, the Iranians would be afraid that the US could use Iraqi territory as a base to invade Iran. So Iran is attempting to grow its influence in Iraq to make sure that the country remains at least neutral, if not Iranian aligned

The second is regional power. Iran has aspirations of being a major player in the Middle East, but the US has largely combated this, and has made the Middle East mostly friendly to America and opposed to Iran. Iraq is a prime target to grow Iranian power and influence in a large and important country in the region, and one right next door. Furthermore, a Iranian-aligned Iraq would make it easier for Iran to support its allies in Syria and Lebanon

The third reason is ideology. Iran is a Shia muslim theocracy, and sees itself as both a protector and leader of Shia muslims in the Middle East. Iraq is a majority Shia country, which gives Iran a further interest in expanding its influence there for ideological reasons

> I dont understand what a general from Iran was doing in Baghdad

He was meeting the leaders of some of the top Iran-backed militia units in Iraq, Khatib Hezbollah. This is the same militia unit that had occupied parts of the US embassy in Baghdad a few days ago

> If Iran is causing trouble and threatening the sovereignty of the Iraqis shouldn't we do something

It's a very complicated situation. Iran's influence in Iraq has been growing since the US withdrawal, but it kicked into high gear after the ISIS invasion of Iraq. Iran helped fund, train, and arm Shia militias in Iraq (known as Popular Mobilization Units, or PMUs), partly to fight ISIS, but partly just to take over security and policing in Shia areas of Iraq so that the Iraqi security forces could go north and fight ISIS (the PMUs had an unfortunate tendency to kill sunni civilians in areas they ""liberated"" from ISIS, so they were mostly kept off the front lines). And even though the ISIS threat is largely gone, the PMUs aren't going anywhere. It gets more complicated as the Iraqi government largely supports the PMUs, and the PMUs have an official role in the Iraqi military chian of command. The Iraqi government is run by Shia muslims who largely support Iran, so they don't mind Iran's presence. But on the other hand, the PMUs are largely responsible for the mass killing of peaceful protesters in Iraq in recent months, protesters who oppose the Iranian presence in Iraq

> Did Iraqi officials approve the action?

Publicly, no. For one, nobody likes foreign countries conducting airstrikes in their own country, and especially against major foreign political figures in your own capital. It's humiliating, especially as the US didn't ask for permission or give advanced notice (because then Solemani would be told he was a target, and wouldn't have shown up for the meeting). For another, several people killed were senior PMU officials, who are technically part of the Iraqi government. Iraq condemned the strike, and major Iraqi government officials have joined funeral processions

But on the other hand, it's very unlikely that the US could have assembled the intelligence to know where to launch this airstrike without cooperation with people in the know within the Iraqi government. It's possible that some elements of the Iraqi government did support this strike, while others (probably the larger part) did not support it"
1038,Ask_Politics,"For Sanders 2016 supporters who think the Democratic primary was “rigged” against Bernie, why/how?","I'm not a Sanders supporter making this claim. But those who do, often cite the presence of [superdelegates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdelegate), who supported Clinton by a massive margin. The superdelegates did not mathematically decide the end result of the nomination, but they were able to give Clinton a massive delegate lead before a primary single vote was cast. The criticism was that this early lead influenced how people voted, and dampened the potential enthusiasm for Bernie by making him appear as more of a longshot candidate. 

Also, another criticism was that the debates were scheduled on particular days that were likely to have lower viewership. I don't remember the specifics.

There's not a particularly strong argument that I've seen that he was screwed out of the nomination. Though it was pretty clear that the DNC did prefer Clinton. And that alone makes it worthwhile to hold the DNC accountable when their actions work in Clinton's favor. Dramatic assumptions and all.

It's worth noting that the DNC has changed their rules in response to the controversy; superdelegates now cannot cast votes in the first round of the nomination process. This means that they will only affect the nomination process if the regular delegates (bound to primary results) don't reach a majority decision."

Fast forward to earlier this year and the contractor had hiked the price another 40 billion, and were years behind schedule.  By this June, Morrison was telling France that his government was losing confidence that the contract was still in the best interest of Australia's national security, and that a final determination was coming.  

Meanwhile the US has been looking to shift focus towards the Pacific theatre and Chinese containment for years.  They particularly have been looking to counter China's massive naval buildup.  Recently, a post-brexit UK looking to assert itself after breaking away from the EU approached the US with an interest in beefing up its presence and its commitments to the Pacific theatre.  And both saw Australia as a vital partner in any Chinese containment strategy.  So the three started talking, and saw Australia's submarine investment as an opportunity to give naval forces a boost.  Instead of continuing with the out of control diesel sub contract with France, the US and UK would share technology to enable Australia to build its own nuclear submarines.  The result?  The US and UK not only solidify the pacific alliance with Australia, but we get a bunch of friendly world class subs into the pacific without the US or UK having to pay for them and send a strong message to China that we're serious about countering their increasingly belligerent stance in the Pacific, particularly the South China Sea.

France claims they've been boxed out of this alliance but that's largely bullshit.  France has made clear its intent to remain comparatively neutral in our disagreements with China.  Pretending they have serious desires to join an alliance designed to counter China is disingenuous.  So really this is about someone losing money on the end of a contract they couldn't meet the agreed to terms of.  And when they were called out for throwing a childish tantrum on the global stage they got mad and doubled down by recalling Ambassadors.  The strategy now seem to be: throw a big enough fit everyone else just apologizes to move on.  But long term this is little more than hurt feelings.  The relationship between the US and France goes back centuries and this will be little more than a historical footnote in a couple years.  There's no danger to that relationship breaking."

1045,Ask_Politics,How accurate is the movie Vice?,"After the movie I looked into it a lot. Everything that is verifiable is true. They worked a lot on accuracy. There are obviously parts that are speculation or best guesses. I personally feel it was obvious when that was the case. Here's some reading I did:

I notice that most of the claims that it's false rely on rebuttals from people in the Cheney orbit who obviously have a reason to deny it. And the last piece weirdly doesn't seem to claim that it's inaccurate in any way, just that it's not very good comedy/the characters aren't well fleshed out. I also looked into a lot of the specific events in the movie and was able to verify them, usually with contemporary articles. I think claims of inaccuracy are because the style of the film makes the unspoken spoken, or ""says the quiet part loud,"" such as the scene in the restaurant where they're discussing US policy on torture. Of course it didn't happen like that, but it was an abstract representation of how that policy developed and was justified."
1046,Ask_Politics,Why are the 2020 candidates announcing their candidacies so early?,"The *Pod Save America* guys (who worked on Obama's campaign & in his administration) said it makes sense to declare you are running as early as possible. 

Its not (just) about money. 

Its about *time*. You can get more money later, you can more endorsements later, but you can't buy time. 

When you declare as a candidate early, you get a lot more time to build up a network of supporters at the grassroots level & to get a chance to talk to people about your policies and fine tune your message. The earlier you declare, the more time you have to connect with people in every state & major population area. 

If you are more high profile, you don't get that chance later on, especially if you end up needing Secret Service protection. I wouldn't be surprised if folks like Booker, Harris, Bernie & Warren aren't already there. "
1047,Ask_Politics,What is #ReleaseTheMemo?,"ReleaseTheMemo is a movement to release a FISA memo, to the general public, which has been noted as scathing and rather extreme by a significant number of Senators. It is believed to contain some form of evidence against the former president and several other 'bad actors'. It is currently unclear what evidence is in the memo but speculation has been everything from Russian Collusion Proof to Proof of Obama meddling with elections to widespread government corruption. It is unclear other than the fact that there are many Senators saying that the American people NEED to see this after they have been able to read it. It was only recently been released to the Senate as a whole and was previously restricted to just the intelligence committee."

E: my favorite awnser from the thread 

> I think there are a few forces at work that make a high-profile ""politically conservative"" comedian less likely to be produced.

> Firstly, conservatives are underrepresented amongst the people who would ever pursue a career in comedy in the first place. Going into show business is not a conservative life decision for many reasons. Uncertainty, long road tours away from home, association with drugs and alcohol, association with people with alternative lifestyles, etc. If you were a person who thought that all illegal drug use should be immediately reported then you probably aren't going to find a welcome home on the standup comedy circuit, at least as it exists today. There's also the notion that its said amongst comedians that almost all of them were picked on at home or at school and developed their humor first as an emotional defense mechanism, and my opinion is that people with that perspective have a sort of human empathy that would tend them to being more progressive politically.

> Secondly, I think that with regards to political humor, there is a centuries long history of satire that lampoons the weaknesses of society and of its leaders. That sort of social criticism is inherently progressive, and lack of respect for authority (or at least the belief that authority must be questions) is a trait of liberals.

> Thirdly, I think that left-leaning comedy is broader and more palatable to the multinational corporations that sponsor major television networks. The sponsors don't want to offend anyone. Left-leaning comedians tend against ""punching down"" at people of lower social status. They stick with making fun of politicians, celebrities, and rich people. Politically conservative comedy... what would that be... making fun of welfare cheaters? Making fun of minimum wage workers? Making fun of environmentalists? I'm not even saying that there aren't funny jokes to be made, there certainly are and many have certainly been made on popular mainstream programs that otherwise lean left, but as a general theme of a comedy show? I don't think that would appeal to very many people for very long and I think it would offend a lot of people."

Sorry if this isn’t specific enough, if you want to message me I can try to help!

1053,Ask_Politics,are there any studies on the motivation of Clinton voters who voted for McCain over Obama?,"My thought is that this has more to do with ancestral racist Dixiecrats in the south who wouldn’t vote for a black man. Despite Obama winning by an overwhelming landslide, many states in the south swung Republican by 10 or more points compared to 2004. This was the beginning of the tidal wave of white resentment that led to the Republican landslide of 2010 and culminated with the election of Donald Trump. 

Democrats still held many state legislatures in states like Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and West Virginia until 2010. By 2016, Republicans had all of them. 

While a lot of people seem to discount the racism that Obama faced and the backlash that resulted from his presidency, I firmly believe that the Democratic Party would be in a far better electoral position today and we wouldn’t have Trump if we’d elected Hillary Clinton in 2008."
1054,Ask_Politics,Is it illegal for the President to store classified information on a private server?,It's not to a private server but to a different government server. The different server is supposed to only house transcripts of calls that were sensitive for national security reasons. The calls that are alleged to have moved were not sensitive for national security but rather political reasons. This may not be illegal on it's own but does point to a desire to obstruct any investigation into abuses of power in my mind.
1055,Ask_Politics,Are political polls still considered accurate now that so many people don't pick up calls from numbers they don't know?,"One thing that people constantly forget is that the primary talent of statisticians isn't really just asking huge and perfectly random groups of people a question. It's the mathematical rigor which which they can ask themselves: how many people do I have to ask this to to be x% sure I'm right and what's the margin of error that comes out of the prediction I made?

Yes, it will introduce a bias, but by looking at their data, pollsters should then widen the margin of error of the poll, which can lead them to either adjust other measures to shrink that margin of error or lead you and people reading those poll numbers to see that it's 51% of people +/-5% instead of 1%. Aggregate polling like fivethirtyeight get a lot of power by actually paying attention to error margins, actually paying attention to biases and putting data from many different measures with different biases and error margins together which helps smooth out the issues.

As an example, say I have public data that gives me a list of 200 people, 100 of which are 18-50 and 100 of which are 51-99. They're representing an actual district that's 5k people 18-50 and 10k people 51-99. I may get data that says that 50% of group A votes yes and 70% of group B votes yes. However, I'll also know that because of the make-up of the real population I should proportion it so that I count group B twice as much as group A. But also, based on the response rates I may have a margin of error for group B that's huge and a margin of error for group A that's negligible. And I may also be able to use exit polling (done in person) compared to the census to determine voter turnout for each of these brackets. So, after factoring all of that math it, I might say that the poll tells me that from group B I can say that 40% to 41% of the total vote will vote yes plus another 20 to 26% of the total vote from group A. So, then, the end result of the poll may say 63.5% vote yes with a margin of error of 3.5. The fact that one group had 6 times the margin of error of the other all gets factored in. ... And then, as stated, in aggregate polling that also gets corrected. You have one poll that always undercounts a certain group, you can weight that poll accordingly.

In the end, if poll participation is deeply correlated to poll participation and demographics, you would see the error margins of polls widen. Technically the poll is still ""right"" if you pay attention to that error margin. But in the end, the real question is how deeply tied to certain political positions or demographics poll participation is, not how low the participation is. If the subset of people who respond to polls are truly not representative of the rest of the population, then that creates a problem, but likely the distinction isn't that extreme."
1056,Ask_Politics,Why did the House of Representatives vote to kill the impeachment resolution yesterday?,"Because there isn't a clear political benefit to doing so. The majority of Americans are against impeachment, and while entering impeachment proceedings could shift that, support for impeachment could be short-lived. When Trump is acquitted by the Senate, the narrative that is reported likely won't be many may hear isn't ""The Senate exonerated Trump because they're corrupt,"" but ""The Senate exonerated Trump because Trump is innocent of obstruction."" So any benefit from impeachment only lasts as long as an impeachment trial, and that's assuming backlash doesn't happen sooner, like it did for Clinton's impeachment."

You can search for ""'tough on crime' policies"" if you are interested in more.

It **is** a conflict of interest, but the only people who can do anything about it are Congressional Republicans. There are very few laws specifically governing the president's actions. The intention of the framers of the Constitution was that the Congress, through the impeachment process, would hold the President accountable for any actions which would constitute a violation of the trust placed upon the office. The problem is that Congressional Republicans seem entirely unwilling to hold the President accountable for anything, short of irrefutable evidence of the President violating a law."

1061,Ask_Politics,A US sailor recently put classified info on his laptop. He was Convicted of mishandling classified info. How is this any different that Hillary Clinton having classified info on a private server?,"One big difference is that you're missing part of the circumstances. From Comey's press release: 

> All the cases prosecuted [under these statutes] involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support **an inference of intentional misconduct**; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or **efforts to obstruct justice** (so you can't really say ""I'm not talking about the obstruction of justice charge.). We do not see those things here.

When it comes down to it, the law is written to discourage people from leaking sensitive information, either through disloyalty or blackmail.   [Contrast Clinton's facts with the sailor's case:](http://www.navytimes.com/story/military/crime/2015/08/01/kristian-saucier-alexandria-submarine-pictures-john-walker/30907091/) 

> The photos that raised red flags at NCIS and the FBI included images of various control panels, a panoramic view of the reactor compartment and a panel that showed the condition and exact location of the submarine at the time the photo was taken.

> The FBI alleged that ""an engineer could determine significant design characteristics of a U.S. nuclear submarine"" from the images on Saucier's phone...

> After doing forensics, the FBI claims the photos were taken at odd hours. A photograph of the reactor compartment through a yellow-tinted observation port was taken in January 2009 at 4 a.m.

> **Photographs of a panel in the maneuvering compartment that included the exact location of the Alexandria were taken that March at 1:30 a.m.  And still more pictures, including a panoramic view of the reactor compartment, were taken in March in the early afternoon of July 15...**

> The pictures as described in the complaint could reveal to a trained eye some of the state-of-the-art technology used to silence the hull's noises and the capabilities and configuration of the plant inside the Los Angeles-class attack boat, according to a former sub skipper who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive areas on the boat.

> If espionage was his intent, however, it's unclear how much information on a retiring Cold War-era boat would be valuable to foreign adversaries now.

> What's more likely is that a potential adversary could use an initial and largely worthless transaction with a potential spy as a way of getting the person ""on the hook,"" said Bryan Clark, a retired submarine officer and analyst with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.

So put yourself in a prosecutor's shoes and ask this question: What reasons did Clinton have for using a private email server? (Didn't want to use the NSA approved clunkier system, all prior SOSs had used private systems). What reasons did the sailor have for taking pictures of classified systems that he worked on every day?"
1062,Ask_Politics,Why does Mexico not join NATO?,"NATO membership is not the same as military aid or cooperation. We give plenty if military aid to other countries, and act to mutual benefit with many countries outside of formal alliance structures. 

NATO is built upon its member-nations' common strategic interests in Europe. During the Cold War, this meant a common defense against the Warsaw Pact, today it is more focused on cooperation, stability, and security. The exception here is of course Afghanistan, but it is the first (and will probably be the last) NATO operation outside of Europe. 

Mexico does not have extensive strategic interests in Europe. The USA and Canada both do, based on their long-standing military alliances in the region. The  success of the Monroe Doctrine has ensured that European nations do not have military (as opposed to economic) interests in the Americas. 

Mutual defense from invasion is much less of a concern in North America, thus the lack of a formal alliance organization. We do have strong economic interrelation, which helps explain NAFTA. "

1066,Ask_Politics,I want to learn anything and everything about our political institutions. Any book recommendations?,"If you listen to podcasts, check out Civics 101, that’s just what you’re looking for"
1067,Ask_Politics,Please help me understand. What is the actual finding in the Mueller Report? did Barrs summary accurately explain this?,"The actual finding of the Mueller report amounts to ""this is what we know about what happened.""  It is not, and was *never going to be* a criminal indictment of the President.  This is because Robert Mueller worked for the Justice Department which reports to the Attorney General who reports to the President and, unsurprisingly, it is the position of the White House that the President literally **can not be indicted** for crimes.

Now, the Courts might some day disagree on that front, but there's no reason to expect Mueller or the Justice Department to give up power that the executive branch has claimed for itself (since way before Trump, I might add)

So the limits of what the report **could do** ranged from ""exonerate the President"" (wrt working with the Russian Government and/or obstruction of justice) to ""strongly suggest that the President may have committed crimes"" (accessory/co-conspirator wrt Russia and/or obstruction of justice)

Now, here we get into a bit of a judgement call.  The report **clearly** doesn't exonerate Trump for anything.  It verbosely states that it can't do that based on the evidence in it and Barr even quoted that section.  But the extent to which it suggests that Trump committed crimes is difficult to pin down.  

I find it's easier to reason about this if we just think about this as murder.  I'm not trying to paint the Trump administration as a murderous cabal or anything like that, but just trying to make the murkey legal waters a bit clearer.  

So, let's consider the issue of ""collusion"" or conspiracy with the Russian government.  The report asserts that the Trump campaign *tried* to work with the Russian government to get information that would aid the campaign.  It documents the reasons that this didn't happen with incompetence/miscommunication on the part of the Trump campaign being the biggest cause.  

I think you can make a fair case for this then being **attempted** ""collusion"" (whatever that means).  To go back to our murder analogy, if the Trump campaign had been trying to kill someone with a peanut allergy by smearing peanut butter all over the steering wheel of their car, only to get the wrong car, their actions would still constitute **attempted** murder.  The Mueller report shows no harm done, but clear mal-intent here.

The report also details numerous cases in which Trump ordered people to take actions which would unquestionably constitute obstruction of justice, especially if you ignore the legal technicality of ""can the President obstruct justice.""  

Again, for our murder illustration, this is as if a mob boss ordered his enforcers to kill Vinny the Snitch.  Just because the enforcers decided not to kill Vinny, that doesn't make the boss' ordering them any less of a crime.  In a courtroom you'd have to prove that the boss expected that his orders would be followed but ""I didn't expect the people who work for me to do as they're told"" is a pretty weak defense.  

Barr's summary of the report and Trump's summary shift the goal posts.  They essentially declare victory as ""any report which does not indict the President on charges of collusion and obstruction"" but, as I mentioned above, the report was **never** going to do that because it was authored by the Justice Department.  These victory conditions were assured before Mueller even unlocked the door to his office.

The real question is not ""is the Justice Department going to march Donald Trump out in cuffs"" but ""did the President take actions which justify a congressional investigation and/or impeachment proceedings.""

I think Mueller has put that ball firmly in Congress' court.  He's established that Congress has a responsibility to **consider** impeachment.  But impeachment is a political process, so what comes next is less about what Trump did and more about what Congressional Democrats think will happen next."
1068,Ask_Politics,"If sanctuary cities are a problem, why does Trump think that sending immigrants to them will solve the problem, and not just make it worse? Isn't that like throwing gasoline on a fire to put it out?","I'm thinking that it's a foggy-headed attempt to:

4. Get everyone riled up about something other than his perennial legal problems and conflicts of interest."
1069,Ask_Politics,Why as Americans are we so focused on Federal gov’t when our states are “the size of countries”?,"Recently, I was introduced to the idea that politicians in the early 1900’s intentionally drove interest in the federal government as a way to combat tribalism and racism. 

[Article that explains it a bit](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/a-time-of-tribalism-amy-chua/) Here’s a quote:

>President Woodrow Wilson saying that “America does not consist of groups” — a statement that was bonkers on its face in a time of legal segregation, among other things. But that was the myth that Wilson wanted us to believe, and that many white Americans wanted to believe.

The article doesn’t articulate my point exactly, but it approaches this idea that progressives and (classical) liberals of the late 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized interest in the fed as a way to bring people out of their respective tribes and get them to think of each other as being part of the same overarching group. "
1070,Ask_Politics,"Instead of trying to pass all these ridiculous heath care bills, why isnt the government taking the insurance companies to task for making health care so unaffordable in the first place?","It goes way beyond insurance companies, its doctors, nurses, drug companies, medical equipment manufacturers, hospitals.  A major problem you have with emergency care is it doesnt work like a normal marketplace where you have the opportunity to cost compare and choose a doctor or treatment to fix your issue, its basically Im gonna die, fix me. And as a result, there is no cost pressure on anyone to compete for business. As a result, medication or surgery will cost whatever the market will bear, which is fairly high when it comes to life or death situations. Likewise, what do you think it should cost for chemotherapy or surgery? I as a ""consumer"" of these products, have no idea. If it costs $1 million per patient, should I get these life saving treatments for the cost of my premiums or should we essentially leave that only to wealthier individuals?"
1071,Ask_Politics,Why is Bernie Sanders considered a political outsider when he has been in office for several decades?,"He's a lot further left than most American politicians, and except for last year's primary he's been an independent."
1072,Ask_Politics,What the fuck is happening in South Sudan?,"It's an extremely young country (officially broke away from Sudan in 2011) led by former rebel fighters rather than people with much professional government experience.  Administration is therefore very ad-hoc and amateurish, and power is built almost entirely on personal and familial relationships, rather than civil traditions or bureaucratic rules and institutions simply because those things have not had time to develop.

Now that the Sudanese government in Khartoum is no longer a serious threat to their independence, internal divisions, especially among different tribes, have increased.  The President and Vice-President were from different large tribes, and had increasingly become political opponents.  But since there's no entrenched tradition of democratic resolutions to political conflicts, there was significant tension and fear that any contest between them would be fought with violence and force of arms rather than by votes.  Apparently last week that tension bubbled over into actual fighting, as rumors of the Vice-President being arrested prompted a violent reaction from his tribesmen, which was interpreted as an attempted coup by the President's faction, with the result that both sides have now ended up in an *actual* fight.

Most of the immediate details I got from the Economist's [article](http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21591896-factional-violence-new-country-may-be-getting-out-control-two-elephants) on the conflict, which is now several days out of date, so I can't speak to how the military situation has evolved over the last few days.  Obviously this is very bad news for South Sudan's prospects as a functional country.  Democracy is always vulnerable to breakdowns in its early stages, and oftentimes people aren't convinced of the wisdom of the democratic process until they've grown weary and scared of the bloodier alternatives."
1073,Ask_Politics,How did the Dakotas become so deep red?,"The Dakotas have always been very conservative (though there has been some progressivism historically in ND).  They are more rural states, so this is not surprising.

Even when they would sometimes elect Democrats those Reps/Senators were still pretty conservative overall.

In more recent years with the partisan and ideological divide between conservative/GOP vs progressive/Democrat getting wider and wider, I do not think it's a surprise that these states are getting deeper red.  For a number of years there was also a lot of migration of young people from the Dakotas to other states, skewing the states further red."
1074,Ask_Politics,What are the democratic candidates proposals on dealing with the federal debt?,"The only one I know of for sure talking about cutting spending is Bernie, specifically on the military budget. I haven't seen specific numbers, but there's enough to cut there to balance the budget."
1075,Ask_Politics,"Why is ""quid pro quo"" the central argument?",">  I don't understand why the call itself isn't enough.

My best stab at this is:
- The call raises sufficient suspicion that _one needs to investigate_.
- The current open depositions and the closed depositions are a phase of _gathering evidence_. Nobody has accused anybody of anything yet.
- When the House votes on the impeachment articles, it will _accuse the President of crimes_. This hasn't happened yet.
- Then the Senate runs a trial.

The reason for this complicated process is that one needs to be super careful in a matter of this gravity."
1076,Ask_Politics,Which decade was statistically more politically violent and/or divided: the 1960s or the 2010s?,"The 60's by far. You had racists gunning down protesters with firehoses.  You had major political figures assassinated, including the President of the United States JFK, MLK, Bobby Kennedy, who would likely have been the Democratic nominee for President, and Malcolm X. The nation was at the brink of nuclear war with the Cuban Missile Crisis. You had the FBI plotting to have MLK kill himself.  You had a war where people were drafted. The President had to send in the national guard just so black children could go to school. There is no question which decade was more chaotic."

1078,Ask_Politics,Why does the president of USA have the power to shut down the goverment?,"The president doesn't have the power to shut down the government, the legislature could pass a veto-proof budget (which they have the votes for) and it would end.  The Senate is currently refusing to do this, so that's why we are here. It's the legislature deciding to let the president make this choice."
1079,Ask_Politics,Why has Trump's approval rating barely fluctuated?,"[President Trump’s Approval Rating Has Been Steady. Richard Nixon’s Once Was Too.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/president-trumps-approval-rating-has-been-steady-richard-nixons-once-was-too/)

Essentially Trump has lost all Democrats and independents, but the vast majority of Republicans have stood by him and will do so until they don't, after which the end would come very quickly.  It's anyone's guess what would finally be the tipping point, if there is a tipping point.  Whatever it is, it hasn't happened yet, and might not happen for a very long time.  For Nixon it was the tapes; for Trump, who knows?"
1080,Ask_Politics,Was the Obama Administration's nuclear deal with Iran a good deal?,"The deal was to remove sanctions in return for Iran not developing nuclear weapons. 

According to UN inspectors, who are allowed to enter any military facility or any facility they think might have nuclear material, Iran has kept its part of the bargain.

The criticism of the deal is that Iran is making nuclear weapons anyway, and now there's no longer any leverage because the sanctions were lifted. But there's no proof that Iran is creating these weapons or that the deal was violated.

It is very reminiscent of the invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration was adamant that Sadam had weapons of mass destruction, even though UN inspectors found none. And we all know how that turned out.

If you don't want Iran to have nukes, the Obama deal is good. If you want war with Iran, then the Obama deal is bad. "
1081,Ask_Politics,"How likely is it that because Donald Trump is ""getting away"" with so many scandals, that it will set a trend of future politicians brushing off otherwise career-ending scandals?","Scandals really hit much harder when they defy your expectation of a person, but otherwise don't really matter.  For example, Bill Clinton was known to be a bit of a womanizer, so when the impeachment occurred, he still kept a very high approval rating.  In contrast, when George W. Bush claimed to have given up alcohol decades ago, yet a DUI arrest surfaced from much sooner, it breaks you expectation of him that he set.

Donald Trump was always known to be a sleazebag billionaire-type, so him cheating on his wife with a porn star is something that no one was surprised about.  He's known to be a deal-maker, so him making deals with Russia really doesn't change your perception of him at all."
1082,Ask_Politics,What does it say about society or politics when a nominee can just tell a lie and no one rebuts or seems to care?,"For many, faith trumps facts.  So many, in fact, they might be choosing our next President.
I blame a shitty education system that turns out graduates who aren't curious and can't think and most of all, a media that overwhelmingly is superficial and treats its audience like the fickle idiots they have gradually become.

2016 is when we're going to realize the world-changing power of stupid."
1083,Ask_Politics,Why doesn't Hamas blow up the wall?,"Just a shame the Al-Jazeera op-ed is so horrifically biased, but I suppose that is the nature of an op-ed. Unfortunately, I can't even say I agree with the opinion. The idea that the wall could simply be breached and then people could stream through is quite ludicrous.

Not only is there a 300 meter buffer zone in place, which is stringently monitored by the Israelis, there's more to it than that. One has to ask themselves: what does Hamas gain from such an action? Also, what does it lose?

First and foremost, the death of Palestinians trying to cross the border who are shot at by Israelis (if they are shot at all, instead of merely restrained by IDF forces, if they manage to cross the wall) would be squarely on Hamas. The world opinion would *not* square with them on that one, especially if a *single* Hamas operative was caught amongst those civilians. Even so, the civilians would likely have to be coerced, which would be a story the Israelis could then use if a single one of them admits to it, which they likely would. And in such a case, not only is Israel justified in firing on them (as morally repugnant as it sounds) in order to ensure the integrity of its borders during wartime and protect its citizens, Hamas is guilty of the clearest and most indisputable war crime of human shields yet. And it would be broadcast everywhere for the world to see, that Hamas was willingly sending its citizens *into a war zone*, knowing the buffer zone existed, trying to take down a wall that is not only very high-tech but has observation points all around it and IDF forces on standby near Gaza quite often. Never mind including the fact that it would serve virtually no purpose besides making Israel construct it again, which is far less demoralizing (especially since the wall's characteristics make it hard to take down, I'll get to that later) than hitting infrastructure and directly harming Israelis, and therefore it's less valuable. If the *entire* wall went down and Palestinians could stream into Israel, that'd be one thing. But the likelihood of that many breaches in the wall, and the likelihood that such breaches would have Palestinians immediately pouring through them, and the likelihood that IDF forces wouldn't be able to stop such breaches from being exploited with the tens of thousands of IDF troops, machinery, and technology...well, quite frankly the point of making the normal Israeli civilian face the conflict head-on that the Al-Jazeera op-ed linked elsewhere in the thread is not served by such a thing. Tunnels and rockets do a much better job for Hamas to demoralize and otherwise bring the reality of the conflict to the average Israeli, and that's the goal after all, since an outright military victory isn't possible for Hamas: they hope to demoralize Israel, make it less cohesive, and get world opinion against Israel.

For the record, why don't we take a look at the wall/fence itself, to see exactly what stands in the way of anyone getting out, and what would be required to get through it. I can source all of what I say in terms of which facts I'm providing (I may misremember one or two slightly, ie. the distance of the buffer zone or something, but you get the idea I think), but I'm going to rely on Daniel Byman (who is a professor at the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University, and very well versed in counterterrorism and Israeli counterterror operations and methods) in his book *A High Price: The Triumphs and Failures of Israeli Counterterrorism* to discuss the barrier. What it has as features:

>When the Second Intifada broke out, Palestinians destroyed or stole much of the Gaza barrier. It was later replaced and upgraded with better sensors and overlapping observation posts. The Israelis also bulldozed potential hiding places on the Gaza side to make observation more effective. The new systems include remotely operated weapons systems, enabling soldiers sitting a few kilometers away to target suspected militants without exposing themselves to fire. On both sides the IDF leveled and cleared a three-hundred-meter strip and installed watchtowers to monitor it.

Also note what the West Bank barrier has, that is likely (to some degree) installed in the Gaza barrier system:

>...the barrier is both a chain-link fence and a concrete wall. It is surrounded on both sides by an intrusion-detection system, which has a set of around sixty electronic and other systems that take up at least forty-five meters on its sides. At its center is a wire fence with sensors and video cameras. A military road runs along the Israeli side so patrols can speedily converge on any intruder. Also along the Israeli side are sand traps or a smooth dirt strip, where an intruder would leave footprints, designed to reveal the path of any Palestinian who crosses illegally. On the Palestinian side there is a ditch to stop vehicles. Both sides have a mini wall of razor wire...Only a small part of it, thirty kilometers or so, is a concrete wall [mostly near populated areas].

So, all this noted, would Hamas really be able to infiltrate through the wall, or send people through it, even if they could breach small portions of it? With the overlapping observation posts, the weaponry required to hit the wall properly and breach it, the fact that it would serve virtually no purpose besides forcing a speedy rebuilding of the wall and helping Israel build the case for the wall's need, the sensors alerting to any breach, the buffer zones, the difficulty approaching the wall, the remote controlled machine guns, the IAF, and so much more...what does Hamas *gain* by this? Quoting Byman again:

>One reporter told me, “When you talk to Gazans about why they launch Qassams that kill nobody but lead to deaths on their own side, you get a proverb like, ‘He broke my legs but at least I spit at him.’” Hamas also tried to use rocket attacks to show its defiance in the face of IDF raids and force Israel to open the crossings into Gaza. Rockets offered Hamas the flexibility of targeting Sderot or even major cities like Beersheba and Ashkelon, and of executing two attacks or twenty.

This is, essentially, what I'm saying. Attacking the wall isn't even spitting at Israel. It's just wasting time. The wall is 25 feet high, (fences are around 6 meters in height, 19-20 feet or so?), concrete in many places, and otherwise very difficult to breach. Hamas could fire rockets at it, sure, but it's firing rockets that are unwieldy, can't be fired within 300 meters of the wall, may end up landing in Gaza instead, etc. They could maybe hit it with some mortars, but how effective would such mortars be? It's one thing to hit a city with a mortar and have shrapnel kill someone unprotected, it's another thing entirely to breach a concrete wall and then use that breach without being caught and killed with just mortars.

Too little benefit to the overall Hamas goals, too much difficulty, no way to really make any use of the hole in the wall even when one goes through. Hamas would likely have an easier time tunneling and avoiding trying to blast their way through a wall they couldn't get through undetected, and sending rockets to try and hurt the Israeli morale and civilian populace.

By the way, in case anyone thinks the economic costs are a great incentive for Hamas to make Israel rebuild the wall, let's provide some figures really quickly. According to [this source](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8747823/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/israel-plans-barrier-around-gaza-after-pullout/#.U_5TlYBdWiA), preliminary estimates for the cost of the barrier were $220 million. Let's assume it ended up at *double* that, just to be on the safe side. That means $440 million.

For the entire wall. Not just for a breach, for an entirely new barrier.

Because of the Gaza conflict during Operation Protective Edge, the [Israelis spent roughly *$585 million* within the first 12 days of fighting.](http://www.haaretz.com/business/.premium-1.606091). That's from the government spending. Now, what about Hamas rockets? Do they do more economic damage aimed at the wall, or at the Israeli infrastructure and civilian population?

[Well, it looks like it's the latter](http://www.haaretz.com/business/.premium-1.606091):

>In addition, it is estimated that the economy has sustained another 1.2 billion shekels in economic damage in the form of losses suffered by businesses, lost workdays and direct physical damage sustained in Israel as a result of the hostilities.

Again, that is within the first 12 days. Within 12 days, roughly $330 million was lost in the economic damage, thanks to rockets. That's more than the initial estimate of the entire Gaza border wall, and well...by now, the cost has almost definitely ballooned to be more than the cost of the Gaza wall. The loss of tourism, the little time spent by some airliners no longer flying to Israel, the business costs, the infrastructure damage, the damage to Israeli morale, lost workdays, and more are far more costly to the Israelis than repairing a fence/wall. By the way, [by August 7th](http://news.yahoo.com/israels-2014-budget-absorb-cost-gaza-conflict-finance-083249452--business.html) the cost to the Israeli economy by August 7th was estimated at $2.89 billion, at least $500 million of which is lost tourism inflows. While Israel has a strong economy that is *absolutely* a better score for Hamas than, as I said, destroying a barrier that cost less than just the costs to Israel's tourism industry from firing *over* the wall, not at it."
1084,Ask_Politics,"What exactly are the loopholes, exemptions and laws that the top .1% are exploiting?","This is actually a decent question. I sorta dig when people ask for specifics on talking points--keeps people honest. So here's my best effort:

The important thing is to know what you're looking for. If you're hoping to find are the ways that a CEO, whose yearly salary is $10,000,000, gets away with paying no taxes on that income, don't bother. That's taxable. The trouble is that there are lots of ways of acquiring wealth that do not qualify, for tax purposes, as ""income."" ""Income"" is a very specific term. 

By way of example: Let's say Mr. CEO hires a worker, Mr. Digger, to dig for valuable minerals on his land. Mr. Digger finds a bunch of gold and is rewarded for his efforts by Mr. CEO with a $1,000,000 bonus. Mr. Digger pays for that $1,000,000 bonus because that's income for him. But let's say that gold is worth $100,000,000. Mr. CEO can go to a bank now and borrow money in the amount of $100,000,000 (with the gold as collateral), live large, and pay little or no taxes on that $100,000,000 he gets to spend because it was not income, as defined in the tax code. Now granted, this is a pretty unusual situation, but it shows how having lots of existing assets can make it possible to live very comfortably without having a taxable income. 

The second way is perhaps more common. Returns on investments--or the amount of interest you receive on a loan, the amount you managed to resell a stock that is in excess of what you paid for it originally, etc--are taxed at about half the rate of ""normal income."" On a policy level, this is justified because it incentivizes people to turn portions of their income into investments, which ostensibly produces growth in the larger economy. But there's a legitimate argument about whether or not the larger economy would be better off with the tax money than with the small amount of growth that this tax break produces--at the very least, these tax breaks have been shown to produce very little investment that the wealthy wouldn't have done anyway (prompting the question: why do we have these tax breaks?).

The charitable donation system is the third way and it too is extremely common. Income or an investment, no matter how it is acquired, that is donated to charity is not taxed AT ALL. If Mr. CEO has a preferred stock option (which is a stock that pays him based on the performance of the company the stock is from) and he donates it to a charity that he's set up, that charity can get by with only spending 5% of its worth per year. This means that, in effect, everything Mr. CEO funnels towards his charity gets ""taxed"" at a rate of 5%--except it isn't taxed, it's being spent on charitable purposes. Again, there is an argument that the federal government would get more out of the ~40% of the charity's value than society gets out of the 5%.

The fourth major loophole is the rarest, but also (I think) the most unpalatable: special exemptions. Certain luxury items that are purchased exclusively by very wealthy people can be bought tax-free. Yachts, airplanes, those sorts of things. All of the money spent on these sorts of things can be ""written off"" (which is to say, if Mr. CEO spends $100,000,000 on a custom luxury yacht, the IRS will see it as though Mr. CEO made $100,000,000 less than he did this year--though more often the price of the yacht would be paid off over a period of years to lower Mr. CEO's taxable income substantially for a while... plus he also gets a yacht). 

Those are the three most common ways--there are many, many others though. 

With the exception of the fourth way listed here, none of these are by their nature impossible for those who make a middle class salary. The reason these methods aren't used is that there is often a high opportunity cost, or cost required to avail yourself of these ""loopholes."" You need an accountant--and they don't come cheap. You need to pay the establishment fees to set up your charity, or your trust, and you need to foot the bill for the finance fees on your stock options. You need to dedicate a great deal of time and energy toward paying less in taxes, and unless your income is exceptionally high, I expect you'd decide the effort isn't worth the payoff."
1085,Ask_Politics,Which Senators Missed the NSA Briefing on Friday?,"Doesn't it seem odd that there would be a briefing to the entirety of the senate? What would make more sense is if the members of the intelligence committees attended and then on Monday when they got back those members would then tell their conferences what was said. 

I mean, it's just odd for all the senators to be in one place at one time. And it's odd for a briefing to have that many people at it. "

1087,Ask_Politics,What is the effect of legislative body size on its function as a legislating body?,"Generally, the size of the legislature doesn't have a significant impact on its efficiency. 

The bigger impact is the system itself (i.e. Presidential/Congressional or Parliamentary), and the level of partisanship experienced.

It's been known for a pretty long time that parliaments are more efficient. Parliaments require greater levels of cooperation and compromise, which is inherent to the system. The reason being that in Parliaments, the body itself can be dissolved any number of ways, in whole or in part. You also end up with more coalitions in Parliaments due to the need to develop an absolute majority to form a government.

So overall, parliamentary systems, particularly the Westminster System, work better.

The US falls squarely within Duverger's Law. In systems where voters have a single non-transferable vote (SNTV), with single representative districts, and plurality-based winners (you don't need 50%+1, you just need more than anyone else), you will tend to have a two-party system. When you only have 2 parties you tend to compromise less. Because with only two parties, one party tends to be the ""winner"" and the other tends to be the ""loser."" Whereas in multi-party systems, no single party can win all the time, and just because they didn't win doesn't necessarily mean they lost either. So two-party systems, when paired with polarization of the public, can truly become ""us v them"" scenarios."

1092,Ask_Politics,Is is normal for a president to approve an airstrike against another nation without knowing the full details?,"It would be very unusual to approve an airstrike without having a very good sense of the potential outcomes, at least for a location not already in open warfare.  Presidents are generally briefed very extensively; this president has a sizeable history of ignoring briefings or demanding they be very short, and being generally disinterested in them.  so it'd be plausible he simply cut short a briefing because he'd decided on a course of action, or that he was not paying attention to the briefing.

&#x200B;

I should also note that we only have second-hand accounts, and those accounts could be inaccurate, so we're not wholly sure what happened.  It's possible that there was no almost approved airstrike, and the goal is to appear reckless so as to inspire fear in Iran, and the leak of this info was staged.  Such tactics are not entirely unheard of."
1093,Ask_Politics,Why can't the Supreme Court simply say a legislature may not consider political affiliation of residents when drawing congressional districts?,"This is a complicated question.

1096,Ask_Politics,Has a sitting US President ever sued private citizens?,"To my knowledge - no. In my opinion: No president would ever want to either. 

In the past sitting presidents have been sued by private citizens (Jones v.

I imagine the courts would be less sympathetic to the president's hectic work schedule. "

1098,Ask_Politics,"As a Brit, why are we deemed 'Adult' enough to vote on leaving or remaining in the EU, but we aren't adult enough to have a referendum on Cannabis legalization?","The Conservative party has no motive to introduce a referendum on cannabis legalization. David Cameron  proposed the EU referendum mainly to please eurosceptic members of his own party, even though  he himself is against the UK leaving.

1099,Ask_Politics,"If victims of 9/11 can sue Saudi Arabia for 9/11, does that mean victims in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Pakistan, etc can sue the US for drone strikes and the like?","The United States has a law called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act which prohibits a civil suit against another countries. This is out of respect for international and customary law that places a large emphasis on respect for the sovereignty of other states. One of the exceptions to this law deals with terrorism and provides a basis for a suit against a foreign government. So if the 28 pages contains particularly damning evidence that links the Saudi Government to the hijackers, the law passed by the senate would be permissible under U.S. law. On the international law side, I imagine that claims of state immunity would be referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) where they would provide a more definitive answer. 

In terms of reciprocity, I can't imagine any suit originating from those countries getting any traction for three reasons. The first is that, especially in recent times, the threat of terrorism invokes the 'protective principle' which is grounds to establish national jurisdiction in cases where action needs to be taken against an actor (terrorist groups) in foreign nations to prevent attacks at home. I feel that this argument would have traction in the ICJ. The second reason is that while those nations possess legal personality and power in the international legal system, they lack the resources to bring a successful suit against the United States unless they were represented by another nation. Lastly, international law does not apply equally and is affected by the power difference between actors; in many cases, the U.S. will trade political favors to make cases disappear before reaching the ICJ."
1100,Ask_Politics,"If it was a pro-Russian milita that shot down MH17, what are the likely repercussions?","[This article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/07/17/what-would-it-take-to-shoot-down-mh17/) from today does a good job providing an idea of the likely circumstances surrounding the incident.  I would believe that a relatively inexperienced separatist at the controls of an AA system provided by the Russians was responsible for shooting down this plane.

Such a person wouldn't have the training to recognize the differences in aircraft of similar size.  The enemy (Ukrainian forces) has total air supremacy, using their attack helicopters and jets to bomb your positions, and uses their transport aircraft to move troops.  Earlier in the day your side achieved a small victory in shooting down 1 fighter and nearly bringing down another (its disputed as to whether separatists or Russians are responsible for these 2), and earlier in the week a comrade found glory in taking down a transport plane.  You see a prospective target on your radar, it can't be your side as explained earlier, and its your time to shine - so you send the missiles.

It would be hard to believe the Russians would be responsible, because they would have the training and the equipment to better identify what's flying where, and it would only hurt them to make such a stupid mistake and be found responsible.

It would be similarly hard to believe that it was Ukraine for similar reasons as the Russians.  They have fighters patrolling the border (like the ones shot down earlier), and the plane wouldn't sneak up on their airspace because it was coming from the West.  All of the fighting is taking place in the East.  Someone might suggest a ""false flag"" operation to blame the other side, but what would be the point?  Ukraine is winning.  Russia just received more sanctions.  It would be utterly idiotic to even take the chance.

As for the consequences, I don't see there really being any until we find out more about what happened.  If its the separatists, not much will come of it other than demands by the West for Russia to do more to get them to the peace table (unlikely).  If its the Russians, just more sanctions.  If its Ukraine, a large publicity backlash and temporary withdrawal of support from the West.  I don't see much coming from this simply because the whole situation is already a big mess, and everyone involved has a lot riding on their reputations already."

In the Wikileaks case, Bradley Manning has been charged with a crime and the news agency (Wikileaks) is merely the one that reported the facts (displayed the information). 

Julian Assange has not been charged with any crime in the US nor anything related to the Wikileaks case. The US has not even asked to question him about it. He is sought for questioning by the Swedish Government related to a possible sex crime, but the US has not charge him with anything. "
1104,Ask_Politics,Why has Detroit actually become such a horrible place?,"""In 1950, when Detroit had 1.8 million people, about 200,000 were employed in manufacturing, according to Kevin Boyle, the author and professor of history at Ohio State University, who is a native Detroiter.

1105,Ask_Politics,Can a disbanded political party be remade years later?,"One of the biggest blocks to a third or new political party coming into viability is the two main parties themselves. They have established a market lock on electoral politics by setting up the grassroots machinery, stocking and staffing the state party organizations, raising money to be distributed to state parties and candidates, establishing the rules of electoral politics once their members are in office, and heavily influencing if not outright how polls, turn halls and debates happen.

A lot of these rules literally crush young parties and third party candidates before they reach an adolescent stage. So the two dominant parties have made a mutual agreement to smother all potential rivals in the crib."
1106,Ask_Politics,"Where does valid criticism/scrutiny of religion end, and ""anti-faith bigotry"" begin?","It begins when religion itself targeted, rather religion's influence on politics and policy.

I'm a devout believer and former clergyman, and I 100% support getting religion out of politics. But I don't support things like taxing legitimate religious organizations or banning people from sharing their faith in public spaces.

Any church that openly supports a political candidate or party, however, should lose its nonprofit status. The tricky bit is when religious issues become political issues, like  some churches had happen with things like divorce, abortion, homosexuality, civil rights, and slavery. 

The church's stance shouldn't affect policy, but it's also hard to tell a church not to talk about issues they've had moral stances on for centuries that become political.

It's a fuzzy line and I think a lot of people on both sides don't see the other side's point of view. The religious people may see it as a spiritual morality issue, while the non-religious may see it as a political issue, and neither recognizes the other's position."

The presiding officer can hold it open as long as necessary.

The point is to give members adequate time to vote.  They are guaranteed at least 15 minutes.

Here's a congressional research service report about the house voting procedures if you want to learn more~

[House Voting Procedures: Forms and Requirements](https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/b79ade62-94d9-4e91-9883-70b00f76a708.pdf)

>Under Rule XX, clause 2(a), the minimum time for a vote by electronic device is 15 minutes in either the House or the Committee of the Whole. The 15-minute period is the minimum time allowed, rather than the maximum, for the conduct of a recorded vote. The chair has the discretion to hold the vote open longer. The voting period for some votes may be shorter than 15 minutes under certain circumstances.

1110,Ask_Politics,How can elected officials campaigning for a higher office justify taking a full salary as a legislator ?,"If Senators campaigning would not get paid despite their absence, then guess who would benefit from this? People/Senators who are already rich and don't need that salary in the first place. It becomes a hurdle for middle class salary-dependent senators to campaign or do anything other than the day to day grind. I remember how AOC faced similar issues when she became a congresswoman. She had to move to DC and set up her living conditions and her offices, while not being able to receive a salary for ~3 months until she was sworn in. Being a middle class person with no wealth of her own that was a big issue for her.

I mean the exact same logic can be applied for Presidents. Everything is paid for in the WH so why give them such a massive salary of 400k when they only need to look after personal expenses like clothes? 

It's a way to level the playing field so that people who do not come from wealth can also be part of the political life AND not be susceptible to bribery due to personal economic hardships."

1116,Ask_Politics,Why do people oppose things like LGBTQ+ and women's rights?,"I guess I'll speak for myself as someone who used to hold some anti-gay views. It was pretty much just religion for me (Evangelical Christianity, to precisely zero surprise I'm sure). I didn't like seeing gay kissing or anything sexual ""in my face"" because 1. It just grossed me out and 2. It was unnatural and a sin.

Why didn't I question it? Well, I did, secretly. It was hard for me to justify my view because there was nothing in the Bible about *why* this was wrong. It was just spoken about as if it was obvious. Well, if that was the case, I guess it should be obvious to everyone, because the Bible is never wrong, duh!

It was just something I didn't think much about and when I did, I knew I wasn't gay and it felt unnatural *to me*, I had Biblical foundations for my feeling, so therefore it's unnatural to *everyone*. Why would people choose this lifestyle? Because they're perverted and hate God in their hearts of course!

I had a friend come out as gay in high school. He just sort of said it one day and I guess he was hoping for a welcoming or at least understanding reception. There was none and the jokes and mocking started immediately, not usually to his face, but usually within earshot. I wish I could say I didn't join in, but I did.

For a variety of mostly unrelated reasons, I became atheist a while after. One of the things I noticed is that I didn't actually hate gay people. I just hated what they represented. It was confusion because I didn't understand why they would ""spite"" God and not just choose to be ""normal."" It was fear because the thought of part of my foundational worldview being wrong wasn't something I wanted to challenge. And it was infuriating because I couldn't actually give solid reasons for why I felt like this, and moreover why I often *didn't* feel this, because I know I was just *supposed* to feel like this.

It's very odd being on the other side of this now, with most of my family coming out against transgender rights. I don't really know how to speak to them because I know what got *me* out of this way of thinking, but I don't know if it would even be worth trying to engage them. I guess I would if we knew any transgender people, but we don't, and most of their opinions are just from Fox and their church.

I can't honestly say whether I would be welcoming of gay marriage and transgender rights if I was still a Christian. Again, I'm only speaking for myself, and I know there are plenty of Christians who have a positive relationship with gay rights (hell, there are Christians who are gay themselves!)

However, this is the fundamental problem with certain Christian views. ""Liberal"" Christians have no problems with recognizing that parts of the traditional worldview are flawed, but for ""conservative"" Christians, it's all or nothing. I don't know how to fix this way of thinking other than attacking the entire flawed narrative, which is next to impossible unless you're open to it.

It took me *years* and many sleepless nights to finally drop my worldview. It was not easy. Many people are very entrenched in this and the only advice I can give is to just chip away at them by being a walking contradiction to everything they believe. Be the upstanding, respectable person you already are. Over time, they could start to doubt themselves and why they think what they think. I can't promise a complete 180 like in my case, but you may be surprised by what you see."
1117,Ask_Politics,"After the election the Republicans will likely have the Senate while Democrats will have the house; what change, if any, will occur in state governors?","Just as Democrats are massively overexposed in the Senate races, Republicans are similarly overexposed in governors' races. There are 36 governors' seats up for election, 9 currently held by Democrats, 26 held by Republicans, and Alaska held by an independent. 

The nine Democratic seats are in California, Hawaii, New York, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Democrats are favored in eight of the nine by both Cook Political Report and Real Clear Politics; Connecticut is listed as a toss-up in Cook but Likely D (not lean D) in RCP. I think Oregon and Rhode Island are the two most vulnerable states as the Democratic lead is smaller in the available polling. Just because they're blue states doesn't mean they can't elect a Republican (see Massachusetts and Maryland).

Alaska looks like a Republican pickup. Mike Dunleavy has led by 15 and 20 points in the three-way race against incumbent Bill Walker and Democrat Mark Begich. It may well be the only Republican pickup.

Most of the drama will be in Republican-held seats. Cook has Illinois (likely D), Michigan, and New Mexico (both lean D) as favorites to be Democratic pickups. It also lists 9 Republican-held seats as toss-ups, and the list is a doozy. Florida, Maine, Ohio, Nevada, and Wisconsin make sense. So do the somewhat redder Georgia and Iowa. 

Kansas and South Dakota are also toss-ups in Cook's ratings, and the polling backs that up in Kansas at least. The four polls RCP lists for KS-Gov all have Laura Kelly (D) and Kris Kobach (R) within 1 point in either direction. I can't find any RCP polls for South Dakota, and only one polling organization is listed on Wikipedia as having polled the state--it found Kristi Noem (R) in the lead in July and Billie Sutton (D) in the lead in September. RCP has Kansas as a toss-up as well, but has South Dakota as likely R (not lean R).

Oklahoma's rated as lean Republican by both Cook and RCP. Drew Edmondson (D) had led in a couple of polls in the summer, but Kevin Stitt (R) was ahead by 3 points and 6 points in two September polls.

Arizona is rated likely R by Cook and lean R by RCP. Much like the borderline lean/likely D states, this is a case where Doug Ducey's (R) lead isn't in runaway territory but it's been clear and consistent.

Notably absent from the list of pick-ups, toss-ups, and leans are Maryland (likely R), Massachusetts (safe R), and Vermont (safe R). Blue states on a national level, but their incumbent governors have a ton of crossover appeal.

Overall, the expectation should be a net gain of seats for Democratic gubernatorial candidates, to the point where a Democratic majority of governorships is in play even if it's a tough goal to reach. Currently, 33 governors are Republicans, 16 are Democrats, and of course Bill Walker is an independent. If every solid/likely/lean seat went the way Cook predicts and every Cook toss-up stays with the incumbent party, 31 governors would be Republicans (-2) and 19 would be Democrats (+3). If Republicans win all the toss-ups, change that to 32 for Republicans (-1) and 18 for Democrats (+2). If Republicans win all the toss-ups and all the leaners in both directions, they would actually increase their majority to 37 (+4) and Democrats would be down to 13 (-3). If Democrats win 50% of toss-ups, they would have 24 governors (+8) to the Republicans' 26 (-7). If Democrats were to win all the toss-ups, they would have 29 governorships (+13) to the Republicans' 21 (-12). And if Democrats were to win the toss-ups and the leaners, their best-reasonable-case scenario is an advantage of 30 (+14) to 20 (-13). 

So there's a pretty wide possible spread of possible outcomes, and of course not all toss-ups are created equal. But I think the median scenario is Democratic pickups and a slimmer Republican majority of governors."

> Article 9 (Separation from parents): Children have the right to live with their parent(s), unless it is bad for them. Children whose parents do not live together have the right to stay in contact with both parents, unless this might hurt the child.

> Article 10 (Family reunification): Families whose members live in different countries should be allowed to move between those countries so that parents and children can stay in contact, or get back together as a family.

Nevertheless, the average separation time of child from parent at the border is four months (though some separations go on much longer) and the purpose isn’t to erase an ethnic, religious, cultural identity through forced assimilation. Yet even these relatively short forced separations can be incredibly traumatic, and the way we separate — telling the parents we are giving the children a shower and then spiriting them away — is incredibly immoral.

1120,Ask_Politics,Could Democrats have pushed harder for Obama's right to fill Scalia's empty seat on the Supreme Court?,"There's not really anything they could have done. When there's a Republican majority, there's a Republican majority. They could stall endlessly as far as I know (until midterms tipped out of their favor or so). Under the circumstances the Democrats couldn't have done much but kick up a fuss and hope the public would care enough. Unfortunately, the public didn't, and it's a shame that political polarization has gotten so bad that Republicans felt somewhat justified in halting their duties long enough to bank on a Repub president.

1121,Ask_Politics,"ELI5: If my girlfriend and I both go to vote today at the same location, with me voting for Bernie and her voting for Hillary, is there a point to us going? Or do the votes cancel each other out since they are both for competing front runners?","Each party allocates delegates to each state based on the number of registered voters for that party rather than the state's overall population.  Those two votes increase the number of registered Democrats by two thus increasing your states say in nominating the party's candidate.

Edit:  Also, sometimes there are state and local ballot initiatives, tax levies, etc, on the ballots during primary elections.  It is important to vote those too."
1122,Ask_Politics,Did anyone hear Cruz say when he's President he'll instruct the Dept of Justice and IRS to start persecuting religious liberty?,"I heard it too, but I'm pretty sure he just misspoke. I think what he meant was stop persecuting religious liberty."
1123,Ask_Politics,Why is there such an insistence on public transport systems breaking even? Isn't the point of such a system to be somewhat redistributive?,"Republican chiming in:

From the sense of redistribution, I feel that there's a net gain in a well-regulated and well-maintained public transportation solution like light rail. It does a lot of great things for an economy, and would probably expand a tax base enough to cover its continual maintenance and then some. 

- DUIs are expensive, and motor vehicle accidents are the second largest cause of non-disease related death in the U.S. after suicide. That impacts growth in lost productivity, creates a massive burden on insurers (actually the insured pay for this), and disproportionately affects those in the prime of their life.

- Affordable public transit increases the commuting range of the poor while negating the need for a vehicle and insurance. That means that a similar quality of life can be obtained with a lower income. It also means that a dishwasher making $10-15 an hour in an expensive restaurant in an expensive area wouldn't have to live close to his place of work but could commute on a train from cheaper suburban apartments instead. 

- Public Works and maintenance always have the potential to be a massive jobs program which can increase consumption in the long run. That's not to say we ought to hire 400 unemployed people to dig a ditch that one heavy equipment operator could dig in the same time, but it would certainly create a floor in our construction industry that has been more subject to real estate bubbles than that of Germany and Japan. 

- Expanding the economic range of businesses, customers, and laborers increases the degree of competition in their shared economic zone. 

- Selfishly, I love to go out for a few drinks. I also don't want to live near the places I drink at. I also don't want to spend a fortune on a cab or Uber when I could spend a fifth to a tenth of the cost on public transport. I'm not the only one. I also don't think we should base our urban zoning laws on the needs of people like me who like to show up on Friday to drink and need a parking spot - land which could be a park, a business which pays taxes and employees, or a public walking area.

1124,Ask_Politics,How come the Federal minimum wage law(s) never made it so that it would be adjusted for inflation every year? How come there is only a push for it now?,"Chris Matthews wrote a book with a pertinent anecdote about this very issue. Matthews was an aide to Tip O'Neil and if I recall correctly, he (or someone else) proposed a bill to index the minimum wage to inflation, seeing that congress kept having to raise it. But no one wanted to support such a measure.

The reason, according to Matthews, was it'd rob politicians of one of the things to gloat to constituents that they'd voted for, come re-election. Not indexing the minimum wage to inflation meant they get multiple votes on a popular issue.

This was in the 80s, when raising the minimum wage had more support than it does today."
1125,Ask_Politics,Why is there no large-scale infrastructure megaproject in progress in the United States?,"Big capital appropriations for mega projects don’t seem to be a priority for this administration and Congress, especially with the enormous state of good repair backlog and overall lack of maintenance on roadways that are reaching the end of their useful life.  Administration has specifically stated that transportation spending will be focused on rural areas."
1126,Ask_Politics,Communism is such a good and logical idea on paper. What makes communism “fail” when actually put into action? Why are we taught that it’s so much worse than capitalism? How are they different?,"Communism relies on the ""good of man"" to want to work for eachother. 

This work fine in small units: Take for example a household - one partner may not have a job, housework is shared, goods(such as a car, tv, etc.) can be shared freely according to who needs what; Or within small communities, people are very happy to share within their community, or with their close friends; or take a guild in an mmo - they often share freely between their members, to work together for the greater good of the guild.

However, once you start talking about society as a whole, people will not be motivated to work ""for the good of society"". People can see the work is fairly shared between a household, and can call out their spouse if they feel it is wrong. People cannot call out the guy on the other side of the country for not doing enough, and thus quickly lose motivation, as there is probably a million other people slacking off as well.

This is the main reason that communism seems to fail: If you receive no reward for working harder - or perceive there to be no reward, then people will be hard pressed to do a good job.

As for why capitalism is so much better? In short, it isn't. This is mainly a left-over from the cold-war(and before that, too), where propaganda told us that communism is scary, bad, and a failure. However, Pure Capitalism will lead to exploitation of people, monopolies, the rule of money, and loads of other horrible things. We need to remove the worst excesses of capitalism by installing very anti-capitalist measures: a minimum wage, social security, anti-monopoly laws, rules to exclude money from politics, protection policies on the environment, etc. 

In a similar way, one could imagine that even though ""pure communism"" does not work, communism with some capitalist measures could lead to a fine outcome. Examples of such a state would be a system were people who work at a company automatically become a partial owner of the company(to make sure every man sees part of the profit of his work). Or, on the other side, keep the system capitalistic but give out a basic income to everybody, to ensure a fair minimum even if you can't work for whatever reason.

On a final note, remember that even though communism has major problems, so does capitalism. Take a look at todays world. All the poverty, exploitation, third world dictatorships, etc. etc. are part of the capitalistic system. Only because they are part of the status quo, they are seen as ""unavoidable problems"", rather than ""fundamental problems with capitalism"". It may be that a communistic system would create other problems, but it would also be able to solve other problems. And maybe if we were to build a communistic society, we would call the problems we face then as ""unavoidable problems"", rather than ""fundamental problems with communism"""
1127,Ask_Politics,What are some good examples of how deregulation has helped the economy. How much has it helped the economy?,"Apologies that my thoughts on this are all over the place. It's a complicated question. Any regulation has pros, cons and unintended effects in a very complex economy. A good answer would require a couple hours for me to write and organize. And I'm on a phone in a train. 

One clear example of a success is that Dodd-Frank imposed very high accounting costs on banks that use money from customer savings as capital for investments.  This overhead could easily be absorbed by huge banks, but small local Banks were at huge disadvantages. They just couldn't afford it. So the regulation got lifted for banks over a certain size.

Other areas where deregulation that has made people a ton of money is in our treatment if trusts and corporate entities that currently protects 100s of billions of dollars from being taxed and accounted for, as well as being protected assets (ie, you can't sue them if they harm you. So someone can run a scam, make 100 million by ripping people off, but only have a million in assets they can be sued for when the class action lawsuits comes around.) It's basically a giant set of loopholes to allow the very rich to be unable to be sued, have to pay taxes, or launder money. 

Some recent high visibility deregs from Trump include:

Getting rid of net neutrality has been good for the telecom giants. 
Getting rid of school standards has been good for for-profit universities and charter schools. 
Getting rid of telemarketing standards has allowed a whole new hosts of scammers to make money off the stupid. 

But there are like thousands more too arcane to even be worth a mention on C-SPAN.


The deregulation of airlines, Telecom, and energy has basically been a flop since those industries have such immense barriers of entry. But it did add new players and some exceptions, like Southwest Airlines. They did come into being as a result of deregulation and provide new customer value. 

One big issue with regulation and deregulation is that  it almost always favors the incumbents who can bank roll major lobbying efforts. So the way we regulate and deregulate tends to be done in a fashion to protect the interests of the status quo from upstart innovators. 99% of regulation is arcane that only a few folks really understand. And those that do spend money 24/7 to get their standard adopted. And there is no way the public can be knowledgeable enough to understand or keep up. So it's a huge source of high dollar and low risk fund raising for politicians. 

For exame, uf you set a new fireproof standard for kids clothes, or a new shape for a car bumper, the folks able to retool their factories for 100M will beat the small guys who simply can't do it because they don't have the sales volume to justify the change.  You see this in all oligarchies throughout the world and you see it more and more in the US. And yes, both sides do it. One side a little more than others."

1129,Ask_Politics,Why is Facism Considered to be Conservative?,"In ""How Fascism Works"" by Jason Stanley, he touches a little on this in the introduction.

> Fascist politics includes many distinct strategies: the mythic past, propaganda, anti-intellectualism, unreality, hierarchy, victimhood, law and order, sexual anxiety, appeals to the heartland, and a dismantling of public welfare and unity. [...] In the United States today, Republican politicians employ these strategies with more and more frequency. Their increasing tendency to engage in this politics should give honest conservatives pause.

Paraphrasing another point he wrote, based on my bad memory right now, fascism is on the extreme end on the right side of the political spectrum. **That doesn't mean a person who's a conservative doesn't favor fascism any more than a liberal doesn't favor communism on the left.**

I'd argue that what you said about conservative beliefs has a lot to do with sociology with the conservative demographic. There was definitely an evolution where they rallied behind one person to be their voice after being told things like ""nothing is your fault. It's theirs (us vs. them)"", ""all the traditions and things you've held dear are being taken away (the mythic past)"" just for example.

I can go into much more detail, but this should at least help give you an understanding."

1131,Ask_Politics,How to Start Following Politics?,"The first and most important thing you already mentioned: **Follow the news.** Do it often and try to follow certain topics. Sometimes it is difficult to get into the topic because you don't know the background, but if you read the news often, that will get better and better. Also use different news sources, to get different perspectives, that will help you to stay critical.
 Also **use Wikipedia** if you don't understand something, it is very helpful and can make things a lot easier. Really use it often, it is a great instrument to understand current debates.

 Also **ask people** what they think about this certain political debate and talk about it. Some people are very good informed and can explain you a lot and even if they have no idea about anything(which happens a lot more), but they will ask questions and if you can answer them, you getting more secure about it or learn what you need to research;)

I strongly oppose the advice to read the books about political philosophy. That doesn't really help you at your current state of political interest and they are a long, difficult and complicated  read which is often just useless  (sry guys;)) If you are interested in political philosophy, read a book which summarize it first. It will be a lot easier and way more efficient. But it isn't necessary, if you aren't interested in that.

What I really recommend is to **read a history book**, focusing on modern history. It will help you understand why things are like they are, it will give you background in international relations and it will help you a lot to understand certain behavior. 
**Learn about the political system in your country**- Use a book, use wiki, use the Internet. Usually people have just a really shallow knowledge about how their countries really work. If you know how the political system works, you will understand a lot more.

Sorry I don't have any titles for you, I am not English native, but shouldn't be too difficult to find a decent history book and one about the political system."

1133,Ask_Politics,"Assuming that Iran did shoot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, why?","Accidents happen in warfare. This wouldn't be the first time a civilian airliner was shot down by a conventional military let alone a group of overzealous amateurs working with military tech outside their training range. \[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airliner_shootdown_incidents)\]

Terrorist groups usually take credit for their work. Otherwise no one would be terrified of them thus nullifying their primary legitimacy claims. There are plenty of terrorist groups operating in the Middle East, so it's of course a possibility, but the list of groups with access to anti-aircraft tech inside of Iran is quite short and most of them support the regime. Most intelligence agencies are suggesting that a missile struck the plane, not some kind of internal explosion-- barring such a report, I think terrorism is pretty low on the list of possible causes. It's quite difficult to move a big artillery piece around without anyone picking up on it.

I don't know how you'd suppose that the American military managed to get inside Iran, take over an anti-aircraft artillery piece (or bring one with them), operate it, and then exfiltrate undetected, but I suspect if there was some ghost of evidence (frankly even if the Iranians thought they could reliably fabricate some), I imagine that we'd already have heard about it-- probably right when they announced the accident in the first place. Typically when accusations of false flags in the Middle East come up, the usual scapegoat is Israel, but again, if that was at all conceivable I imagine the Iranians, their state media, and their allies would have already been pushing that story."
