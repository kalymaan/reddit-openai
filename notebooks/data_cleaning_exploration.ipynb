       "'I will forever beat the drum that scientists need to work less and develop some class consciousness. This is exactly what I mean. Really, you need to just fucking stop it. No meetings, no discussions, just stop it. Work 9-5 and be hard on yourself about that. What’s the fucking worst thing that will really happen? Maybe this psycho doesn’t renew your contract. Oh no, heaven forbid, you don’t get to work with this guy for another 3 years? Jesus Christ, please give yourself a shake. Your time is valuable. You are not in some Bangladeshi factory, you won’t be beaten or insta-fired if you decide to work human hours. \\n\\nLet me tell you this: whatever scary thing you are afraid will happen if you start acting like a normal person, it’s not worse than what will happen if you keep this up. I lost two years of my life to a mental breakdown in the middle of my first attempt at a PhD that I ended up quitting on the worst possible of terms. If I could go back in time I’d beat myself senseless until I agreed to stop drinking the Kool-Aid. Stop drinking the Kool-Aid! You don’t have to do this, you have agency. I will never side with these exploitative scumbags but at a certain point it is on you for letting yourself be completely steamrolled without standing up for your own fucking interests, because of what, peer pressure?\\n\\nJoin a club that starts at 6. Maybe a martial art, something that lasts more than an hour. Get a dog. Get a hobby and hold yourself to doing it. Do not set up experiments that will keep you past 5 or on the weekends. Become one of those obsessive clock watchers. Embody Stanley from The Office. Nothing will fucking happen.\\n\\nYour PI might say they are concerned. They might say they are disappointed in you, they might give you a lecture about how science must be your hobby and vocation rather than a job. They are your enemy, ignore them. If you step back and think about it, it’s a bit laughable that you are honestly considering not availing yourself of your legal right to holidays because your PI said it would be “inconvenient”. At that point you’re just letting yourself get dommed by your literal class enemy.\\n\\nYou should know something that is basically a universal rule in work: The more you give, the more they take. You keep working like a slave, they will keep expecting that output and be disappointed when you falter. What you need to do now is recalibrate their expectations by simply stopping. No work after 5! And that includes emails. \\n\\nI insist that you develop a life and personality outside the lab. There are libraries filled with books that you may never read, how can you tolerate it? How can you tolerate staring a lab/computer when there is so much to experience in this world? And it’s yours to experience if you get a grip. Stop underestimating your value and your leverage because your coworkers do. Stop being so affected by your boss saying the kinds of things bosses always say. Step off the hamster wheel, and stop believing the bullshit.  Science is a job, not a calling. If someone out there has a comfortable life with secure employment and maybe a nice traditional nuclear family with a traditional housewife cooking and cleaning at home, so that they can consider science a “hobby” or a “passion” that’s nice for them. The rest of us are being exploited by them breaking our bodies and spirits to help them solve their little intellectual puzzles and pad their trophy shelf. \\n\\nJust stop now, it’s on you and no one else at this point.'"

       "'I will forever beat the drum that scientists need to work less and develop some class consciousness. This is exactly what I mean. Really, you need to just fucking stop it. No meetings, no discussions, just stop it. Work 9-5 and be hard on yourself about that. What’s the fucking worst thing that will really happen? Maybe this psycho doesn’t renew your contract. Oh no, heaven forbid, you don’t get to work with this guy for another 3 years? Jesus Christ, please give yourself a shake. Your time is valuable. You are not in some Bangladeshi factory, you won’t be beaten or insta-fired if you decide to work human hours.  Let me tell you this: whatever scary thing you are afraid will happen if you start acting like a normal person, it’s not worse than what will happen if you keep this up. I lost two years of my life to a mental breakdown in the middle of my first attempt at a PhD that I ended up quitting on the worst possible of terms. If I could go back in time I’d beat myself senseless until I agreed to stop drinking the Kool-Aid. Stop drinking the Kool-Aid! You don’t have to do this, you have agency. I will never side with these exploitative scumbags but at a certain point it is on you for letting yourself be completely steamrolled without standing up for your own fucking interests, because of what, peer pressure? Join a club that starts at 6. Maybe a martial art, something that lasts more than an hour. Get a dog. Get a hobby and hold yourself to doing it. Do not set up experiments that will keep you past 5 or on the weekends. Become one of those obsessive clock watchers. Embody Stanley from The Office. Nothing will fucking happen. Your PI might say they are concerned. They might say they are disappointed in you, they might give you a lecture about how science must be your hobby and vocation rather than a job. They are your enemy, ignore them. If you step back and think about it, it’s a bit laughable that you are honestly considering not availing yourself of your legal right to holidays because your PI said it would be “inconvenient”. At that point you’re just letting yourself get dommed by your literal class enemy. You should know something that is basically a universal rule in work: The more you give, the more they take. You keep working like a slave, they will keep expecting that output and be disappointed when you falter. What you need to do now is recalibrate their expectations by simply stopping. No work after 5! And that includes emails.  I insist that you develop a life and personality outside the lab. There are libraries filled with books that you may never read, how can you tolerate it? How can you tolerate staring a lab/computer when there is so much to experience in this world? And it’s yours to experience if you get a grip. Stop underestimating your value and your leverage because your coworkers do. Stop being so affected by your boss saying the kinds of things bosses always say. Step off the hamster wheel, and stop believing the bullshit.  Science is a job, not a calling. If someone out there has a comfortable life with secure employment and maybe a nice traditional nuclear family with a traditional housewife cooking and cleaning at home, so that they can consider science a “hobby” or a “passion” that’s nice for them. The rest of us are being exploited by them breaking our bodies and spirits to help them solve their little intellectual puzzles and pad their trophy shelf.  Just stop now, it’s on you and no one else at this point.'"
