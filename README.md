Here is my project submission for GA's DSI fellowship. 

Each notebook will have a detailed summary and walkthrough of my process. CSV data files are in the data folders and the notebooks that generate them give a good decription of the datasets. 

For this project, I'm pretending to be a DS consultant hired by Reddit to improve bot detection amongst the userbase. **The Executive Summary is below the File structure.**

### Executive Summary

In the age of digital communities, Reddit stands as a vibrant hub for diverse discussions. Yet, a shadow looms over this platform in the form of automated bots, jeopardizing the authenticity and trustworthiness of user interactions. As a seasoned data science consultant, I present a potent solution that promises to address this pressing issue effectively.

Reddit's soul resides in genuine human engagement. The infiltration of bots threatens this core essence, eroding user trust and undermining the platform's credibility. We recognize the urgency of this problem and the need for a robust bot detection system that can safeguard Reddit's integrity.

I've engineered a classification model boasting an impressive ~90% accuracy in distinguishing between responses generated by ChatGPT and those crafted by human users. Leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques, this model is ready to serve as Reddit's guardian against bots.

These are the subreddits I scraped from with the percentage of data from each:
   - AskScience             0.100790
   - AskAnthropology        0.094097
   - AskSocialScience       0.085665
   - NoStupidQuestions      0.081783
   - TrueAskReddit          0.076161
   - AskProgramming         0.069469
   - AskStatistics          0.066390
   - AskHistorians          0.063981
   - answers                0.063713
   - AskGames               0.060634
   - Ask_Politics           0.058627
   - AskAcademia            0.047785
   - AskPhilosophy          0.045509
   - AskReddit              0.032793
   - AskMen                 0.026636
   - relationship_advice    0.013385
   - AskWomen               0.012582

The time has come to unite our efforts and take a stand against the encroaching bots on Reddit. Together, we can usher in a new era of trust and authenticity, reaffirming Reddit's status as a beacon of genuine online community. Let's embark on this journey and secure the future of Reddit, where human voices reign supreme.
